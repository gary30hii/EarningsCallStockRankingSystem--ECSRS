I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nEugene Hall: Good morning and thanks for joining us. 2020 was an extraordinary year. The COVID-19 pandemic, global macroeconomic conditions, social unrest and geopolitical changes all pose significant challenges to enterprises around the world. In this context, Gartner delivered a strong performance across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. As many of you know, we entered 2020 with a financial plan to align costs with revenues. By executing this plan and taking swift cost actions when the pandemic first began, we quickly stabilized our financial position. We maintained disciplined cost management throughout the year over strong investments to support future growth. We successfully pivoted our global workforce to operate effectively in a remote environment. We grew our capability in key functions across our business. We drove strong operational execution and we were extremely agile in serving our clients. Pivoting our content to address critical contemporary issues, such as the pandemic, remote work environments, cost optimization and business continuity. We're well-positioned to spring back quickly as the macroeconomic environment improves. Our performance improved in Q4 compared to earlier in 2020. We delivered strong performances in GTS contract value, research revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow. Research is our largest and most profitable segment. It is a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. Our Research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. We are uniquely positioned to support leaders enterprise wide on hundreds of critically important topics. Topics with the highest interest during Q4 included data and analytics, cost optimization and talent management. Global technology sales or GTS serves leaders and their teams within IT. For the full year 2020, GTS contract value grew 4%. Our key underlying metrics have improved each quarter since Q2. Fourth quarter 2020 contract value from New logos was up from a year-ago, while capsules were about the same. Our existing clients continue to increase their spend, however, it was a slower pace than in 2019. This was the biggest factor impacting our growth in the quarter. Client engagement continue to be strong with both content and analyst interactions up 30% versus 2019. We saw strong performances across several regions and industries, including tech, retail and services. Some of the topics with the highest interest included digital transformation, application development, cloud management and the digital workplace. We expect GTS contract value growth to accelerate in 2021 and return to double-digit growth in the future. Global Business sales or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value continue to perform well throughout the year with contract value growth of 7%. New business growth was a very strong 26% in the quarter driven by our GxL product line. The sales, finance and HR practices all ended Q4 with double-digit growth rates and all practices with the exception of marketing contributed to GBS's growth. Across our entire research business, we've practiced relentless execution of proven practices, and we're seeing the results of our efforts. Our research business is well-positioned to return to sustained double-digit growth over the medium term. Turning to conferences. As many of you know, our Conferences segment had great momentum coming out of 2019. It was hard hit in 2020 by the global pandemic. To replace our traditional in-person destination conferences, which were no longer possible in 2020, we pivoted to virtual conferences. The performance of these conferences exceeded our expectations in 2020. And now with several months experience under our belt, we've got a set of best practices that will continue to refine. Our value proposition for virtual conferences remains the same as for in-person conferences. We deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. Beyond virtual conferences, operationally, we're preparing to return to in-person conferences in the second half of 2021. Gartner consulting is an extension of Gartner Research and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project based work. Our Consulting segment was also impacted by the pandemic with revenues down 12% in Q4, and 5% for the full year 2020. Over the past several years, we've made great progress in our consulting business, and it will continue to serve as an important complement to our IT research business. Company-wide, we continue to strengthen our stance against racism and discrimination. We appointed a new leader of diversity, equity and inclusion. We established a center of excellence dedicated to improvement in this area. And we strengthened our employee resource groups, which helps remove barriers for diverse populations and support associate engagement. Sustainability is an important factor in how we manage our business. For example, we signed contracts for our Stanford headquarters and our U.K hub to be powered by 100% renewable energy. We will be eliminating single use plastics across our offices. And finally, we're benchmarking our environmental footprint and development programs to minimize it over time. Summarizing, we perform well in the context of a pandemic. Looking ahead, we are well-positioned for sustained growth. We expect to return to revenue growth in 2021 and are on track to return to double-digit CV and revenue growth thereafter. We expect to deliver 2021 EBITDA margins up 2019 and to further expand margins over time. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which will deploy to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases, and make strategic tuck in acquisitions. With that, I'll hand the call over to Craig. Craig?\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning. I hope everyone remains safe and well. Fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations headlined by a strong performance in GBS, better-than-planned cost management and outstanding free cash flow generation. As our 2021 guidance highlights, we expect total revenue to increase versus 2020, while also positioning Gartner for return to strong growth. Looking out over the medium term, we continue to expect double-digit CV and revenue growth, modest margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Because we can fund growth investments we have ample capital to return to shareholders and to deploy to strategic tuck in acquisitions when we find the right opportunities. Our Board authorized an additional $300 million for repurchases bringing a total available to around $860 million. Reviewing our year-over-year financial performance for the full year 2020, total contract value increased 4%; total FX mutual revenue was down 3%; FX neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 20%; diluted adjusted EPS was a strong $4.89 and free cash flow was $819 million, up almost 100% from 2019. We did see some timing benefits, which I will discuss a bit later. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, down 8% as reported and 9% FX neutral. Excluding Conferences, our revenues were up 2% year-over-year FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, up more than 580 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $245 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 10% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $1.59 and free cash flow in the quarter was a robust $237 million. Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% on an FX neutral basis. Fourth quarter research contribution margin was 72% benefiting in part from the temporary cost avoidance initiatives we put in place starting in the first quarter of 2020. So contract value grew 4% FX neutral to $3.6 billion at December 31. This was the highest contract value in Gartner history, a notable achievement and a challenging year. For the full year 2020, Research revenues increased by 7% both on a reported and FX neutral basis. The gross contribution margin was 72%, up about 240 basis points from the prior year. Global technology sales contract value at the end of the fourth quarter was $2.9 billion, up almost 4% versus the prior year. The selling environment continued to improve in the fourth quarter, but we are still seeing less upsell with existing clients than normal. Our clients are staying with us, but not adding as much incremental CV as we've historically seen, given the challenging economic environment. Moving forward, we expect win backs and a return to more expansion with existing clients to contribute to growth in 2021, consistent with our experience coming out of the last downturn. By industry, CV growth was led by technology, retail and services. While retention for GTS was 98% for the quarter, down about 600 basis points year-over-year, a majority of our industry group saw retention improved from the third quarter. GTS new business declined 5% versus last year, an improvement from both the second and third quarters. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global business sales contract value was $696 million at the end of the fourth quarter. That's about 20% of our total contract value. CV increased 7% year-over-year. CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. The sales, finance and human resources practices all recorded double-digit CV growth for the year. All practices contributed to the 7% CV growth rate for GPBS with the exception of marketing, which was impacted by discontinued products. That said, our marketing business saw improving retention rates and a return to year-over-year new business growth in the fourth quarter. While retention for GBS was 101% for the quarter, down 43 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 26% over last year, led by very strong growth in HR, finance and legal. As with GTS our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Overall, GBS continue to demonstrate its resilience and strength as we exited 2020. The Conferences segment was materially impacted by the global pandemic as you know. During the year, we pivoted to producing virtual conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver for our clients. We held 13 virtual conferences in the fourth quarter. We also held a number of virtual Evanta meetings, shifting these one day local conferences online due to the pandemic. Conferences revenue for the quarter was $93 million. Contribution margin in the quarter was 78%. Our fast transition to virtual conferences has been positive for the overall business. As we discussed last quarter, virtual conferences offer significant value to our research clients and prospects. And while we've shown that we can run virtual conferences profitably, it is important to recognize the different economics associated with virtual versus in-person conferences. Similar to last quarter I'd highlight two primary differences. First, mix of revenue from attendees and exhibitors has essentially flipped. With the in-person format, approximately two-thirds of revenue comes from exhibitors, and one-third from attendees. In a virtual format, we've seen about two-thirds of revenue come from attendees. Second, the vast majority of our attendee revenue has continued to come from research contract entitlements, as opposed to incremental tickets. I'd also highlight that our fourth quarter destination conferences have historically been our largest, most profitable conferences. In 2020, we held our biggest most highly anticipated conferences of the year in the fourth quarter in a virtual format. For the full year 2020, revenue decreased by 75%, both on a reported and FX neutral basis. Gross contribution margin was 48%, down about 290 basis points from 2019 as we maintain some of our costs of service as well as SG&A despite the lower revenue. We did this to ensure we were in a position to execute our new virtual conferences, and to resume in-person conferences when it is safe and permitted. Lastly, the timing of receiving conference cancellation insurance claims remains uncertain, so we will not record any recoveries in excess of expenses incurred until the receipt of the insurance proceeds. Fourth quarter consulting revenues decreased by 10% year-over-year to $94 million dollars. On an FX neutral basis, revenues declined 12%. Consulting contribution margin was 26% in the fourth quarter, down about 160 basis points versus the prior year quarter due to lower contract optimization revenue, which usually flows through at high margins. Labor based revenues were $73 million, down 10% versus Q4 of last year or 12% on an FX neutral basis. Labor based billable headcount of 730 was down 10%. Utilization was 63%, up about 300 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at December 31 was $100 million, down 14% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. Our backlog provides us with about 4 months of forward revenue coverage. Our contract optimization business was down 9% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter. As we've detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. Full year Consulting revenue is down 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX neutral basis, and its gross contribution margin of 31% was up 68 basis points from 2019. SG&A decreased 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up year-over-year as we restored certain compensation and benefit costs and had significantly less revenue from conferences. For the full year, SG&A decreased 3% on a reported and FX neutral basis. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $245 million, up 13% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 10% FX neutral. As we have seen improvements in the macro environment, we have resumed growth spending and started to restore some of the compensation and benefit programs, which we've put on hold when the pandemic first hit. Fourth quarter EBITDA benefited from several factors. First, we've continued to maintain very strong cost discipline across the company. Second, we had better-than-planned revenue performance in research and conferences, which flowed through with very strong incremental margins. Third, we had planned for an increase in certain costs such as travel, which didn't materialize due to pandemic related shutdowns. And finally, we had been conservative in our implied fourth quarter guidance given the geopolitical uncertainty due in part two the U.S election, rising COVID counts and a still recovering global economy. Depreciation in the quarter was approximately $4.5 million from last year, including expense acceleration from facilities related charges. Amortization was down about $800,000 sequentially. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $26 million flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. The Q4 adjusted tax rate which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 25% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 28.4% in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate for the full year was 21%. Adjusted FPS in Q4 was $1.59. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $4.89. EPS growth for the year was 25%. Note that about $7 million of equity compensation expense, which we normally would have incurred in the fourth quarter has shifted into the first quarter of 2021. That was a benefit to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of about $0.07. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $260 million, compared to $83 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by cost avoidance initiatives, improved collections and timing of tax payments. CapEx for the quarter was $23 million, down 57% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate expansion needs due to the pandemic. We defined free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the quarter was $237 million, which is up about 700% versus the prior year. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 20% on a rolling four quarter basis. continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow was well in excess of GAAP and adjusted net income. Adjusted for timing and one-time benefits, 2020 normalized free cash flow margin is around 13%. We had a fantastic year for free cash flow driven by the resiliency of the business, continued strong collections, disciplined cost and cash management and lower cash taxes and deferrals of certain tax payments. We took a number of actions in 2020 to further strengthen our balance sheet. We had two successful bond offerings and amended and extended our credit facility. We reduced our maturity risk and our annual interest expense will be lower starting in 2021. Our December 31 debt balance was $2 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA is about 2.5x.  At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $713 million of cash. We resumed our share repurchases after pausing earlier in the year, buying back $100 million in stock at an average price of $156 per share. The Board recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $300 million because we have significant capacity for buybacks from cash on hand and expected free cash flow. As of February 8, we have around $860 million available for open market repurchases. We expect the Board will refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. We will deploy excess cash for share repurchases and strategic tuck in acquisitions. Before providing the 2021 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2021. For Research, most of our 2021 revenue is determined by our year end 2020 contract value. As we move through the year we will revisit the Research revenue outlook. For Conferences, our guidance is based on being 100% virtual for the full year. Operationally, we are planning to relaunch in-person one day events in the third quarter and in-person destination conferences starting in September. Our guidance includes fixed costs, primarily people and marketing related to both a full year of virtual and in-person conferences. We've excluded the variable costs, primarily venue related associated with the in-person conferences from our guidance. We've been able to run profitable virtual conferences in 2020 and that is reflected in our 2021 guidance. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. The economics in 2021, even in a partial in-person year, won't be fully back to normal. As we get closer to the go, no go decision point, we will provide additional insight to sizing the incremental revenue and profits. For Consulting revenues the compares get easier as we move through the year. We have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. For expenses, we have planned for the full reinstatement of benefits that were either cancelled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase and certain other benefits. We are also returning to growing our sales forces, with planned quota-bearing headcount growth in the high single digits for both GTS and GBS. We've also planned for several additional programs, including technology investments. The impact of most of these expense restorations or investments impact our P&L starting in the second quarter. As you know, travel expense was close to zero from April through December. Our current plans assume a modest ramp up in travel related expenses over the course of 2021. Most of this ramp is built into the second half of the year. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings. Our guidance for 2021 is as follows. We expect Research revenue of at least $3.815 billion, which is growth of at least 5.9%. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $160 million, which is growth of at least 33%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $390 million, which is growth of at least 3.6%. The result is an outlet for consolidated revenue of at least $4.365 billion, which is growth of 6.5%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $760 million, which is a decline of about 7% and reported margins of at least 17.4%. This is based on conferences running virtual only. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $102 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $4.10. For 2021, we expect free cash flow of at least $630 million. This is before any insurance proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellations. It is also important to note that we've revalued our contract value at current year FX rates which had a modest overall impact. Our 2020 ending contract value at 2021 FX rates is $2.9 billion for GTS and $706 million for GBS. Details were included in the appendix of the earnings supplement. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Finally, we expect to deliver at least $200 million of EBITDA in Q1 of 2021. In summary, despite an unfavorable economic environment, we delivered better-than-planned financial results in 2020. We had outstanding free cash flow and strong EBITDA. We strengthened our balance sheet and move quickly to implement cost avoidance initiatives while still investing for future growth. While there is still uncertainty in the macro outlook, our contract value held up better than in the last downturn. We were able to launch and monetize virtual conferences and virtual Evanta meetings. We will continue with targeted investments and restoration of certain expenses to ensure we are well-positioned to rebound when the economy recovers. As I mentioned at the start of my remarks, looking out over the medium term, we continue to expect double digit CV and revenue growth, modest margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Because we can fund growth investments we have ample capital to return to shareholders through our buyback programs and to deploy to strategic tuck in acquisitions when we find the right opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yes, thank you. Good morning. On GTS upselling, I guess, how does it compare to the last downturn anything you're doing operationally different? And I guess any signs that having a higher penetration rate in terms of number of seats per average client coming out of this downturn could be a constraint?\nEugene Hall: Hey, Jeff its Gene. So compared to the last downturn, GTS, in fact the whole company, we took a lot of lessons from the last downturn in terms of operational execution. And we've been better all the way around in terms of operational execution. And so, I think that the -- in terms of every aspect of the business like it looks at new logo growth in Q4, that was very good. Even though, obviously, it's still a tough economic environment out there, et cetera. So I think basically, our operational execution is what that it was during the last downturn.\nCraig Safian: And, Jeff, hey, good morning. It's Craig. The other thing I'd add is while we have increased the penetration since the last downturn, we still look at our penetration as sort of woefully under penetrated. Even in our existing enterprises, we're talking about on average four to six seats generally. And so we continue to believe there's an enormous opportunity to continue to penetrate existing enterprises.\nJeffrey Meuler: Got it. And another \u2026\nEugene Hall: In fact, there's a lot of growth in existing -- go ahead, Jeff. I was just saying that there's a lot of growth in existing enterprise as well. It wasn't quite as much as in 2019, but still significant growth in existing enterprises.\nJeffrey Meuler: Got it. And then I guess that you're going to give us more financial outlook commentary on Conferences as we get to the second half and know if they're happening in-person or not. But just any framework for thinking about incremental margins as that returns? I know that your guidance is assuming that you don't have the variable facilities based cost to execute in-person conferences, but I think you still preserved quite a bit of SG&A. So not sure how much that -- of that extra return just if you can give us any framework on incremental margins as conferences come back to in-person at some point?\nCraig Safian: Yes. Sure, Jeff. Happy to. And again, I mean, I think part of the challenge we have is, we hope we're in a situation where we're able to run a full in-person scenario in the second half of the year. It may vary depending on regions that opened up earlier than others, or certain restrictions that are in place. And so there's no easy yes or no answer here. The way we sort of think about it is, yes, you're right, we did maintain a team in conferences to be able to return to producing our fantastic in-person events, or conferences rather as soon as we can and that is baked into our base level guidance. Obviously, if we pivot to in-person, we generate a lot more revenue. The way we've thought about it in our modeling is it will flow through at historical incremental margin rates, roughly for conferences. And so if you look back to how our incremental margins flow through historically, that's what we're expecting as we make this pivot. Now the other thing I would mention is, as we do return to in-person and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks as well, we don't expect to fully return to the size and scale that we exited 2019 at. It's going to take a little bit of time to grow back and that obviously impacts the flow through economics as well.\nJeffrey Meuler: And I hope to see all of you at one of your in-person conferences later this year. Thanks, both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. Just while we're on Conferences, wanted to ask you've had about 40% monetization versus in-person for the virtual conferences. Is that similar to what we should expect this year? Or is there a progression that you could get higher than that? And basically, in terms of exhibitors, is there any progress that you've made on getting exhibitors involved in the virtual format? And just basically, should we expect sort of a similar model for monetization of conferences this year, ex the in-person obviously.\nCraig Safian: Hey, good morning, Toni. Thanks. Thanks for the question. In terms of the monetization, I would say we're still progressing on that, and I wouldn't anchor on that 40%. I think one thing to keep in mind is we did a really great job of very quickly pivoting and a great job of monetizing in the back half of this year. In the last 3 months of the year we ran our Global Symposium Series, which as you know, are typically and historically our largest, most profitable conferences. And we were actually -- we had significant pent up demand, if you will, from not being able to run conferences for the first several months of the year. I think -- so, again, we'll continue to refine our monetization and our ability to market to and sell incremental tickets to those virtual conferences. And so, again, we expect we'll get better and better at this as we move on. In terms of exhibitors, we did a decent job, I would argue, in the fourth quarter. While the revenue mix has shifted, as I mentioned, to being more attendee-driven, still a full third of our revenue was generated from exhibitors in the fourth quarter. And so I think similar to the attendee commentary I just gave you, we continue to get better and better at that as well by providing exhibitors the opportunity to meet with or get exposed to our highly qualified audience. And then on top of that, our attendees generally one of the things that they really put a lot of value on when they come to a conference is that exposure to the exhibitors as well. So I think both are works in process. We've gotten, as Gene mentioned, better and smarter at how we deliver it after each and every conference, and we will continue to refine that as we move forward.\nToni Kaplan: Great. And then in terms of GTS, how are you thinking about headcount growth strategy in '21? Will you start to ramp up ahead of demand or concurrent with demand? Just what are your thoughts on ramping that up? And are you still expecting 1Q to be the inflection point? Thanks.\nEugene Hall: Hey, Toni, it's Gene. So we are focused on long-term double-digit growth and headcount growth is an important part of that. And so as we go through '21, we expect to increase our headcount both in GTS and GBS not so much to impact '21, but really so we have the capacity in '22 to make sure we can hit very attractive growth rates in '22.\nCraig Safian: And Toni, just on the phasing, I think because of what Gene just mentioned which this is really about seeding the investments for '22 and beyond, you won't necessarily see an inflection point in Q1. Like most of our cost restoration and cost investments, we're really turning these things on from Q2 and beyond. So it really impact the P&L Q2 and beyond.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGary Bisbee: Hey guys. Good morning. Great job on the results and outlook. Craig, I wanted to ask about free cash flow. The last two quarters I feel like you've been discussing that a little differently. Historically, it was sort of a conversion rate as a percent of adjusted earnings that we talked about, now you're talking about a free cash flow margin. And frankly, it's a lot higher, right, if we go back at that old metric than it used to be. So I'm trying to understand, what's really driving this significant improvement in your free cash flow generation? And is that 13% of revenue a good bogey going forward, because the guidance implies a higher level than that in 2021? Thank you.\nCraig Safian: Yes. Good morning, Gary, and thanks for the comments and the question. So I think that, obviously, our business model is one that should generate significant amounts of free cash flow. And when we were in 2017 to 2019 timeframe, we were investing significantly both from operating P&L perspective and also from a CapEx perspective as we were dealing with all the growth. And we had some challenges with our collection pacing and DSOs and things of that nature as well. I think in 2020, we got everything back on track. And so we did a fantastic job on collections in 2020, especially in a really tough environment, which was great. And obviously that flowed through in 2020 and we expect to maintain that level of collection pacing moving forward. The other big factor I would say is CapEx. And so we had a significant amount of investment, as I mentioned, in capital expenditures, primarily behind facilities to support our very significant investment in growth and headcount. Obviously, we muted that in 2020. And our 2021 guidance assumes that we're going to run at roughly the same level of CapEx spending as we had in 2020. And I think moving forward, we can expect that to remain at roughly the levels that we are today, sort of in that percent of revenue range. So it will increase, but we don't see it going back to the roughly $150 million that we spent on it in 2018. So I think the combination of those two things and really getting the benefit of our upfront negative working capital model is what we're seeing flow through, and so we focused on it. We sort of straight from it for a year or two. We got real focus on it again, and we saw the benefits of that in 2020. Obviously, 2020 was sort of an extraordinary year with a lot of unique things in it. But you're right, our 2021 guidance for free cash flow margin, if you will, is even a little bit higher than that normalized rate that we saw in 2020. So we feel really good about the free cash flow generation capability and forecast and outlook moving forward.\nGary Bisbee: Great. And then just the other question, the other thing that really stood out to me was the 2021 margin a lot higher than what you indicated was likely a quarter ago. Obviously, revenue is trending better, and that's helpful. Is there anything else you would call out other than how the top-line is going? And I guess maybe as part of that, has your thinking progressed at all from last quarter around the potential for permanent cost reductions now that you've run the business through the pandemic? Thanks a lot.\nCraig Safian: Yes, I think that's a smart observation. I think as we progress through -- let me back up for a second. So when we entered 2020, our operating plan was essentially, let's make sure 100% that we have revenue growth and cost growth in line and set ourselves up to then be able to modestly expand margins moving forward. I think as we progressed through 2020 with an eye toward cost discipline and cost management, we were able to flex on things that we didn't necessarily think were possible previously. And so I think as we look at our cost savings that we generated and cost avoidance that we generated in 2020, portions of that were permanent and we'll be able to yield the benefits of that moving forward. Portions of them were what I would characterize as semi-permanent will get smarter around the way we spend in the future based on what we learned in 2020, and some of them will come right back, right? So like the benefit stuff that we saved and our compensation and benefit savings in 2020, we're obviously bringing that back in 2021 and we think it's really important from an associate perspective to keep everyone motivated and running toward our goals. But there certainly are things that we definitely see permanent and/or semi-permanent savings from that we learned in 2020 that will be able to help us manage to that better margin outlook moving forward.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. On GTS you mentioned we won't see an inflection in CV in 1Q, but rather in 2Q and beyond if spending comes back. Since 2021 CV largely depends on the 2020 sales force headcount, what are the assumptions underlying sales force productivity as you move through 2021?\nCraig Safian: Good morning, George. So the way to think about it is, we have invested in growing both our GTS and GBS sales forces over the past several years. Obviously, in 2020, we didn't do that. We actually paired down a little bit. We were able to work through a pretty large dense that we had built at the end of 2019. And so we feel really good about our capacity -- our sales capacity, our selling capacity entering 2021. And so we've got a significant amount of sellers in both GTS and GBS ready to go and tackle 2021. And so the way to think about the inflection and what we expect from a CV perspective is that, obviously, Q1 is the last, if you will, tough compare from a semi-normal environment and the compares to get easier in Q2 and beyond. So that's why we expect that inflection point from a CV growth perspective to sort of pivot upwards after Q1. I think there's a variety of different productivity scenarios you can run. If we're able to get back to 2019 levels of productivity, obviously, that would drive a really nice rebound and very significant contract value growth in 2021. But you can also get there getting somewhere in between where we finished 2020 and where we finished 2019. And so as we think about it, we believe that there is no reason why in the future, not necessarily in 2021, in the future, we can't get back to the productivity levels we were at pre-pandemic. It's going to take potentially a little bit of time to get there. But even if we glide up to that level, we can see a pretty nice rebound in the contract value growth for GTS over the course of both 2021 and into 2022.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. And then on GBS, in the quarter, you saw a significant upside there. Can you talk a little bit elaborate on what the sources of upside were and how you expect those sources of upside to persist into 2021?\nEugene Hall: Yes, it's Gene. I think the answer is that the clients and prospects see a lot of value in our offerings. We help -- we identify what their most important initiatives are and how they can execute them better. People have those challenges to address in good times and bad. And what we've seen is that the uptake from prospects and clients with the GBS products are really good, and that's because the value they see in them.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nTrevor Romeo: Hi. Good morning. You've actually got Trevor Romeo here in for Andrew. Thank you for taking my questions. First of all, just curious on GTS, if you could maybe give us an update on buying activity for clients that are kind of in some of the highly affected industries from the pandemic, like travel, hospitality, et cetera. And to what degree have you seen client win backs at this point? And how much opportunity do you see for further win backs in those areas in the future?\nEugene Hall: Yes, great question. So first, we -- even through the pandemic, we saw pretty good rates of buying -- renewal rates and buying from existing clients even in trouble industries. Not all clients were the same, some clients actually would go from five seats to four seats or something like that. And so we did see some of that. But overall, we saw a pretty good performance there. In terms of win backs, for the ones that did downgrade, and there obviously were some of those. Actually we are going to see win backs. And in fact, in Q4, particularly in December, we saw some win backs from some of the business we lost earlier in the year. As we go through '21, we would expect that to continue.\nTrevor Romeo: Okay, great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up. Within GBS, in the marketing practice specifically, have you now lapped the shift away from those lower margin products that you're going through? And how would you expect that vertical to grow relative to the other practices within GBS in the future?\nEugene Hall: Yes, marketing has a same great value proposition that the other GBS practices have. And as you pointed out, we had some products that we discontinued, which has dragged the overall growth rate down. But if you look at the products that -- if you separate that out, which we did -- we can do internally, obviously, the products -- the new products are quite attractive and are selling well. In terms of whether we've lapped, we've not quite lapped it, but we've got -- we've discontinued most of those products. Some of the clients were in multi-years and some of those multi-years extended into 2021. And so it will take 2021 to get through all of it, but again, the majority we've already gotten through of those discontinued products.\nTrevor Romeo: All right, great. Thank you very much for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just on the events business, you talked about the mix in attendees. I was just wondering if you could talk about Evanta, like the smaller events versus the bigger events, and perhaps you if there is a difference in profitability as well that you guys have assumed from virtual to in-person?\nCraig Safian: Yes. Good morning, Manav. Happy to. So I think as we mentioned, we have pivoted to virtual in both our destination conference portfolio and in our one day Evanta portfolio. And if you look at Q4 as an example, historically, Evanta contributed about 20% to our overall conferences revenue. It was a little bit higher than that in Q4, but not significantly higher than that. So it's been a pretty consistent contributor. They actually were able to pivot a little sooner to virtual just given the size of the communities and the size of the events or the meetings that they run. And so again, we're very, very pleased with what we've been able to do from a monetization perspective on both Evanta one day meetings and the destination meetings. We do believe as we look at our 2021 calendar that we will be able to return to in-person Evanta meetings, perhaps a little bit sooner, really dependent on the geography and what is allowed or permitted in those geographies. But we do think given the size of them that we'll be able to return to them a little bit earlier. But many event we've focused or we've pivoted to really driving virtual value in absence of in-person value, clearly I think our members and exhibitors in that business are itching to get back to in-person value, but we expect Evanta to continue to be a really nice contributor to the overall conferences portfolio.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. And then if I could just ask on your comments around M&A, just firstly, just a quick clarification. How much did TOPO add to the GBS contract value this quarter? But broadly, do you see more opportunities like dislocation because of your smaller, I guess, targets maybe not being able to handle it like you guys did?\nEugene Hall: Yes, Manav. I'll take the non-TOPO question. In terms of the number of small companies, there are a lot of small innovative companies out there. We track many, many -- I think hundreds of companies who are looking for innovative ideas that we can add into our portfolio. And so when we see it as a core part of our strategy where we see small innovative companies and it makes sense to buy rather than build. Obviously, we can -- in the absence of that, we can do just fine with organically, but if we can see M&A opportunities that are accretive and help strategically, we will certainly do that. And Craig on [indiscernible].\nCraig Safian: Hey, Manav -- yes, sure. Of course. I mean, actually TOPO CV was included in Q4 2019. So over the course of Q4 and the first three quarters of this year, it added about 60 basis points to the GBS growth rate. It's actually apples-to-apples in the Q4 numbers, so it didn't -- that's why you don't see any sort of dislocation really between the reported GBS rate and the organic rate given TOPO CV is in both balances.\nManav Patnaik: All right. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Henry Chien with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nHenry Chien: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess, just looking forward relative to other cycles, any suggestion that there might be some change in terms of the incremental or the new demand coming forward in terms of CV growth whether that's by industries or just any change in the character [ph] of this recovery?\nEugene Hall: Yes. Henry, every recession is different. We've tracked carefully what our performance was last recession to see if there's things that are indicative. One thing is for sure, which is, we are operationally much better. As we went through the last recession, we sat down and figured out kind of the things that work the best and we made sure we ran those plays very early in this recession. Obviously, one big difference was that we literally couldn't hold conferences. In the last recession, you would hold conferences. People might have been restraining the travel expenses. You had less people going, but not -- but we would actually hold them. That's very different than this year. And so I think one big difference in terms of how it recovers is, Craig mentioned earlier, we're looking forward to being able to -- we will continue the virtual conference and we had, but we also think that there is value in in-person conferences and look forward to go into those as we -- as the economy recovers.\nHenry Chien: Got it. Okay. Yes, I appreciate it. And I guess, just -- and in terms of perhaps contract value growth there or research growth, has there been any change or anything that you're expecting going forward in terms of just the -- yes, I guess, the characterizing the recovery?\nEugene Hall: I would say two things. One is that our -- again, because we are operationally better, I think the CV growth will hold up better than it did the last recession, it has been already. And I do think that for the ones that we -- for clients that did decide to buy four seats instead of five or maybe even discontinued altogether, just like the last recession, we will see some uptick from that. And so there will be some clients that come back to give us a boost as well over the next several months.\nDavid Cohen: And Henry, the one thing I would add is, obviously, from a medium term outlook or medium term objective perspective, no change in how we're thinking about the market opportunity or our ability to grow both the GTS and GBS businesses at strong double-digit growth rates.\nHenry Chien: Yes. Got it. All right. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMario Cortellacci: Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. I just had a question on consulting. I wanted to see if you can give us a sense for what the sales cycle looks like for consulting today versus what it looked like a few months ago? And do you think a vaccine rollout changes that as we enter 2021?\nEugene Hall: Yes. I would say to your point, the consulting selling cycle is longer now. What many companies did is just in response to the downturn of pandemic is just stopped all outside spending, put a pause on it, which obviously increases your selling cycle, and we certainly saw that. I do think as both with the vaccine, but also as companies understand how stable their financial situation is, we will see that selling cycle start to come down a bit both -- from both of those factors.\nMario Cortellacci: Great. And then could you just also talk about how sustainable the -- I'm sorry, the sequential improvement in GBS is? And are you doing anything differently there? Is it a factor of your sales force being more tenured? Are you -- is there anything new in terms of products or is it just simply that things are getting better from an economy standpoint?\nEugene Hall: So GBS, like GTS, has an enormous untapped market opportunity. And we have products that provide great value to capture that market opportunity. That's what's driving the GBS improvement. And I think we're going to continue to see that acceleration over time for the same reason. The clients find a lot of value in the products. I do think that we introduced GxL products. It took time to -- for the sales force to figure out the value proposition expansion clients. And that's part of the reason we're seeing sort of the acceleration more recently. But I think at the heart of it is, drive market opportunity with products that provide tremendous value to our clients.\nMario Cortellacci: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I\u2019m currently showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Gene Hall for closing remarks.\nEugene Hall: So as you heard today, Gartner delivered a strong performance in the context of what was a truly extraordinary year. We continue to have a vast and largely un-penetrated addressable market. The Gartner formula for sustained long-term growth continues to drive success in our research business. And looking ahead, we are well-positioned for sustained success. We will return to revenue growth in 2021. And beyond 2021, over the medium and long-term, we expect to return to sustained double-digit contract value and revenue growth. We expect to deliver EBITDA margins up from 2019 and to further expand margins over time. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we'll deploy to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and to make strategic tuck-in acquisitions. And finally, we expect to come out of this recession strong and well positioned to drive long-term sustained double-digit growth for years to come. Thanks again for joining us, and I look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "Eugene Hall",
            "content": "Good morning and thanks for joining us. 2020 was an extraordinary year. The COVID-19 pandemic, global macroeconomic conditions, social unrest and geopolitical changes all pose significant challenges to enterprises around the world. In this context, Gartner delivered a strong performance across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. As many of you know, we entered 2020 with a financial plan to align costs with revenues. By executing this plan and taking swift cost actions when the pandemic first began, we quickly stabilized our financial position. We maintained disciplined cost management throughout the year over strong investments to support future growth. We successfully pivoted our global workforce to operate effectively in a remote environment. We grew our capability in key functions across our business. We drove strong operational execution and we were extremely agile in serving our clients. Pivoting our content to address critical contemporary issues, such as the pandemic, remote work environments, cost optimization and business continuity. We're well-positioned to spring back quickly as the macroeconomic environment improves. Our performance improved in Q4 compared to earlier in 2020. We delivered strong performances in GTS contract value, research revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow. Research is our largest and most profitable segment. It is a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. Our Research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. We are uniquely positioned to support leaders enterprise wide on hundreds of critically important topics. Topics with the highest interest during Q4 included data and analytics, cost optimization and talent management. Global technology sales or GTS serves leaders and their teams within IT. For the full year 2020, GTS contract value grew 4%. Our key underlying metrics have improved each quarter since Q2. Fourth quarter 2020 contract value from New logos was up from a year-ago, while capsules were about the same. Our existing clients continue to increase their spend, however, it was a slower pace than in 2019. This was the biggest factor impacting our growth in the quarter. Client engagement continue to be strong with both content and analyst interactions up 30% versus 2019. We saw strong performances across several regions and industries, including tech, retail and services. Some of the topics with the highest interest included digital transformation, application development, cloud management and the digital workplace. We expect GTS contract value growth to accelerate in 2021 and return to double-digit growth in the future. Global Business sales or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value continue to perform well throughout the year with contract value growth of 7%. New business growth was a very strong 26% in the quarter driven by our GxL product line. The sales, finance and HR practices all ended Q4 with double-digit growth rates and all practices with the exception of marketing contributed to GBS's growth. Across our entire research business, we've practiced relentless execution of proven practices, and we're seeing the results of our efforts. Our research business is well-positioned to return to sustained double-digit growth over the medium term. Turning to conferences. As many of you know, our Conferences segment had great momentum coming out of 2019. It was hard hit in 2020 by the global pandemic. To replace our traditional in-person destination conferences, which were no longer possible in 2020, we pivoted to virtual conferences. The performance of these conferences exceeded our expectations in 2020. And now with several months experience under our belt, we've got a set of best practices that will continue to refine. Our value proposition for virtual conferences remains the same as for in-person conferences. We deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. Beyond virtual conferences, operationally, we're preparing to return to in-person conferences in the second half of 2021. Gartner consulting is an extension of Gartner Research and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project based work. Our Consulting segment was also impacted by the pandemic with revenues down 12% in Q4, and 5% for the full year 2020. Over the past several years, we've made great progress in our consulting business, and it will continue to serve as an important complement to our IT research business. Company-wide, we continue to strengthen our stance against racism and discrimination. We appointed a new leader of diversity, equity and inclusion. We established a center of excellence dedicated to improvement in this area. And we strengthened our employee resource groups, which helps remove barriers for diverse populations and support associate engagement. Sustainability is an important factor in how we manage our business. For example, we signed contracts for our Stanford headquarters and our U.K hub to be powered by 100% renewable energy. We will be eliminating single use plastics across our offices. And finally, we're benchmarking our environmental footprint and development programs to minimize it over time. Summarizing, we perform well in the context of a pandemic. Looking ahead, we are well-positioned for sustained growth. We expect to return to revenue growth in 2021 and are on track to return to double-digit CV and revenue growth thereafter. We expect to deliver 2021 EBITDA margins up 2019 and to further expand margins over time. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which will deploy to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases, and make strategic tuck in acquisitions. With that, I'll hand the call over to Craig. Craig? Hey, Jeff its Gene. So compared to the last downturn, GTS, in fact the whole company, we took a lot of lessons from the last downturn in terms of operational execution. And we've been better all the way around in terms of operational execution. And so, I think that the -- in terms of every aspect of the business like it looks at new logo growth in Q4, that was very good. Even though, obviously, it's still a tough economic environment out there, et cetera. So I think basically, our operational execution is what that it was during the last downturn. In fact, there's a lot of growth in existing -- go ahead, Jeff. I was just saying that there's a lot of growth in existing enterprise as well. It wasn't quite as much as in 2019, but still significant growth in existing enterprises. Hey, Toni, it's Gene. So we are focused on long-term double-digit growth and headcount growth is an important part of that. And so as we go through '21, we expect to increase our headcount both in GTS and GBS not so much to impact '21, but really so we have the capacity in '22 to make sure we can hit very attractive growth rates in '22. Yes, it's Gene. I think the answer is that the clients and prospects see a lot of value in our offerings. We help -- we identify what their most important initiatives are and how they can execute them better. People have those challenges to address in good times and bad. And what we've seen is that the uptake from prospects and clients with the GBS products are really good, and that's because the value they see in them. Yes, great question. So first, we -- even through the pandemic, we saw pretty good rates of buying -- renewal rates and buying from existing clients even in trouble industries. Not all clients were the same, some clients actually would go from five seats to four seats or something like that. And so we did see some of that. But overall, we saw a pretty good performance there. In terms of win backs, for the ones that did downgrade, and there obviously were some of those. Actually we are going to see win backs. And in fact, in Q4, particularly in December, we saw some win backs from some of the business we lost earlier in the year. As we go through '21, we would expect that to continue. Yes, marketing has a same great value proposition that the other GBS practices have. And as you pointed out, we had some products that we discontinued, which has dragged the overall growth rate down. But if you look at the products that -- if you separate that out, which we did -- we can do internally, obviously, the products -- the new products are quite attractive and are selling well. In terms of whether we've lapped, we've not quite lapped it, but we've got -- we've discontinued most of those products. Some of the clients were in multi-years and some of those multi-years extended into 2021.

            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning. I hope everyone remains safe and well. Fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations headlined by a strong performance in GBS, better-than-planned cost management and outstanding free cash flow generation. As our 2021 guidance highlights, we expect total revenue to increase versus 2020, while also positioning Gartner for return to strong growth. Looking out over the medium term, we continue to expect double-digit CV and revenue growth, modest margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Because we can fund growth investments we have ample capital to return to shareholders and to deploy to strategic tuck in acquisitions when we find the right opportunities. Our Board authorized an additional $300 million for repurchases bringing a total available to around $860 million. Reviewing our year-over-year financial performance for the full year 2020, total contract value increased 4%; total FX mutual revenue was down 3%; FX neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 20%; diluted adjusted EPS was a strong $4.89 and free cash flow was $819 million, up almost 100% from 2019. We did see some timing benefits, which I will discuss a bit later. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, down 8% as reported and 9% FX neutral. Excluding Conferences, our revenues were up 2% year-over-year FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, up more than 580 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $245 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 10% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $1.59 and free cash flow in the quarter was a robust $237 million. Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% on an FX neutral basis. Fourth quarter research contribution margin was 72% benefiting in part from the temporary cost avoidance initiatives we put in place starting in the first quarter of 2020. So contract value grew 4% FX neutral to $3.6 billion at December 31. This was the highest contract value in Gartner history, a notable achievement and a challenging year. For the full year 2020, Research revenues increased by 7% both on a reported and FX neutral basis. The gross contribution margin was 72%, up about 240 basis points from the prior year. Global technology sales contract value at the end of the fourth quarter was $2.9 billion, up almost 4% versus the prior year. The selling environment continued to improve in the fourth quarter, but we are still seeing less upsell with existing clients than normal. Our clients are staying with us, but not adding as much incremental CV as we've historically seen, given the challenging economic environment. Moving forward, we expect win backs and a return to more expansion with existing clients to contribute to growth in 2021, consistent with our experience coming out of the last downturn. By industry, CV growth was led by technology, retail and services. While retention for GTS was 98% for the quarter, down about 600 basis points year-over-year, a majority of our industry group saw retention improved from the third quarter. GTS new business declined 5% versus last year, an improvement from both the second and third quarters. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global business sales contract value was $696 million at the end of the fourth quarter. That's about 20% of our total contract value. CV increased 7% year-over-year. CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. The sales, finance and human resources practices all recorded double-digit CV growth for the year. All practices contributed to the 7% CV growth rate for GPBS with the exception of marketing, which was impacted by discontinued products. That said, our marketing business saw improving retention rates and a return to year-over-year new business growth in the fourth quarter. While retention for GBS was 101% for the quarter, down 43 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 26% over last year, led by very strong growth in HR, finance and legal. As with GTS our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Overall, GBS continue to demonstrate its resilience and strength as we exited 2020. The Conferences segment was materially impacted by the global pandemic as you know. During the year, we pivoted to producing virtual conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver for our clients. We held 13 virtual conferences in the fourth quarter. We also held a number of virtual Evanta meetings, shifting these one day local conferences online due to the pandemic. Conferences revenue for the quarter was $93 million. Contribution margin in the quarter was 78%. Our fast transition to virtual conferences has been positive for the overall business. As we discussed last quarter, virtual conferences offer significant value to our research clients and prospects. And while we've shown that we can run virtual conferences profitably, it is important to recognize the different economics associated with virtual versus in-person conferences. Similar to last quarter I'd highlight two primary differences. First, mix of revenue from attendees and exhibitors has essentially flipped. With the in-person format, approximately two-thirds of revenue comes from exhibitors, and one-third from attendees. In a virtual format, we've seen about two-thirds of revenue come from attendees. Second, the vast majority of our attendee revenue has continued to come from research contract entitlements, as opposed to incremental tickets. I'd also highlight that our fourth quarter destination conferences have historically been our largest, most profitable conferences. In 2020, we held our biggest most highly anticipated conferences of the year in the fourth quarter in a virtual format. For the full year 2020, revenue decreased by 75%, both on a reported and FX neutral basis. Gross contribution margin was 48%, down about 290 basis points from 2019 as we maintain some of our costs of service as well as SG&A despite the lower revenue. We did this to ensure we were in a position to execute our new virtual conferences, and to resume in-person conferences when it is safe and permitted. Lastly, the timing of receiving conference cancellation insurance claims remains uncertain, so we will not record any recoveries in excess of expenses incurred until the receipt of the insurance proceeds. Fourth quarter consulting revenues decreased by 10% year-over-year to $94 million dollars. On an FX neutral basis, revenues declined 12%. Consulting contribution margin was 26% in the fourth quarter, down about 160 basis points versus the prior year quarter due to lower contract optimization revenue, which usually flows through at high margins. Labor based revenues were $73 million, down 10% versus Q4 of last year or 12% on an FX neutral basis. Labor based billable headcount of 730 was down 10%. Utilization was 63%, up about 300 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at December 31 was $100 million, down 14% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. Our backlog provides us with about 4 months of forward revenue coverage. Our contract optimization business was down 9% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter. As we've detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. Full year Consulting revenue is down 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX neutral basis, and its gross contribution margin of 31% was up 68 basis points from 2019. SG&A decreased 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up year-over-year as we restored certain compensation and benefit costs and had significantly less revenue from conferences. For the full year, SG&A decreased 3% on a reported and FX neutral basis. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $245 million, up 13% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 10% FX neutral. As we have seen improvements in the macro environment, we have resumed growth spending and started to restore some of the compensation and benefit programs, which we've put on hold when the pandemic first hit. Fourth quarter EBITDA benefited from several factors. First, we've continued to maintain very strong cost discipline across the company. Second, we had better-than-planned revenue performance in research and conferences, which flowed through with very strong incremental margins. Third, we had planned for an increase in certain costs such as travel, which didn't materialize due to pandemic related shutdowns. And finally, we had been conservative in our implied fourth quarter guidance given the geopolitical uncertainty due in part two the U.S election, rising COVID counts and a still recovering global economy. Depreciation in the quarter was approximately $4.5 million from last year, including expense acceleration from facilities related charges. Amortization was down about $800,000 sequentially. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $26 million flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. The Q4 adjusted tax rate which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 25% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 28.4% in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate for the full year was 21%. Adjusted FPS in Q4 was $1.59. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $4.89. EPS growth for the year was 25%. Note that about $7 million of equity compensation expense, which we normally would have incurred in the fourth quarter has shifted into the first quarter of 2021. That was a benefit to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of about $0.07. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $260 million, compared to $83 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by cost avoidance initiatives, improved collections and timing of tax payments. CapEx for the quarter was $23 million, down 57% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate expansion needs due to the pandemic. We defined free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the quarter was $237 million, which is up about 700% versus the prior year. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 20% on a rolling four quarter basis. continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow was well in excess of GAAP and adjusted net income. Adjusted for timing and one-time benefits, 2020 normalized free cash flow margin is around 13%. We had a fantastic year for free cash flow driven by the resiliency of the business, continued strong collections, disciplined cost and cash management and lower cash taxes and deferrals of certain tax payments. We took a number of actions in 2020 to further strengthen our balance sheet. We had two successful bond offerings and amended and extended our credit facility. We reduced our maturity risk and our annual interest expense will be lower starting in 2021. Our December 31 debt balance was $2 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA is about 2.5x.  At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $713 million of cash. We resumed our share repurchases after pausing earlier in the year, buying back $100 million in stock at an average price of $156 per share. The Board recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $300 million because we have significant capacity for buybacks from cash on hand and expected free cash flow. As of February 8, we have around $860 million available for open market repurchases. We expect the Board will refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. We will deploy excess cash for share repurchases and strategic tuck in acquisitions. Before providing the 2021 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2021. For Research, most of our 2021 revenue is determined by our year end 2020 contract value. As we move through the year we will revisit the Research revenue outlook. For Conferences, our guidance is based on being 100% virtual for the full year. Operationally, we are planning to relaunch in-person one day events in the third quarter and in-person destination conferences starting in September. Our guidance includes fixed costs, primarily people and marketing related to both a full year of virtual and in-person conferences. We've excluded the variable costs, primarily venue related associated with the in-person conferences from our guidance. We've been able to run profitable virtual conferences in 2020 and that is reflected in our 2021 guidance. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. The economics in 2021, even in a partial in-person year, won't be fully back to normal. As we get closer to the go, no go decision point, we will provide additional insight to sizing the incremental revenue and profits. For Consulting revenues the compares get easier as we move through the year. We have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. For expenses, we have planned for the full reinstatement of benefits that were either cancelled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase and certain other benefits. We are also returning to growing our sales forces, with planned quota-bearing headcount growth in the high single digits for both GTS and GBS. We've also planned for several additional programs, including technology investments. The impact of most of these expense restorations or investments impact our P&L starting in the second quarter. As you know, travel expense was close to zero from April through December. Our current plans assume a modest ramp up in travel related expenses over the course of 2021. Most of this ramp is built into the second half of the year. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings. Our guidance for 2021 is as follows. We expect Research revenue of at least $3.815 billion, which is growth of at least 5.9%. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $160 million, which is growth of at least 33%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $390 million, which is growth of at least 3.6%. The result is an outlet for consolidated revenue of at least $4.365 billion, which is growth of 6.5%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $760 million, which is a decline of about 7% and reported margins of at least 17.4%. This is based on conferences running virtual only. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $102 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $4.10. For 2021, we expect free cash flow of at least $630 million. This is before any insurance proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellations. It is also important to note that we've revalued our contract value at current year FX rates which had a modest overall impact. Our 2020 ending contract value at 2021 FX rates is $2.9 billion for GTS and $706 million for GBS. Details were included in the appendix of the earnings supplement. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Finally, we expect to deliver at least $200 million of EBITDA in Q1 of 2021. In summary, despite an unfavorable economic environment, we delivered better-than-planned financial results in 2020. We had outstanding free cash flow and strong EBITDA. We strengthened our balance sheet and move quickly to implement cost avoidance initiatives while still investing for future growth. While there is still uncertainty in the macro outlook, our contract value held up better than in the last downturn. We were able to launch and monetize virtual conferences and virtual Evanta meetings. We will continue with targeted investments and restoration of certain expenses to ensure we are well-positioned to rebound when the economy recovers. As I mentioned at the start of my remarks, looking out over the medium term, we continue to expect double digit CV and revenue growth, modest margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Because we can fund growth investments we have ample capital to return to shareholders through our buyback programs and to deploy to strategic tuck in acquisitions when we find the right opportunities. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? And, Jeff, hey, good morning. It's Craig. The other thing I'd add is while we have increased the penetration since the last downturn, we still look at our penetration as sort of woefully under penetrated. Even in our existing enterprises, we're talking about on average four to six seats generally. And so we continue to believe there's an enormous opportunity to continue to penetrate existing enterprises. Yes. Sure, Jeff. Happy to. And again, I mean, I think part of the challenge we have is, we hope we're in a situation where we're able to run a full in-person scenario in the second half of the year. It may vary depending on regions that opened up earlier than others, or certain restrictions that are in place. And so there's no easy yes or no answer here. The way we sort of think about it is, yes, you're right, we did maintain a team in conferences to be able to return to producing our fantastic in-person events, or conferences rather as soon as we can and that is baked into our base level guidance. Obviously, if we pivot to in-person, we generate a lot more revenue. The way we've thought about it in our modeling is it will flow through at historical incremental margin rates, roughly for conferences. And so if you look back to how our incremental margins flow through historically, that's what we're expecting as we make this pivot. Now the other thing I would mention is, as we do return to in-person and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks as well, we don't expect to fully return to the size and scale that we exited 2019 at. It's going to take a little bit of time to grow back and that obviously impacts the flow through economics as well. Hey, good morning, Toni. Thanks. Thanks for the question. In terms of the monetization, I would say we're still progressing on that, and I wouldn't anchor on that 40%. I think one thing to keep in mind is we did a really great job of very quickly pivoting and a great job of monetizing in the back half of this year. In the last 3 months of the year we ran our Global Symposium Series, which as you know, are typically and historically our largest, most profitable conferences. And we were actually -- we had significant pent up demand, if you will, from not being able to run conferences for the first several months of the year. I think -- so, again, we'll continue to refine our monetization and our ability to market to and sell incremental tickets to those virtual conferences. And so, again, we expect we'll get better and better at this as we move on. In terms of exhibitors, we did a decent job, I would argue, in the fourth quarter. While the revenue mix has shifted, as I mentioned, to being more attendee-driven, still a full third of our revenue was generated from exhibitors in the fourth quarter. And so I think similar to the attendee commentary I just gave you, we continue to get better and better at that as well by providing exhibitors the opportunity to meet with or get exposed to our highly qualified audience. And then on top of that, our attendees generally one of the things that they really put a lot of value on when they come to a conference is that exposure to the exhibitors as well. So I think both are works in process. We've gotten, as Gene mentioned, better and smarter at how we deliver it after each and every conference, and we will continue to refine that as we move forward. And Toni, just on the phasing, I think because of what Gene just mentioned which this is really about seeding the investments for '22 and beyond, you won't necessarily see an inflection point in Q1. Like most of our cost restoration and cost investments, we're really turning these things on from Q2 and beyond. So it really impact the P&L Q2 and beyond. Yes. Good morning, Gary, and thanks for the comments and the question. So I think that, obviously, our business model is one that should generate significant amounts of free cash flow. And when we were in 2017 to 2019 timeframe, we were investing significantly both from operating P&L perspective and also from a CapEx perspective as we were dealing with all the growth. And we had some challenges with our collection pacing and DSOs and things of that nature as well. I think in 2020, we got everything back on track. And so we did a fantastic job on collections in 2020, especially in a really tough environment, which was great. And obviously that flowed through in 2020 and we expect to maintain that level of collection pacing moving forward. The other big factor I would say is CapEx. And so we had a significant amount of investment, as I mentioned, in capital expenditures, primarily behind facilities to support our very significant investment in growth and headcount. Obviously, we muted that in 2020. And our 2021 guidance assumes that we're going to run at roughly the same level of CapEx spending as we had in 2020. And I think moving forward, we can expect that to remain at roughly the levels that we are today, sort of in that percent of revenue range. So it will increase, but we don't see it going back to the roughly $150 million that we spent on it in 2018. So I think the combination of those two things and really getting the benefit of our upfront negative working capital model is what we're seeing flow through, and so we focused on it. We sort of straight from it for a year or two. We got real focus on it again, and we saw the benefits of that in 2020. Obviously, 2020 was sort of an extraordinary year with a lot of unique things in it. But you're right, our 2021 guidance for free cash flow margin, if you will, is even a little bit higher than that normalized rate that we saw in 2020. So we feel really good about the free cash flow generation capability and forecast and outlook moving forward. Yes, I think that's a smart observation. I think as we progress through -- let me back up for a second. So when we entered 2020, our operating plan was essentially, let's make sure 100% that we have revenue growth and cost growth in line and set ourselves up to then be able to modestly expand margins moving forward. I think as we progressed through 2020 with an eye toward cost discipline and cost management, we were able to flex on things that we didn't necessarily think were possible previously. And so I think as we look at our cost savings that we generated and cost avoidance that we generated in 2020, portions of that were permanent and we'll be able to yield the benefits of that moving forward. Portions of them were what I would characterize as semi-permanent will get smarter around the way we spend in the future based on what we learned in 2020, and some of them will come right back, right? So like the benefit stuff that we saved and our compensation and benefit savings in 2020, we're obviously bringing that back in 2021 and we think it's really important from an associate perspective to keep everyone motivated and running toward our goals. But there certainly are things that we definitely see permanent and/or semi-permanent savings from that we learned in 2020 that will be able to help us manage to that better margin outlook moving forward. Good morning, George. So the way to think about it is, we have invested in growing both our GTS and GBS sales forces over the past several years. Obviously, in 2020, we didn't do that. We actually paired down a little bit. We were able to work through a pretty large dense that we had built at the end of 2019. And so we feel really good about our capacity -- our sales capacity, our selling capacity entering 2021. And so we've got a significant amount of sellers in both GTS and GBS ready to go and tackle 2021. And so the way to think about the inflection and what we expect from a CV perspective is that, obviously, Q1 is the last, if you will, tough compare from a semi-normal environment and the compares to get easier in Q2 and beyond. So that's why we expect that inflection point from a CV growth perspective to sort of pivot upwards after Q1. I think there's a variety of different productivity scenarios you can run. If we're able to get back to 2019 levels of productivity, obviously, that would drive a really nice rebound and very significant contract value growth in 2021. But you can also get there getting somewhere in between where we finished 2020 and where we finished 2019. And so as we think about it, we believe that there is no reason why in the future, not necessarily in 2021, in the future, we can't get back to the productivity levels we were at pre-pandemic. It's going to take potentially a little bit of time to get there. But even if we glide up to that level, we can see a pretty nice rebound in the contract value growth for GTS over the course of both 2021 and into 2022. Yes. Good morning, Manav. Happy to. So I think as we mentioned, we have pivoted to virtual in both our destination conference portfolio and in our one day Evanta portfolio. And if you look at Q4 as an example, historically, Evanta contributed about 20% to our overall conferences revenue. It was a little bit higher than that in Q4, but not significantly higher than that. So it's been a pretty consistent contributor. They actually were able to pivot a little sooner to virtual just given the size of the communities and the size of the events or the meetings that they run. And so again, we're very, very pleased with what we've been able to do from a monetization perspective on both Evanta one day meetings and the destination meetings. We do believe as we look at our 2021 calendar that we will be able to return to in-person Evanta meetings, perhaps a little bit sooner, really dependent on the geography and what is allowed or permitted in those geographies. But we do think given the size of them that we'll be able to return to them a little bit earlier. But many event we've focused or we've pivoted to really driving virtual value in absence of in-person value, clearly I think our members and exhibitors in that business are itching to get back to in-person value, but we expect Evanta to continue to be a really nice contributor to the overall conferences portfolio. Hey, Manav -- yes, sure. Of course. I mean, actually TOPO CV was included in Q4 2019. So over the course of Q4 and the first three quarters of this year, it added about 60 basis points to the GBS growth rate. It's actually apples-to-apples in the Q4 numbers, so it didn't -- that's why you don't see any sort of dislocation really between the reported GBS rate and the organic rate given TOPO CV is in both balances."

I would not like to hand the conference over to your speaker today. David Cohen, Gardner's VP of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Cohen: [00:00:42] Good morning, everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for Gardner's third quarter Twenty twenty earnings call and I hope you are well, with me on the call today are Eugene Hall, Chief Executive Officer and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer is called included discussion of third quarter twenty twenty financial results and our updated outlook for twenty twenty as disclosed in today's earnings release. In addition to today's earnings release, they provided a detailed review of our financials and business metrics and earnings supplement for investors and analysts and posted the press release and the earnings supplement on our website. Investor Dot Dotcom following comments by. And we will open up the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to one and a follow up on the call. Unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA. But the gentleman, as described in our earnings release, our growth rates in Gene's comments are neutral unless stated otherwise. Reconciliations for all non gap numbers we use are available in the investor relations section of the Gartner dot com website. Finally, while contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on twenty twenty foreign exchange rates unless stated otherwise, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward looking statements. Forward looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's twenty 19 annual report. Information contained quarterly reports on Form Tinku, as well as in other filings with the SEC. Encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now I will turn the call over to Gardner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nEugene Hall: [00:02:16] Good morning. Welcome to a quarterly earnings call. Thanks for joining us. Business leaders need help in all times, but turn highly uncertain times like today. They need help more than ever. Those they know Gartner know we are the best source for how to survive and thrive in these difficult times. [00:02:34] Beginning in Q1, we made significant changes in response to the pandemic and economic downturn. Our strategy is to ensure our research content addresses the most critical priorities of our clients at any point in time. With the pandemic hit, the rate of change in the world increased dramatically. We responded with the agility. We accelerated the creation of new, highly relevant content for our clients across every function. Topics included adapting to covid-19, shifting to remote work, accelerating the transition to digital business, strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion across the enterprise, and more clients of highly valued this content. Addressing their mission critical priorities. Client engagement with our experts rose significantly. During Q3, client interactions increased more than 20 percent year over year to over one hundred and twenty thousand interactions. Gartner conferences deliver the same unparalleled insights and advice to those who want an immersive experience. So you told her to attend our conferences for free. Great value, which results in higher retention? Nancy toters equally received great value and are a great source of highly qualified leads for research. Salesforce. Once the pandemic hit, we pivoted to virtual conferences to replace our traditional in-person destination conferences. So far, we've delivered seven virtual conferences through October and the performance of these conferences has exceeded our expectations. IT Symposium Expo is our flagship conference series for senior executives. We recently held our IT symposium, America's Virtually. It was a resounding success. More than fifteen thousand executives attended and that's about double the number that attended Orlando Symposium in person last year. Attendees were highly engaged and participated in an average of 11 life sessions. [00:04:27] More than 80 percent of White Symposium Americas attendees at the conference is meeting or exceeding their expectations. Attendees tour for the keynote were on par with the in-person conferences from last year. Exhibitors are also an important element of our conferences. We've been working with them to create a great experience for both attendees and themselves. Exhibit revenues were lower when compared to our in-person conferences from last year. They exceeded our expectations. Early on, there was great uncertainty as to whether virtual conferences would be viable. The results of the seven virtual conferences we've held to date demonstrate we can achieve attendance while delivering high value to both attendees and exhibitors. We're early in the virtual conference jury in each one we felt has been better than the last we're learning organization. We'll continue to get even better by taking the experience from each conference and improving on the next, with eight more virtual conferences planned for twenty twenty and if we already have more than twenty one thousand attendees registered. So we were extremely agile in serving the needs of our clients by adapting our content and pivoting to virtual conferences, we were just as agile in adapting our operations for the new environment. We went from an in office to completely remote and we now have achieved the same level of operational. As we had in the office, we had early indecisively at the beginning of the pandemic to optimize our cost and prepare for a wide range of scenarios. We've achieved strong cost savings by working smarter, not just by getting by with less. For example, we've established specialized teams to handle some tasks, such as background research. [00:06:03] Previously, this was done individually, but all our experts, rather than specialized teams, the specialized teams do this research in fewer hours and often with higher quality because of the specialization. In addition, we have automated some of this work through technology such as web mining, which further lowers the cost increases. The overall quality to these changes didn't begin during the pandemic, but because the pandemic, we accelerated the pace. In addition to cost savings and operational efficiencies, we also took several steps to preserve liquidity and maintain financial strength. We now have a capital structure with less maturity risk and more flexibility. So we accelerated the creation of new, highly relevant content for our clients. Across every function, we successfully pivoted to virtual conferences which were well attended and delivered high value to our clients. Our clients are more engaged than ever beyond client engagement. We adapted our operations to work remotely, just as effectively as we do from our offices, and we combine this with early and decisive actions to optimize our cost structure and our balance sheet. The combination of these factors has resulted in improvements across most of our operational metrics compared to future improvement in our operational metrics. In turn as a result, and improvements in our two three financial metrics and guidance compared to Q2 revenue and EBITDA are performing better than we expected. And free cash flow generation is very strong. To provide more details on our financial performance and increased guidance now, turn the call over to our CFO, Craig Safian.\nCraig Safian: [00:07:33] Thank you, Gene, and good morning. I hope everyone remains safe and well. Third quarter results were ahead of our expectations, and we raised our full year guidance to reflect the modestly better demand environment and strong cost management. We had another successful bond offering during the quarter and amended and extended our credit facility through two thousand twenty five as of September 30th. We have a stronger balance sheet than we did at the start of the year. We have significant liquidity, which gives us financial flexibility. We reduced our maturity risk and our annual interest expense will be lower starting in twenty twenty one. As we've gotten more clarity on the economy engaged our business performance over the past several months, we resumed targeted spending. While we continue to manage our costs carefully, we remain focused on positioning ourselves to rebound strongly as the economy recovers. Third quarter revenue was nine hundred ninety five million dollars, down one percent as reported and neutral. Excluding conferences, our revenues were up five percent year over year. Ethics neutral. In addition, contribution margin was sixty seven percent, up more than 300 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was one hundred and sixty eight dollars million of twenty percent year over year and nineteen percent effective neutral adjusted EPS was ninety one cents and free cash flow in the quarter was a very strong two hundred and twenty nine million dollars. [00:08:50] Research revenue in the third quarter grew six percent year over year on a reported and neutral basis. Third quarter research contribution margin was seventy two percent, benefiting in part from the temporary cost avoidance initiatives we put in place starting in the first quarter. As we have seen improvements in the macro environment, we have resumed growth spending and start to restore some of the compensation and benefit programs which we put on hold. When the pandemic first hit, total contract value was three point four dollars million at September 30th, representing eFax natural growth of five percent versus the prior year. Global technology sales contract value at the end of the third quarter was two point eight dollars billion, up five percent versus the prior year. The more challenging selling environment that began in March continue through the third quarter and had an impact on most of our reported metrics. Client retention for GTS was 80 percent, down about one hundred and sixty basis points year over year, but up modestly from last quarter, while retention for GTS was ninety nine percent for the quarter, down about six hundred basis points year over year. GTS new business declined seven percent versus last year we ended. The third quarter with Enterprise is down about three percent from last year. [00:09:57] The average contract value for enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at two hundred twenty seven thousand dollars for Enterprise, which GTS up nine percent year over year growth and KVI for Enterprise reflects the combination of sales, increased number of subscriptions and price. In addition, we continue to see higher churn among the lower spending clients. At the end of the third quarter, the number of quarter bearing associates and GTS was down about eight percent year over year. We expect to end Twenty twenty with more than thirty one hundred quarter bearing associates, a slight decline from the end of twenty nineteen. We entered this year with a large bench which we have now fully deployed for GTS the year over year and contract value increase or N\u00f6kkvi divided by the beginning period, quota bearing headcount was forty one thousand dollars per salesperson. Down about 60 percent versus the third quarter of last year, despite the challenging macro environment, GCD grew Gruene nearly all of our 10 largest countries and similar to last quarter was up double digits in Brazil, Japan, France and the Netherlands. KVI grew across all sectors except for transportation and media across our entire GTA sales team. We sold significant amounts of new business in the quarter to both existing and new clients. [00:11:08] New logos continue to be a significant contributor to our growth. Finally, despite some returning clients, we continue to see increased spending by retain clients on average, although not quite enough to offset dollar attrition. This speaks to the compelling client value proposition we offer is both strong and challenging economic environments. Overall retention and new business improved in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter global business sales contract volume six hundred fifty six dollars million at the end of the third quarter. That's about 20 percent of our total contract value. KVI growth was six percent year over year as reported, and five percent on an organic basis. KVI growth in the quarter was led by our supply chain and human resources teams. All practices positively contributed to the six percent growth rate for jobs. With the exception of marketing, GBS new business was strong of fourteen percent over last year. As we've discussed the last three quarters and the marketing practice, we are transitioning away from some lower margin products. This has created short term headwinds but is expected to improve profitability in a normal environment. GE Excel is now more than 50 percent of total contract value, an important milestone in the path to long term sustained double digit growth in GBS. Client retention for GBS was eighty two percent, up one hundred seventeen basis points year over year, while retention for GBS was ninety nine percent for the quarter, up 220 basis points year over year. [00:12:33] We ended the third quarter with kvass. Enterprise is down about nine percent from last year. As we continue to see churn of legacy clients, the average contract value for enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at one hundred forty thousand dollars per enterprise and GBS of sixteen percent year over year growth and CV for enterprise reflects also an increased number of subscriptions, penetration of new functional areas and price. Despite the pandemic, our retain clients are continuing to spend more with us every year, although not quite enough to offset attrition. At the end of the third quarter, the number of quarter bearing associates in GBS was down seven percent. Year over year. We expect to end twenty twenty with roughly flat headcount at the end of twenty nineteen in GBS. For GBS, the year over year contract value increase or NCBI divided by the beginning period quarter headcount was thirty eight thousand dollars per salesperson up from last year. Overall, GBS had a good third quarter, driven by a strong double digit year over year improvement in your business. As you know, the conferences segment has been materially impacted by the global pandemic. [00:13:38] We canceled all in person destination conferences for the remainder of Twenty twenty. We pivoted to producing virtual conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver for our clients. We held two virtual conferences in the third quarter after producing pilots in the second quarter. We also held a number of virtual events, meetings, shifting these one day local conferences online. Due to the pandemic conferences, revenue for the quarter was 13 million dollars, a combination of the two virtual conferences and a number of virtual events and meetings. We are still in the early stages of all forms of virtual conferences, and we'll continue to leverage customer feedback as we develop, refine and grow our virtual conference offerings. The revenue mix of our virtual conferences is different from the mix, from in-person conferences. First, in Q3, our revenues were split between virtual conferences and virtual Advanta meetings with a higher mix from event and meetings than last year. Attendees revenue with virtual conferences is from two sources tickets that are purchased as a standalone item either online or for sales teams, or an entitlement associated with a broader research contract. [00:14:44] As we've detailed in the past, a small portion of many research contracts gets attributed to the conferences segment, the vast majority of the two, three and expected to four attendees. Revenue is from subscription contract entitlements. [00:14:57] These are entitlements which would have been applied to in-person conferences and twenty twenty or in some cases in thousand twenty one. We continue to refine our exhibitor offerings for virtual conferences. We expect you for exhibiter revenue to be a much smaller part of overall conferences revenue than in the past. We continue to incur costs both in cost of services and to support virtual conferences and to be in a position to resume in-person conferences when it is safe and permitted. [00:15:24] Lastly, the timing of receiving conference cancelation insurance claims remains uncertain, so we will not record any coverage in expenses incurred until the receipt of the insurance proceeds. Third quarter consulting revenues decreased by four percent year over year to eighty nine million dollars on an annual basis. Revenues declined six percent. Consulting contribution margin was thirty two percent in the third quarter of over 300 basis points versus the prior year quarter margins were up primarily due to cost reduction actions. Labor based revenues were seventy four million dollars, down five percent versus Q3 of last year, or six percent on an annual basis. Labor based global headcount of seven hundred thirty seven was down nine percent. Utilization was sixty percent of about three hundred basis points year over year. Backlog at September 30th was ninety six million dollars, down twelve percent year over year on an annual basis. Our backlog provides us with about four months of forward revenue coverage. As we discussed last quarter, we had a small workforce action consulting business to align our billable headcount with our revenue outlook for the balance of the year. Our contract optimization business was down three percent on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter. This compares to a seventy four percent growth rate in the third quarter last year. As we detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. Stena increased two percent year over year and the third quarter and one percent on an annual basis as Gen\u00e9 as a percentage of revenue increased in the quarter as we restored certain compensation and benefits costs, EBITDA for the third quarter was one hundred and sixty eight dollars million of twenty percent year over year on a reported basis and a nineteen percent effective neutral. [00:17:04] As I mentioned earlier, we had stronger than expected topline performance and continue our disciplined focus on expenses. We also continue to see a meaningful benefit from significantly lower than normal travel costs. Depreciation in the quarter was up approximately two million dollars from last year, although flat with second quarter as a result of additional office space that had gone into service before the pandemic. IT amortization was about flat sequentially. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was twenty nine million dollars, up from twenty two million dollars in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. Net interest expense is up because our interest rate swaps at higher fixed rates in the warrants which expired last year. The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was twenty percent for the quarter tax rate for the items used to adjust. That income was twenty six point four percent in the quarter. Adjusted EPS one, two, three was ninety one cents. Operating cash flow for the quarter was two hundred forty four million dollars, compared to two hundred twenty million dollars last year. [00:18:04] The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by cost avoidance initiatives, partially offset by an earlier interest payment due to the refinancing capex for the quarter was 15 million dollars now. Fifty nine percent year over year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate expansion needs due to the pandemic. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities. Less capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the quarter was two hundred twenty nine dollars million, which is up twenty five percent versus the prior year. This includes outflows of about 10 million dollars of acquisition, integration and other non-recurring items. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 15 percent on a rolling four quarter basis. Continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years, free cash flow as a percent of net income was about two hundred eighty five percent. Free cash flow benefited from continued strong collections, combined with reductions in outflows from our cost avoidance initiatives, lower capital expenditures and lower cash taxes and deferrals of certain tax payments. While we've seen timing benefits to our free cash flow margin from significantly lower capex and our ability to defer certain tax payments, even excluding these LTM free cash flow margin is still up about 200 basis points versus the prior year. [00:19:18] During the quarter, we took advantage of historically attractive high yield bond pricing and issued eight hundred million dollars of new 10 year senior unsecured notes with a three point seventy five percent coupon. We use the proceeds from this new issuance to extinguish our two thousand twenty five bonds, which carry a five and an eight percent coupon. We also amended and extended our credit facility to September twenty twenty five with attractive financial terms, increased flexibility and fewer less restrictive covenants. The overall impact of the financing activities resulted in a 50 basis point reduction to total cost of borrowing. The combination of the capital markets activities in the past six months has extended our debt maturity profile to nearly eight years versus less than three years pre pandemic or September 30th. [00:20:01] That balance was two billion dollars. Our reported gross debt, trailing 12 month EBITDA is about two point five times our total modified net debt covenant. Leverage ratio was two point three times at the end of the third quarter, well within the five times covenant limit. At the end of the third quarter, we had five hundred and fifty four million dollars of cash. After pausing share repurchases at the start of the pandemic, we are in a position to resume our normal capital allocation programs. [00:20:28] Going forward, we will deploy excess cash for share repurchases and strategic tuck in acquisitions. At the end of the quarter, we had about one billion dollars of revolver capacity and have around six hundred and eighty million dollars. With meeting on our share repurchase authorization, we are updating our full year outlook to reflect Jeoffrey performance, a modestly better demand environment, including the successful launch of virtual conferences and cost restoration plans last quarter. When updating guidance, we were cautious because we had only been through one full quarter of the pandemic and we had two quarters remaining in the year with more experience, better performance and more visibility. You've updated our guidance. Accordingly, we now forecast research revenue of at least three point fifty seven dollars billion for the full year. This is growth of almost six percent versus twenty nineteen and reflects a continuation of third quarter new business and retention trends for the conferences segment. We are generating revenue from our virtual conferences. We now expect revenue one hundred and ten million dollars for the full year. This reflects our initial success in launching virtual conferences and virtual events meetings. The majority of the incremental revenue we expect in conferences is from entitlements included in some of our subscription contracts. As we discussed earlier, we now forecast consulting revenue of at least three hundred and seventy million dollars for the full year, or decline of about six percent. [00:21:47] The consulting outlook continues to contemplate a slowdown in labor based demand. The timing of revenue in the contract optimization business can be highly variable. As you know, overall, we expect consolidated revenue of at least four point zero five billion dollars. That's reported decline of about five percent versus twenty nineteen. Excluding conferences, we expect revenue growth of at least four point five percent versus twenty eighteen on a reported basis. The cost avoidance programs we put in place in March have allowed us to protect profitability and conserve cash. We started to resume certain spending late in the second quarter. As the operating environment appears to have at least stabilized. We want to ensure we are well positioned for an economic normalization. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least seven hundred forty million dollars. That's full year margins of about eighteen point three percent, up from sixteen point one percent margins we had in twenty eighteen. We expect a full year twenty twenty net interest expense to be one hundred and six million dollars. We continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of around twenty two percent for Twenty twenty. [00:22:48] This doesn't apply a higher fourth quarter rate than we've seen throughout twenty twenty consistent with our experience in recent years, we expect twenty twenty adjusted EPS of at least four dollars and seven cents for Twenty twenty. We expect free cash flow of at least six hundred twenty five million dollars. Our free cash flow guidance reflects both the outlook we just discussed strong capex management and better than previously forecasted collections, all the details of our full year guidance are included on our investor relations site. In summary, despite a very uncertain economic environment, we delivered better than planned financial results in the third quarter, which has allowed us to update our full year outlook favorably. Most of our key operating metrics improved in the quarter, and we were able to successfully launch and monetize virtual conferences in virtual events and meetings. Cash flow was outstanding and we have taken a number of measures to increase our financial flexibility, reduce maturity risk and ensure we have ample liquidity. We will continue to balance cost avoidance programs with targeted investments and restoration of certain expenses to ensure we are well-positioned to rebound when the economy recovers. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator.\nOperator: [00:24:00] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, to ask a question, you want me to press star one on your telephone to withdraw your question, press the banking system by which we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Miller from Baird. Your line is now open.\nJeffrey Meuler: [00:24:19] Yeah, thank you. Good morning. So I always find your sales productivity metric Nixey per beginning a little bit challenging during periods of a lot of acceleration or deceleration. One of the things that jumped out to me today was the year over year trends in new business. So relative to the year over year, trends in sales headcount for each of the segments, curious if you use that as an internal metric and then just what you kind of say above that trend and anything in how you're managing sales headcount between the zero CV folks and the people that have a book of existing business. Better understand that. Thanks.\nEugene Hall: [00:25:01] Asia-pac Jean, first, we definitely look at new business for salesperson as one of our key metrics, you know, of the day, the reason we look at MiFi for salesperson is because that would that would net result in growth. But we manage the pieces of it, which are retention of our clients. And the new business is we absolutely manage the business per salesperson. [00:25:22] And the trend there has been has improved significantly between Q2 and Q3 as the numbers you saw from Craig and anything you'd say in terms of how you're managing headcount, in terms of the zero contract value associates and those that have a book of business, like, are there any big shifts occurring among those? [00:25:44] So it varies depending on the specific market and we tailor to the market. And so in markets where we have not that much contract volume because it's relatively immature market, we have more business developers, people that have zero contract value accounts than in a much more mature market like the United States for, you know, especially for GTS, for jobs across the board. We have a lot more business developers because those markets are so relatively under penetrated. So you don't need as many people that are what we call account managers that have existing clients just because the business is so much smaller in each of the disciplines.\nJeffrey Meuler: [00:26:23] And then anything else you can say about what avoided costs are still left to be brought back? And in the past, you made some comments about expecting twenty one margins to be down year over year. Do you still expect them to be down relative to the implied margins from the prior guidance, or are we now using the baseline of this eighteen point one percent or three percent margin this year to be down from a similar question on free cash flow? Obviously, as you said, outstanding this year. Should that step back next year? Thanks.\nEugene Hall: [00:26:59] So let me just started again. Correct. And fill in. So, you know, prior to 20, we were going through an investment period. We were investing really to position GBS to have a great future growth. And we entered that investment period in twenty nineteen. We came into twenty twenty before the pandemic even hit, focused on improving our margins over time. And part of the reason margins are better in twenty twenty to twenty nineteen are is that we were already focusing on how do we get the return on the investments that we put in place over the previous three years. We're still going to focus on that going to the future. Having said that, there are some expenses in Twenty twenty that are lower than they might be in a normal year. And obvious example, my minus travel expenses, where we basically have very low travel expenses compared to a normal year. And I can imagine in once the pandemic is over, we can probably see in our travel expenses will be, I wouldn't say go back to where it was before I thing. We've learned how to work more efficiently, but it would be larger than it would be in a year like Twenty twenty and going on if you want to fill in.\nCraig Safian: [00:28:06] Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. You know, the only two things I would add are that, you know, in terms of the cost avoidance, you know, we were very aggressive in the early days of the pandemic when we really didn't know what the outcome was going to look like. As we stabilized, we obviously started turning certain expenses back on, particularly related to compensation and benefits expenses for our associates, as well as backfilling ogen roles and actually shrinking, sparkling in a little bit of headcount growth in GTS and GBS sales forces. And so, you know, we were first focused on just making sure that we could preserve profitability. And then once we we had aligned to that or I said to that, we we started selectively turning certain expenses back on to Jean's point, Twenty twenty is hardly a normal year by any definition. And so, you know, the way we've been managing the business and again, we have been restoring a lot of costs in the back half of the year and we were able to get virtual conferences launched and monetized. That's obviously playing a large role in in the margin profile for for for Twenty twenty. You know, as we look forward, the way we sort of think about it from a medium term perspective is that we can absolutely drive double digit top line growth and modestly expand margins over at least the medium term. [00:29:46] We will expand margins from the twenty nineteen levels, which is our last normal year benchmark, if you will. And to the point he made, we are very committed to maintaining tight cost. Trolls like you've seen from us this year, we will have to turn certain things back on, but things like travel, we will have to travel more. We will have more expense there, but it will probably not run all the way back up to what we did in twenty nineteen. Similarly with facilities, you know, we've obviously had a lot of operational benefits this year from not having to heat and cool and run facilities as we've been working from home. Hopefully we will be back into service at some point and those expenses will come back. Although I will say that as we go forward, we probably won't need to expand our facilities footprint at the same pace that we did in the past. And so there's a lot of moving parts there. [00:30:45] But I think the key point is that over the medium term, we believe that we can drive double digit top line growth and modestly expand our margins.\nJeffrey Meuler: [00:30:56] Thank you, Bob.\nOperator: [00:31:00] Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nToni Kaplan: [00:31:07] That's great. Thank you, Jeanne, you mentioned that a higher demand that you're seeing from clients who just dove a little bit more into that within research which regions have been strong, and basically when regions have either somewhat recovered from covid and start to open up, I'm thinking maybe China or even in the U.S. over the summer when when things were a little bit better, you know, how quickly can the business rebound or should we be viewing this more as a slow recovery? I just want to get some color on the strengthening demand that you mentioned. Thanks.\nEugene Hall: [00:31:47] Hi, Tony. I don't know I don't know how fast the pace of recovery will be, but we certainly saw meaningful improvements between, you know, Q2 and Q3 in terms of demand as the numbers that went through in terms of like new business and so forth. If you look at China, China is interesting because they have recovered relatively quickly, like the you know, the new business growth in most of Japan and China in China has been quite good in Japan. Same thing, actually. And so if the rest of the world kind of goes the way of China and Japan, then we'll have a relatively quick recovery for us.\nToni Kaplan: [00:32:26] That's great. And I wanted to ask also about the hiring strategy that Fred mentioned, the 30 100 expected by year end. In general, I guess, are you thinking about hiring a head of CV growth, turning around or in a little bit more of a wait and see kind of pattern? Just trying to understand on this strategy of hiring through the rest of the year and maybe through next year in terms of how you're thinking about it.\nCraig Safian: [00:33:00] Yeah, Gruner, Salesforce is an important part of our growth strategy. And so over time, we expect to grow our sales force in kind of in line with our contract volume growth. And so that's kind of the long term strategy we came into this year. So at the end of last year, we added a substantial amount of headcount as we came into this year for to allow our growth during Twenty twenty. Now, obviously, the pandemic is that we haven't realized that gross. We actually have a lot of sales capacity that we think as the market improves, will give us a good uplift and then we're going to use that leverage that will also then grow our sales headcount. Do you think about in line with KB as we go forward to support future growth?\nEugene Hall: [00:33:40] One of the things I tell you is if you just think about the capacity we've invested in building over the last several years in both GTS and GBS is pretty substantial. And so with that selling capacity, again, if we can approach 2019 productivity levels or core back half the gap between where we are today and 2019 productivity levels, we could actually drive really nice CV growth just from that capacity. And as Jim mentioned, our strategy because of the market opportunity we have is to continue to grow the sales force, which we will do to grow, capture that opportunity. But again, we always look at the two levers to drive massive growth over the medium term or long term. It's growing sales headcount to capture the market opportunity and driving productivity improvements at the same time.\nToni Kaplan: [00:34:35] Thanks so much.\nOperator: [00:34:39] Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nGary Bisbee: [00:34:47] Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess I want to start by asking about the GB's contract value growth and, you know, new bookings, really no deceleration sequentially in the bookings were strong. Can you give us any more any more color on sort of what the key drivers are of where you really succeeding? And I know you didn't give the GSL breakout anymore, as you said you wouldn't. But, you know, if you when you look at those metrics, are you sort of past that inflection point where the vehicle is meaningfully enough, bigger that that's really, you know, the key driver for their growth that you're seeing.\nEugene Hall: [00:35:29] The Jekyll's clearly the key driver in DBS going forward. We think we cross the threshold of 10000 seats in GBS, which initially was a major, major milestone. The Geeveston business is being driven by the fact that, you know, what we talked about all along, basically in each of the functions around the business, the executives have mission-critical priorities they need help with and they see Gartner's people to help them in. Our sales were extremely effective at reaching out to prospects, explained how we can help and the prospects of responding. And that's fundamentally what's driving the new business growth. And in fact, the it's really we're seeing the benefit of it now, even with the pandemic. But we talked with earlier the investments we made over the last two or three years before Twenty twenty, it's really starting to get the power from all those investments in GBS.\nCraig Safian: [00:36:20] And Gary, good morning. I would just add, you know, as I mentioned in my remarks just now, GSL now represents more than 50 percent of the contract value within GBS. So it really is a story going forward that is the predominant amount of contract value within the portfolio. And then the other nice thing I would add is that we're seeing really good contribution across the across the GBS practice portfolio. So it's not just a supply chain or it's not just the HRR. We're seeing a really good contribution in finance, in HRR, in supply chain and sales, et cetera. And so that it's not just one story, that it's across the portfolio.\nGary Bisbee: [00:37:06] And just as a follow up, if I can dig into a tiny bit more, you know, do you have is there any way to tell how much of the improvement there in the in the TV holding up quite well is sort of easy comps because you pushed so much change in over the last couple of years. So it's sort of the maturity of the sales force and and improved productivity. Is there more used to selling to yourself versus in market dynamics? And really what I'm trying to get at is that are those two factors strong enough to continue to, you know, continue to drive outperformance if if the economic environment does remain, you know, weak and choppy in the near term? Thank you.\nCraig Safian: [00:37:49] Yeah, I'll start again if I if I may say. Can you fill in the blanks? No, I think that if you look back at the GBS performance, we really started to see a nice acceleration in the business in Q3 of last year. And so it's not the easiest compare we've had for sure. Know, I think there's definitely a benefit to having a more tenured sales force and having them have significant experience with selling the standard set of products we have. And so that is absolutely a benefit. But I really do believe and I echo what you said earlier, it's really about the value we're providing to the end users in each of these markets as opposed to an easy comp or more experience. And so those things help. But I think ultimately it's because we we provide a great value and help business leaders across each of those enterprise functions really solve and win on their mission critical priorities.\nEugene Hall: [00:38:53] And the idea is that the we also it took a while to roll out all the jerko products and then the sales teams had to learn how to sell those products. And so I think they're now getting to the good part of that curve.\nOperator: [00:39:12] Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Nicholas: [00:39:18] Hi, good morning. With a few more months under your belt and what I thought was a solid third quarter result, do you feel like you have a better sense for perhaps TV might trend over the next couple of quarters? And is there any change to how you're thinking about the potential trough in TV growth across both GTS and GBS, both in terms of timing and in magnitude?\nEugene Hall: [00:39:44] Good morning, Andrew. You know, with KVI being a rolling four quarter metric, we do still expect some deceleration in the contract value growth rate probably over the next quarter or two, predominantly because it's going up against a tough compare quarter and fourth quarter of last year. So if you look back at the fourth quarter of last year, you know, we've got significant growth and KVI in both teams and gas. And given the environment, our current estimate and extrapolating what we've seen in Q3 and March through the end of Q2 as well, we do not expect as much new business or similar renewal rates. And so we do expect some continued deceleration in the trough. As you think about it, just based on on on looking at it that way is probably Q1 of of next year. Again, we could outrun that if the economy improves significantly or if there is a vaccine and people go back to the office and everything like that. But we still remain cautious and are using really our last three months performance as a guide as we think about what Steve can do and and how we're building operational plans for the end of this year and for next year.\nAndrew Nicholas: [00:41:14] Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just wanted to switch over to conferences. If I look at guidance or implied guidance for Q4, looks like you're going to about 80, 85 million of conference revenue versus about 218 or somewhere around there last year. If I do the math there, it looks like about 40 percent or so. I know there's two conferences versus last year, but I guess I'm just wondering, is that 40 percent number a reasonable ratio for us to use? And we're thinking about revenue for Twenty twenty one in the instance that that in-person conferences haven't returned? Or are there other factors that I'm not not thinking about that that I should.\nEugene Hall: [00:42:00] Yeah, it's hard it's hard to say, Andrew, predominantly because, you know, we have moved a number of conferences that we would have produced in person earlier in the year into the fourth quarter. And so we've obviously trimmed the portfolio and we've gone with a series of very important, very impactful conferences globally. And in addition, if you look at the Q4 implied guide, you have to also keep in mind that there's a hunk of event virtual meetings in there as well, which are pretty nice contributor to the to the overall number. You know, I think that as we roll into we're in the process of building out twenty, twenty one plans under a number of scenarios for four for next year. As Jean mentioned and I mentioned as well, we're getting better and smarter with each virtual conference that we actually deliver. And the next one gets better and better and better. And we're we're still really working on that exhibiter value proposition as well. [00:43:12] As I mentioned, you know, we expect exhibitor contribution in the fourth quarter to be significantly lower than what you would see historically. And obviously, we want to work really hard to improve that and deliver value to both our attendees from being exposed to the exhibitors and the exhibitors who get the corresponding value. So I wouldn't plug in a formula of 40 percent yet. We're still working through all those scenarios. And again, there are a number of different scenarios where we could be in person later in year, virtual beginning. There could be virtual all year long. You know, when we when we guide for for Twenty twenty one in February, we'll be very clear about what our assumptions include and will really be driven by what the environment allows us to do.\nAndrew Nicholas: [00:44:02] Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: [00:44:06] Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jess Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJeffrey Silber: [00:44:14] Thanks so much. In your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the portion of the growth in both the PBS and GTZ was pricing related. I'm just curious what kind of price increases have been able to put through in terms of renewals and if there's been pressure or pushback from clients on that. Thanks.\nEugene Hall: [00:44:35] Hey, good morning, Jeff. So we for most of our most of the world we do are price increase in November. Actually, yesterday, the first day of November, as we went through the renewal cycle leading up to this November, obviously we were dealing with our our standard price increase. You know, in this environment, there was probably there's definitely a little bit more pushback than we historically say are our price increase. As you know, Ranges has ranged in the three to four percent range historically, and it's typically not big dollars for the client. And we are always improving our products and our experience this year, given the environment, we were a little more modest on the price increase going around, you know, between two and a half to three percent price increase again, which just went into effect. Now, you know, we generally our clients understand that we are improving the product each and every year. The people that deliver the service, their costs go up every year. And so, generally speaking, we haven't seen a ton of pushback on the pricing. But definitely in this environment, it's a little more challenging than what we normally see. But generally speaking, it's modest dollars that we're pushing through look great.\nJeffrey Silber: [00:46:04] That's helpful. If I could shift over to conferences in terms of the shift to hurtful, I'm just also wondering from a price perspective, what do you charge attendees relative to the in-person conference? I know there's some entitlements there and the same thing on the exhibiter side. I'm just curious on a relative basis what the delta. Thanks.\nEugene Hall: [00:46:25] If if you if you take a look at the you can see list pricing online, the pricing is about 40 percent of what we would get from an in-person conference ticket. So think about it in roughly that range in terms of the you know, if you're buying a cash ticket as a standalone item, again, either online or through one of our sales teams on the exhibiter side, as we've mentioned, it's still really early days and we're working through all that. And so there's really not an apples to apples comparison from an exhibitor perspective.\nJeffrey Silber: [00:47:07] Ok, thanks for the call.\nOperator: [00:47:12] Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Berkeley. Your line is now open.\nManav Patnaik: [00:47:20] Thank you. Good morning. I was just hoping you could call it a maybe sticking to the plan, all in reaction to the Wal-Mart detention and the phone call about how much of that is in a number of seats being culpable for this to be a crime. And I knew we were going to see if you anticipate any problems, though.\nManav Patnaik: [00:47:52] I just started with it. So first, the biggest change in the world, children, was the our existing clients are buying fewer additional seats. And so it's actually less that people are reducing seats than it is in normal times. A substantial portion of growth comes from existing clients adding more seats. We see existing clients and particularly adding fewer seats, and they are still in seats with fewer seats than they would do in a normal year. And that's the biggest piece of the water retention rate. What do you think of that?\nCraig Safian: [00:48:29] No, I think that's right again. And it's a combination and go into detail of this last quarter in Q2 and actually, you know, we rolled into Q3. Each of these measures actually improved. And so, you know, the point on fewer clients increasing or increasing at a lower rate, that trend continued into Q3, but it was definitely better than what we experienced in Q2. And the same could be said around clients that were reducing their spend. So we still saw that same happen in Q3, but it was much less pronounced than what we experienced in Q2.\nManav Patnaik: [00:49:13] And just on the events side, would you be willing to share what the advance to the Ground Zero expectation when we call that a big chunk of fourth quarter?\nCraig Safian: [00:49:27] Yeah, I mean, historically, if you go back to the last normal year, we had eventa revenues were in the roughly 15 percent of total revenue range this year. Given what's happening, they're running closer to around a quarter of the conference revenue, just to put it in in rough perspective.\nOperator: [00:49:55] Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tom from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Tong: [00:50:02] Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to drill into the demand environment, which you noted is stronger than you previously expected. Can you elaborate on which specific client segments you're seeing, the upside in gas and jobs and what specific macro or shutdown assumptions are embedded in your full year guidance?\nEugene Hall: [00:50:21] So you've started on it, mentioned in his remarks that in GTA seed grew and nearly all of our 10 largest countries was up double digits in Brazil, Japan, France and the Netherlands. And KVI grew across all sectors except for transportation and media, and it grew across every size enterprise. And so that kind of gives you a flavor for for GTA in GBS, we found we had growth, basically contributions from all the practice areas, meaning like H.R., Supply-Chain, sales, et cetera, except marketing. [00:50:55] As Craig mentioned his remarks, the marketing piece, we have some products that were just continuing which pulled that piece down, but the rest is quite strong.\nCraig Safian: [00:51:04] And George, you know, in terms of the outlook, you know, it's been choppy all along. It varies by region and geography in terms of lockdown's and relock downs and and things of that nature. [00:51:22] And so, you know, we've the good news for for a business like ours is the hunk of the revenue on the research line is is baked based on where we finished Q3. [00:51:37] And so, you know, the guy doesn't really doesn't get impacted all that significantly from whether, you know, there are new lockdown's or otherwise. Obviously, you know, it could have an impact on next year. But I think our sales teams are really focused on working through this. They've proven they can work through it in a lockdown or non lockdown environment. And we'll just continue working through the the selling cycles and renewal cycles as we close the year to the book as much and KVI and as much contract value growth is as possible.\nEugene Hall: [00:52:11] With regard to Lockdown's, we've you know, with our sales teams, we've had a discussion on what impact does it have, like in certain European countries. Now they're going back to Stronger Lockdown's. At least our sales team's perspective on it is that both we and our clients have learned to work in a lockdown environment and they don't anticipate the increased lockdowns you're seeing like in Europe having an impact on our bookings. So time will tell. But that's the sales change perspective.\nGeorge Tong: [00:52:38] That's helpful. You're going to have full year EBITDA margins of slightly over 18 percent. That's up from 16 percent last year. Can you discuss how incremental margins may trend over the next two to four quarters as some of your costs, like TTN sales force hiring, come back?\nCraig Safian: [00:52:57] Yeah, it's a lot of it will be dependent on where we finish this year from a contract value growth perspective. And that has a pretty material or very material impact on the revenue run out for four for next year. You know, we have started to restore a lot of expenses related to compensation and benefits which continue to run consistently. And so there won't be a hurt or should be significant one time hurt when we put those those back on know, I think, you know, we'll obviously provide full color on on Twenty twenty one guidance in February when when when we get there. But for now, you know, we're just really focused on making sure that we we finish the year strong. You know, obviously, we have been able to take up our guidance on just about every count, you know, pretty, pretty nicely. And teams are just focused on making sure we finish the year strong and we'll we'll address what the internal margins look like and what the overall outlook looks like in February in Georgia.\nEugene Hall: [00:54:12] I'd add that, you know, we made a bunch of investments coming into twenty twenty and, you know, sort of the 17, 18, 19 period and 19 margins reflected that we came into at Twenty twenty focused on getting a return on those investments and having tight cost controls. And we expect to keep getting return on those investments over the next few years, as I mentioned earlier. And we intend to keep a tight cost controls as well. And so we're very focused on managing our margins in future years as well.\nGeorge Tong: [00:54:43] Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: [00:54:47] Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nHamzah Mazari: [00:54:54] Hey, good morning. My my first question is just on sales force productivity. Maybe if you could just talk about, you know, getting back to 2019 levels on productivity, what what sort of under your control, what's what's not under your control and what kind of timeframe is realistic to get there? I know you're talked about KVI crossing in Q1, so maybe you could just give you best guess. And, you know, one sales force productivity across.\nCraig Safian: [00:55:26] So it's hard to forecast exactly when sales first person is going to drop as we come to to the call. We've certainly seen this year between Q2 and Q3 and improving all the kind of underlying all the underlying operational metrics that drive sales productivity. I talked about one of them, one client engagement, which ultimately drives retention and new business performed better than in Q3 than in Q2. And so those are things that are going to kind of drive it over time. I think we are learning how to sell in the pandemic has a factor. And so that will continue to get better. They also obviously, the more companies that go out of business and can't buy our products because of business, that has an impact on our productivity as well. So it's those kinds of factors.\nEugene Hall: [00:56:11] And as I would just add that, you know, it's going to really correlate very, very tightly to CV growth. And so, you know, again, it's sort of an output of CV growth or, you know, if you're running back the other way and input into the overall CV growth. But given that we have gotten disciplined, much more disciplined around the headcount growth and headcount vestments and Jean's point, getting yield on those investments and that we'll start having quote unquote easier compares in Q2, you know, the CV growth trough and the productivity growth trough should be on guard at very helpful.\nHamzah Mazari: [00:56:54] And just my follow up question is just two quick ones. One is the territory optimization kind of kind of behind you was sort of an ongoing process. And then just on the research side, anything to call out on the non subscription piece, how that trended? I know it's small at 10 percent or so of research, but just on those two points, anything to Asia-Pac. Thanks so much.\nEugene Hall: [00:57:21] Yeah, the church randomization is really important to us because different territories have different structural characteristics that make them better or worse, a kind of simple and it varies over time. A simple example is a territory selling to restaurants in this state today doesn't have as much upside potential as a territory selling to tech companies. And so we real time shift our territories around to the territories that are away from the ones that are potentially the ones that have a lot of more potential. So it's not a one time thing if we just implemented kind of the most sophisticated versions of our church we're planning this year. And it's something we're going into an ongoing basis as the economy around us changes. And it's an important driver of sales productivity.\nCraig Safian: [00:58:06] And then on the non subspecialties, the it's actually holding up pretty well. It was down three percent year over year in the quarter, which is better than we had initially forecasted. So the answer to your point, relatively small things, but it's holding up better than we had initially thought, down three percent year over year.\nHamzah Mazari: [00:58:28] Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [00:58:32] Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Williams from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nJake Williams: [00:58:38] Thank you and good morning, everyone. Can you share some of the lessons that you've learned from hosting virtual conferences so far? And if you think there are any opportunities to expand the reach or the breadth of future conferences through a hybrid, in-person virtual model.\nEugene Hall: [00:59:01] Hey, Jeanne, so we've heard a lot of lessons, personal conferences, as Craig mentioned, we started with some pilots in Q2 and then have held our our virtual equivalents that were large of our larger conferences this year. Same thing is true, actually, of the events of conferences in the past, were in person, in person, and now are all virtual. And we've learned things about like what technologies to use. Some technologies work better than others. And each time we have, you know, things didn't work as well as we planned, we fix those technology problems. We've been experiment with things like how long each session should be, you know, because in a virtual environment, people on different session lengths. We experimented with how long the conference itself should be. Should it be two days, four days for the for the longer conferences and getting customer feedback or tweaking the length of the conferences. The content is pretty much the same and production values are very similar if you go to any of our conferences. And that has worked pretty well. So those are kind of the key learnings, I'd say. And in terms of opportunity, expand. You know, the way we're looking at it is if there's demand going forward, when in person conferences return, if there's still demand for personal promises, we're going to be really well positioned to do that. And we will certainly do it if demand is there. And my what I believe is demand will be there, but we're going to be flexible based on what the market says.\nJake Williams: [01:00:22] Thank you very much.\nOperator: [01:00:26] Thank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Paul for closing remarks.\nEugene Hall: [01:00:35] So summarize what you heard in today's call. We accelerated the creation of new, highly relevant content for our clients. Across every function, we successfully pivoted to virtual conferences which were well attended and delivered high value to our clients. Our clients are more engaged than ever. The client engagement. We adapted our operations to work remotely, just effectively, as we did from our offices, and we combined this early, decisive actions to optimize our cost structure. The combination of these factors has resulted in improvements across most of our operational metrics compared to the improvement in our operational metrics. In turn, has resulted improvement in our Q3 financial metrics and guidance compared to Q2 revenue and even performed better than we expected in free cash flow generation is very strong. Thanks for joining us and I look forward to updating you again later in the New Year. [01:01:24] Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now just.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eugene Hall",
            "content": "[00:02:16] Good morning. Welcome to a quarterly earnings call. Thanks for joining us. Business leaders need help in all times, but turn highly uncertain times like today. They need help more than ever. Those they know Gartner know we are the best source for how to survive and thrive in these difficult times. [00:02:34] Beginning in Q1, we made significant changes in response to the pandemic and economic downturn. Our strategy is to ensure our research content addresses the most critical priorities of our clients at any point in time. With the pandemic hit, the rate of change in the world increased dramatically. We responded with the agility. We accelerated the creation of new, highly relevant content for our clients across every function. Topics included adapting to covid-19, shifting to remote work, accelerating the transition to digital business, strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion across the enterprise, and more clients of highly valued this content. Addressing their mission critical priorities. Client engagement with our experts rose significantly. During Q3, client interactions increased more than 20 percent year over year to over one hundred and twenty thousand interactions. Gartner conferences deliver the same unparalleled insights and advice to those who want an immersive experience. So you told her to attend our conferences for free. Great value, which results in higher retention? Nancy toters equally received great value and are a great source of highly qualified leads for research. Salesforce. Once the pandemic hit, we pivoted to virtual conferences to replace our traditional in-person destination conferences. So far, we've delivered seven virtual conferences through October and the performance of these conferences has exceeded our expectations. IT Symposium Expo is our flagship conference series for senior executives. We recently held our IT symposium, America's Virtually. It was a resounding success. More than fifteen thousand executives attended and that's about double the number that attended Orlando Symposium in person last year. Attendees were highly engaged and participated in an average of 11 life sessions. [00:04:27] More than 80 percent of White Symposium Americas attendees at the conference is meeting or exceeding their expectations. Attendees tour for the keynote were on par with the in-person conferences from last year. Exhibitors are also an important element of our conferences. We've been working with them to create a great experience for both attendees and themselves. Exhibit revenues were lower when compared to our in-person conferences from last year. They exceeded our expectations. Early on, there was great uncertainty as to whether virtual conferences would be viable. The results of the seven virtual conferences we've held to date demonstrate we can achieve attendance while delivering high value to both attendees and exhibitors. We're early in the virtual conference jury in each one we felt has been better than the last we're learning organization. We'll continue to get even better by taking the experience from each conference and improving on the next, with eight more virtual conferences planned for twenty twenty and if we already have more than twenty one thousand attendees registered. So we were extremely agile in serving the needs of our clients by adapting our content and pivoting to virtual conferences, we were just as agile in adapting our operations for the new environment. We went from an in office to completely remote and we now have achieved the same level of operational. As we had in the office, we had early indecisively at the beginning of the pandemic to optimize our cost and prepare for a wide range of scenarios. We've achieved strong cost savings by working smarter, not just by getting by with less. For example, we've established specialized teams to handle some tasks, such as background research. [00:06:03] Previously, this was done individually, but all our experts, rather than specialized teams, the specialized teams do this research in fewer hours and often with higher quality because of the specialization. In addition, we have automated some of this work through technology such as web mining, which further lowers the cost increases. The overall quality to these changes didn't begin during the pandemic, but because the pandemic, we accelerated the pace. In addition to cost savings and operational efficiencies, we also took several steps to preserve liquidity and maintain financial strength. We now have a capital structure with less maturity risk and more flexibility. So we accelerated the creation of new, highly relevant content for our clients. Across every function, we successfully pivoted to virtual conferences which were well attended and delivered high value to our clients. Our clients are more engaged than ever beyond client engagement. We adapted our operations to work remotely, just as effectively as we do from our offices, and we combine this with early and decisive actions to optimize our cost structure and our balance sheet. The combination of these factors has resulted in improvements across most of our operational metrics compared to future improvement in our operational metrics. In turn as a result, and improvements in our two three financial metrics and guidance compared to Q2 revenue and EBITDA are performing better than we expected. And free cash flow generation is very strong. To provide more details on our financial performance and increased guidance now, turn the call over to our CFO, Craig Safian. [00:25:01] Asia-pac Jean, first, we definitely look at new business for salesperson as one of our key metrics, you know, of the day, the reason we look at MiFi for salesperson is because that would that would net result in growth. But we manage the pieces of it, which are retention of our clients. And the new business is we absolutely manage the business per salesperson. [00:25:22] And the trend there has been has improved significantly between Q2 and Q3 as the numbers you saw from Craig and anything you'd say in terms of how you're managing headcount, in terms of the zero contract value associates and those that have a book of business, like, are there any big shifts occurring among those? [00:25:44] So it varies depending on the specific market and we tailor to the market. And so in markets where we have not that much contract volume because it's relatively immature market, we have more business developers, people that have zero contract value accounts than in a much more mature market like the United States for, you know, especially for GTS, for jobs across the board. We have a lot more business developers because those markets are so relatively under penetrated. So you don't need as many people that are what we call account managers that have existing clients just because the business is so much smaller in each of the disciplines. [00:26:59] So let me just started again. Correct. And fill in. So, you know, prior to 20, we were going through an investment period. We were investing really to position GBS to have a great future growth. And we entered that investment period in twenty nineteen. We came into twenty twenty before the pandemic even hit, focused on improving our margins over time. And part of the reason margins are better in twenty twenty to twenty nineteen are is that we were already focusing on how do we get the return on the investments that we put in place over the previous three years. We're still going to focus on that going to the future. Having said that, there are some expenses in Twenty twenty that are lower than they might be in a normal year. And obvious example, my minus travel expenses, where we basically have very low travel expenses compared to a normal year. And I can imagine in once the pandemic is over, we can probably see in our travel expenses will be, I wouldn't say go back to where it was before I thing. We've learned how to work more efficiently, but it would be larger than it would be in a year like Twenty twenty and going on if you want to fill in. [00:31:47] Hi, Tony. I don't know I don't know how fast the pace of recovery will be, but we certainly saw meaningful improvements between, you know, Q2 and Q3 in terms of demand as the numbers that went through in terms of like new business and so forth. If you look at China, China is interesting because they have recovered relatively quickly, like the you know, the new business growth in most of Japan and China in China has been quite good in Japan. Same thing, actually. And so if the rest of the world kind of goes the way of China and Japan, then we'll have a relatively quick recovery for us. [00:33:40] One of the things I tell you is if you just think about the capacity we've invested in building over the last several years in both GTS and GBS is pretty substantial. And so with that selling capacity, again, if we can approach 2019 productivity levels or core back half the gap between where we are today and 2019 productivity levels, we could actually drive really nice CV growth just from that capacity. And as Jim mentioned, our strategy because of the market opportunity we have is to continue to grow the sales force, which we will do to grow, capture that opportunity. But again, we always look at the two levers to drive massive growth over the medium term or long term. It's growing sales headcount to capture the market opportunity and driving productivity improvements at the same time. [00:35:29] The Jekyll's clearly the key driver in DBS going forward. We think we cross the threshold of 10000 seats in GBS, which initially was a major, major milestone. The Geeveston business is being driven by the fact that, you know, what we talked about all along, basically in each of the functions around the business, the executives have mission-critical priorities they need help with and they see Gartner's people to help them in. Our sales were extremely effective at reaching out to prospects, explained how we can help and the prospects of responding. And that's fundamentally what's driving the new business growth. And in fact, the it's really we're seeing the benefit of it now, even with the pandemic. But we talked with earlier the investments we made over the last two or three years before Twenty twenty, it's really starting to get the power from all those investments in GBS. [00:38:53] And the idea is that the we also it took a while to roll out all the jerko products and then the sales teams had to learn how to sell those products. And so I think they're now getting to the good part of that curve. [00:39:44] Good morning, Andrew. You know, with KVI being a rolling four quarter metric, we do still expect some deceleration in the contract value growth rate probably over the next quarter or two, predominantly because it's going up against a tough compare quarter and fourth quarter of last year. So if you look back at the fourth quarter of last year, you know, we've got significant growth and KVI in both teams and gas. And given the environment, our current estimate and extrapolating what we've seen in Q3 and March through the end of Q2 as well, we do not expect as much new business or similar renewal rates. And so we do expect some continued deceleration in the trough. As you think about it, just based on on on looking at it that way is probably Q1 of of next year. Again, we could outrun that if the economy improves significantly or if there is a vaccine and people go back to the office and everything like that. But we still remain cautious and are using really our last three months performance as a guide as we think about what Steve can do and and how we're building operational plans for the end of this year and for next year. [00:42:00] Yeah, it's hard it's hard to say, Andrew, predominantly because, you know, we have moved a number of conferences that we would have produced in person earlier in the year into the fourth quarter. And so we've obviously trimmed the portfolio and we've gone with a series of very important, very impactful conferences globally. And in addition, if you look at the Q4 implied guide, you have to also keep in mind that there's a hunk of event virtual meetings in there as well, which are pretty nice contributor to the to the overall number. You know, I think that as we roll into we're in the process of building out twenty, twenty one plans under a number of scenarios for four for next year. As Jean mentioned and I mentioned as well, we're getting better and smarter with each virtual conference that we actually deliver. And the next one gets better and better and better. And we're we're still really working on that exhibiter value proposition as well. [00:43:12] As I mentioned, you know, we expect exhibitor contribution in the fourth quarter to be significantly lower than what you would see historically. And obviously, we want to work really hard to improve that and deliver value to both our attendees from being exposed to the exhibitors and the exhibitors who get the corresponding value. So I wouldn't plug in a formula of 40 percent yet. We're still working through all those scenarios. And again, there are a number of different scenarios where we could be in person later in year, virtual beginning. There could be virtual all year long. You know, when we when we guide for for Twenty twenty one in February, we'll be very clear about what our assumptions include and will really be driven by what the environment allows us to do. [00:44:35] Hey, good morning, Jeff. So we for most of our most of the world we do are price increase in November. Actually, yesterday, the first day of November, as we went through the renewal cycle leading up to this November, obviously we were dealing with our our standard price increase. You know, in this environment, there was probably there's definitely a little bit more pushback than we historically say are our price increase. As you know, Ranges has ranged in the three to four percent range historically, and it's typically not big dollars for the client. And we are always improving our products and our experience this year, given the environment, we were a little more modest on the price increase going around, you know, between two and a half to three percent price increase again, which just went into effect. Now, you know, we generally our clients understand that we are improving the product each and every year. The people that deliver the service, their costs go up every year. And so, generally speaking, we haven't seen a ton of pushback on the pricing. But definitely in this environment, it's a little more challenging than what we normally see. But generally speaking, it's modest dollars that we're pushing through look great. [00:46:25] If if you if you take a look at the you can see list pricing online, the pricing is about 40 percent of what we would get from an in-person conference ticket. So think about it in roughly that range in terms of the you know, if you're buying a cash ticket as a standalone item, again, either online or through one of our sales teams on the exhibiter side, as we've mentioned, it's still really early days and we're working through all that. And so there's really not an apples to apples comparison from an exhibitor perspective. [00:50:21] So you've started on it, mentioned in his remarks that in GTA seed grew and nearly all of our 10 largest countries was up double digits in Brazil, Japan, France and the Netherlands. And KVI grew across all sectors except for transportation and media, and it grew across every size enterprise. And so that kind of gives you a flavor for for GTA in GBS, we found we had growth, basically contributions from all the practice areas, meaning like H.R., Supply-Chain, sales, et cetera, except marketing. [00:50:55] As Craig mentioned his remarks, the marketing piece, we have some products that were just continuing which pulled that piece down, but the rest is quite strong. [00:52:11] With regard to Lockdown's, we've you know, with our sales teams, we've had a discussion on what impact does it have, like in certain European countries. Now they're going back to Stronger Lockdown's. At least our sales team's perspective on it is that both we and our clients have learned to work in a lockdown environment and they don't anticipate the increased lockdowns you're seeing like in Europe having an impact on our bookings. So time will tell. But that's the sales change perspective. [00:54:12] I'd add that, you know, we made a bunch of investments coming into twenty twenty and, you know, sort of the 17, 18, 19 period and 19 margins reflected that we came into at Twenty twenty focused on getting a return on those investments and having tight cost controls. And we expect to keep getting return on those investments over the next few years, as I mentioned earlier. And we intend to keep a tight cost controls as well. And so we're very focused on managing our margins in future years as well. [00:56:11] And as I would just add that, you know, it's going to really correlate very, very tightly to CV growth. And so, you know, again, it's sort of an output of CV growth or, you know, if you're running back the other way and input into the overall CV growth. But given that we have gotten disciplined, much more disciplined around the headcount growth and headcount vestments and Jean's point, getting yield on those investments and that we'll start having quote unquote easier compares in Q2, you know, the CV growth trough and the productivity growth trough should be on guard at very helpful. [00:57:21] Yeah, the church randomization is really important to us because different territories have different structural characteristics that make them better or worse, a kind of simple and it varies over time. A simple example is a territory selling to restaurants in this state today doesn't have as much upside potential as a territory selling to tech companies. And so we real time shift our territories around to the territories that are away from the ones that are potentially the ones that have a lot of more potential. So it's not a one time thing if we just implemented kind of the most sophisticated versions of our church we're planning this year. And it's something we're going into an ongoing basis as the economy around us changes. And it's an important driver of sales productivity. [00:59:01] Hey, Jeanne, so we've heard a lot of lessons, personal conferences, as Craig mentioned, we started with some pilots in Q2 and then have held our our virtual equivalents that were large of our larger conferences this year. Same thing is true, actually, of the events of conferences in the past, were in person, in person, and now are all virtual. And we've learned things about like what technologies to use. Some technologies work better than others. And each time we have, you know, things didn't work as well as we planned, we fix those technology problems. We've been experiment with things like how long each session should be, you know, because in a virtual environment, people on different session lengths. We experimented with how long the conference itself should be. Should it be two days, four days for the for the longer conferences and getting customer feedback or tweaking the length of the conferences. The content is pretty much the same and production values are very similar if you go to any of our conferences. And that has worked pretty well. So those are kind of the key learnings, I'd say. And in terms of opportunity, expand. You know, the way we're looking at it is if there's demand going forward, when in person conferences return, if there's still demand for personal promises, we're going to be really well positioned to do that. And we will certainly do it if demand is there. And my what I believe is demand will be there, but we're going to be flexible based on what the market says. [01:00:35] So summarize what you heard in today's call. We accelerated the creation of new, highly relevant content for our clients. Across every function, we successfully pivoted to virtual conferences which were well attended and delivered high value to our clients. Our clients are more engaged than ever. The client engagement. We adapted our operations to work remotely, just effectively, as we did from our offices, and we combined this early, decisive actions to optimize our cost structure. The combination of these factors has resulted in improvements across most of our operational metrics compared to the improvement in our operational metrics. In turn, has resulted improvement in our Q3 financial metrics and guidance compared to Q2 revenue and even performed better than we expected in free cash flow generation is very strong. Thanks for joining us and I look forward to updating you again later in the New Year. [01:01:24] Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now just."

            "content": "[00:07:33] Thank you, Gene, and good morning. I hope everyone remains safe and well. Third quarter results were ahead of our expectations, and we raised our full year guidance to reflect the modestly better demand environment and strong cost management. We had another successful bond offering during the quarter and amended and extended our credit facility through two thousand twenty five as of September 30th. We have a stronger balance sheet than we did at the start of the year. We have significant liquidity, which gives us financial flexibility. We reduced our maturity risk and our annual interest expense will be lower starting in twenty twenty one. As we've gotten more clarity on the economy engaged our business performance over the past several months, we resumed targeted spending. While we continue to manage our costs carefully, we remain focused on positioning ourselves to rebound strongly as the economy recovers. Third quarter revenue was nine hundred ninety five million dollars, down one percent as reported and neutral. Excluding conferences, our revenues were up five percent year over year. Ethics neutral. In addition, contribution margin was sixty seven percent, up more than 300 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was one hundred and sixty eight dollars million of twenty percent year over year and nineteen percent effective neutral adjusted EPS was ninety one cents and free cash flow in the quarter was a very strong two hundred and twenty nine million dollars. [00:08:50] Research revenue in the third quarter grew six percent year over year on a reported and neutral basis. Third quarter research contribution margin was seventy two percent, benefiting in part from the temporary cost avoidance initiatives we put in place starting in the first quarter. As we have seen improvements in the macro environment, we have resumed growth spending and start to restore some of the compensation and benefit programs which we put on hold. When the pandemic first hit, total contract value was three point four dollars million at September 30th, representing eFax natural growth of five percent versus the prior year. Global technology sales contract value at the end of the third quarter was two point eight dollars billion, up five percent versus the prior year. The more challenging selling environment that began in March continue through the third quarter and had an impact on most of our reported metrics. Client retention for GTS was 80 percent, down about one hundred and sixty basis points year over year, but up modestly from last quarter, while retention for GTS was ninety nine percent for the quarter, down about six hundred basis points year over year. GTS new business declined seven percent versus last year we ended. The third quarter with Enterprise is down about three percent from last year. [00:09:57] The average contract value for enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at two hundred twenty seven thousand dollars for Enterprise, which GTS up nine percent year over year growth and KVI for Enterprise reflects the combination of sales, increased number of subscriptions and price. In addition, we continue to see higher churn among the lower spending clients. At the end of the third quarter, the number of quarter bearing associates and GTS was down about eight percent year over year. We expect to end Twenty twenty with more than thirty one hundred quarter bearing associates, a slight decline from the end of twenty nineteen. We entered this year with a large bench which we have now fully deployed for GTS the year over year and contract value increase or No\u0308kkvi divided by the beginning period, quota bearing headcount was forty one thousand dollars per salesperson. Down about 60 percent versus the third quarter of last year, despite the challenging macro environment, GCD grew Gruene nearly all of our 10 largest countries and similar to last quarter was up double digits in Brazil, Japan, France and the Netherlands. KVI grew across all sectors except for transportation and media across our entire GTA sales team. We sold significant amounts of new business in the quarter to both existing and new clients. [00:11:08] New logos continue to be a significant contributor to our growth. Finally, despite some returning clients, we continue to see increased spending by retain clients on average, although not quite enough to offset dollar attrition. This speaks to the compelling client value proposition we offer is both strong and challenging economic environments. Overall retention and new business improved in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter global business sales contract volume six hundred fifty six dollars million at the end of the third quarter. That's about 20 percent of our total contract value. KVI growth was six percent year over year as reported, and five percent on an organic basis. KVI growth in the quarter was led by our supply chain and human resources teams. All practices positively contributed to the six percent growth rate for jobs. With the exception of marketing, GBS new business was strong of fourteen percent over last year. As we've discussed the last three quarters and the marketing practice, we are transitioning away from some lower margin products. This has created short term headwinds but is expected to improve profitability in a normal environment. GE Excel is now more than 50 percent of total contract value, an important milestone in the path to long term sustained double digit growth in GBS. Client retention for GBS was eighty two percent, up one hundred seventeen basis points year over year, while retention for GBS was ninety nine percent for the quarter, up 220 basis points year over year. [00:12:33] We ended the third quarter with kvass. Enterprise is down about nine percent from last year. As we continue to see churn of legacy clients, the average contract value for enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at one hundred forty thousand dollars per enterprise and GBS of sixteen percent year over year growth and CV for enterprise reflects also an increased number of subscriptions, penetration of new functional areas and price. Despite the pandemic, our retain clients are continuing to spend more with us every year, although not quite enough to offset attrition. At the end of the third quarter, the number of quarter bearing associates in GBS was down seven percent. Year over year. We expect to end twenty twenty with roughly flat headcount at the end of twenty nineteen in GBS. For GBS, the year over year contract value increase or NCBI divided by the beginning period quarter headcount was thirty eight thousand dollars per salesperson up from last year. Overall, GBS had a good third quarter, driven by a strong double digit year over year improvement in your business. As you know, the conferences segment has been materially impacted by the global pandemic. [00:13:38] We canceled all in person destination conferences for the remainder of Twenty twenty. We pivoted to producing virtual conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver for our clients. We held two virtual conferences in the third quarter after producing pilots in the second quarter. We also held a number of virtual events, meetings, shifting these one day local conferences online. Due to the pandemic conferences, revenue for the quarter was 13 million dollars, a combination of the two virtual conferences and a number of virtual events and meetings. We are still in the early stages of all forms of virtual conferences, and we'll continue to leverage customer feedback as we develop, refine and grow our virtual conference offerings. The revenue mix of our virtual conferences is different from the mix, from in-person conferences. First, in Q3, our revenues were split between virtual conferences and virtual Advanta meetings with a higher mix from event and meetings than last year. Attendees revenue with virtual conferences is from two sources tickets that are purchased as a standalone item either online or for sales teams, or an entitlement associated with a broader research contract. [00:14:44] As we've detailed in the past, a small portion of many research contracts gets attributed to the conferences segment, the vast majority of the two, three and expected to four attendees. Revenue is from subscription contract entitlements. [00:14:57] These are entitlements which would have been applied to in-person conferences and twenty twenty or in some cases in thousand twenty one. We continue to refine our exhibitor offerings for virtual conferences. We expect you for exhibiter revenue to be a much smaller part of overall conferences revenue than in the past. We continue to incur costs both in cost of services and to support virtual conferences and to be in a position to resume in-person conferences when it is safe and permitted. [00:15:24] Lastly, the timing of receiving conference cancelation insurance claims remains uncertain, so we will not record any coverage in expenses incurred until the receipt of the insurance proceeds. Third quarter consulting revenues decreased by four percent year over year to eighty nine million dollars on an annual basis. Revenues declined six percent. Consulting contribution margin was thirty two percent in the third quarter of over 300 basis points versus the prior year quarter margins were up primarily due to cost reduction actions. Labor based revenues were seventy four million dollars, down five percent versus Q3 of last year, or six percent on an annual basis. Labor based global headcount of seven hundred thirty seven was down nine percent. Utilization was sixty percent of about three hundred basis points year over year. Backlog at September 30th was ninety six million dollars, down twelve percent year over year on an annual basis. Our backlog provides us with about four months of forward revenue coverage. As we discussed last quarter, we had a small workforce action consulting business to align our billable headcount with our revenue outlook for the balance of the year. Our contract optimization business was down three percent on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter. This compares to a seventy four percent growth rate in the third quarter last year. As we detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. Stena increased two percent year over year and the third quarter and one percent on an annual basis as Gene\u0301 as a percentage of revenue increased in the quarter as we restored certain compensation and benefits costs, EBITDA for the third quarter was one hundred and sixty eight dollars million of twenty percent year over year on a reported basis and a nineteen percent effective neutral. [00:17:04] As I mentioned earlier, we had stronger than expected topline performance and continue our disciplined focus on expenses. We also continue to see a meaningful benefit from significantly lower than normal travel costs. Depreciation in the quarter was up approximately two million dollars from last year, although flat with second quarter as a result of additional office space that had gone into service before the pandemic. IT amortization was about flat sequentially. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was twenty nine million dollars, up from twenty two million dollars in the third quarter of twenty nineteen. Net interest expense is up because our interest rate swaps at higher fixed rates in the warrants which expired last year. The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was twenty percent for the quarter tax rate for the items used to adjust. That income was twenty six point four percent in the quarter. Adjusted EPS one, two, three was ninety one cents. Operating cash flow for the quarter was two hundred forty four million dollars, compared to two hundred twenty million dollars last year. [00:18:04] The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by cost avoidance initiatives, partially offset by an earlier interest payment due to the refinancing capex for the quarter was 15 million dollars now. Fifty nine percent year over year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate expansion needs due to the pandemic. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities. Less capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the quarter was two hundred twenty nine dollars million, which is up twenty five percent versus the prior year. This includes outflows of about 10 million dollars of acquisition, integration and other non-recurring items. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 15 percent on a rolling four quarter basis. Continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years, free cash flow as a percent of net income was about two hundred eighty five percent. Free cash flow benefited from continued strong collections, combined with reductions in outflows from our cost avoidance initiatives, lower capital expenditures and lower cash taxes and deferrals of certain tax payments. While we've seen timing benefits to our free cash flow margin from significantly lower capex and our ability to defer certain tax payments, even excluding these LTM free cash flow margin is still up about 200 basis points versus the prior year. [00:19:18] During the quarter, we took advantage of historically attractive high yield bond pricing and issued eight hundred million dollars of new 10 year senior unsecured notes with a three point seventy five percent coupon. We use the proceeds from this new issuance to extinguish our two thousand twenty five bonds, which carry a five and an eight percent coupon. We also amended and extended our credit facility to September twenty twenty five with attractive financial terms, increased flexibility and fewer less restrictive covenants. The overall impact of the financing activities resulted in a 50 basis point reduction to total cost of borrowing. The combination of the capital markets activities in the past six months has extended our debt maturity profile to nearly eight years versus less than three years pre pandemic or September 30th. [00:20:01] That balance was two billion dollars. Our reported gross debt, trailing 12 month EBITDA is about two point five times our total modified net debt covenant. Leverage ratio was two point three times at the end of the third quarter, well within the five times covenant limit. At the end of the third quarter, we had five hundred and fifty four million dollars of cash. After pausing share repurchases at the start of the pandemic, we are in a position to resume our normal capital allocation programs. [00:20:28] Going forward, we will deploy excess cash for share repurchases and strategic tuck in acquisitions. At the end of the quarter, we had about one billion dollars of revolver capacity and have around six hundred and eighty million dollars. With meeting on our share repurchase authorization, we are updating our full year outlook to reflect Jeoffrey performance, a modestly better demand environment, including the successful launch of virtual conferences and cost restoration plans last quarter. When updating guidance, we were cautious because we had only been through one full quarter of the pandemic and we had two quarters remaining in the year with more experience, better performance and more visibility. You've updated our guidance. Accordingly, we now forecast research revenue of at least three point fifty seven dollars billion for the full year. This is growth of almost six percent versus twenty nineteen and reflects a continuation of third quarter new business and retention trends for the conferences segment. We are generating revenue from our virtual conferences. We now expect revenue one hundred and ten million dollars for the full year. This reflects our initial success in launching virtual conferences and virtual events meetings. The majority of the incremental revenue we expect in conferences is from entitlements included in some of our subscription contracts. As we discussed earlier, we now forecast consulting revenue of at least three hundred and seventy million dollars for the full year, or decline of about six percent. [00:21:47] The consulting outlook continues to contemplate a slowdown in labor based demand. The timing of revenue in the contract optimization business can be highly variable. As you know, overall, we expect consolidated revenue of at least four point zero five billion dollars. That's reported decline of about five percent versus twenty nineteen. Excluding conferences, we expect revenue growth of at least four point five percent versus twenty eighteen on a reported basis. The cost avoidance programs we put in place in March have allowed us to protect profitability and conserve cash. We started to resume certain spending late in the second quarter. As the operating environment appears to have at least stabilized. We want to ensure we are well positioned for an economic normalization. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least seven hundred forty million dollars. That's full year margins of about eighteen point three percent, up from sixteen point one percent margins we had in twenty eighteen. We expect a full year twenty twenty net interest expense to be one hundred and six million dollars. We continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of around twenty two percent for Twenty twenty. [00:22:48] This doesn't apply a higher fourth quarter rate than we've seen throughout twenty twenty consistent with our experience in recent years, we expect twenty twenty adjusted EPS of at least four dollars and seven cents for Twenty twenty. We expect free cash flow of at least six hundred twenty five million dollars. Our free cash flow guidance reflects both the outlook we just discussed strong capex management and better than previously forecasted collections, all the details of our full year guidance are included on our investor relations site. In summary, despite a very uncertain economic environment, we delivered better than planned financial results in the third quarter, which has allowed us to update our full year outlook favorably. Most of our key operating metrics improved in the quarter, and we were able to successfully launch and monetize virtual conferences in virtual events and meetings. Cash flow was outstanding and we have taken a number of measures to increase our financial flexibility, reduce maturity risk and ensure we have ample liquidity. We will continue to balance cost avoidance programs with targeted investments and restoration of certain expenses to ensure we are well-positioned to rebound when the economy recovers. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator. [00:28:06] Yeah. Good morning, Jeff. You know, the only two things I would add are that, you know, in terms of the cost avoidance, you know, we were very aggressive in the early days of the pandemic when we really didn't know what the outcome was going to look like. As we stabilized, we obviously started turning certain expenses back on, particularly related to compensation and benefits expenses for our associates, as well as backfilling ogen roles and actually shrinking, sparkling in a little bit of headcount growth in GTS and GBS sales forces. And so, you know, we were first focused on just making sure that we could preserve profitability. And then once we we had aligned to that or I said to that, we we started selectively turning certain expenses back on to Jean's point, Twenty twenty is hardly a normal year by any definition. And so, you know, the way we've been managing the business and again, we have been restoring a lot of costs in the back half of the year and we were able to get virtual conferences launched and monetized. That's obviously playing a large role in in the margin profile for for for Twenty twenty. You know, as we look forward, the way we sort of think about it from a medium term perspective is that we can absolutely drive double digit top line growth and modestly expand margins over at least the medium term. [00:29:46] We will expand margins from the twenty nineteen levels, which is our last normal year benchmark, if you will. And to the point he made, we are very committed to maintaining tight cost. Trolls like you've seen from us this year, we will have to turn certain things back on, but things like travel, we will have to travel more. We will have more expense there, but it will probably not run all the way back up to what we did in twenty nineteen. Similarly with facilities, you know, we've obviously had a lot of operational benefits this year from not having to heat and cool and run facilities as we've been working from home. Hopefully we will be back into service at some point and those expenses will come back. Although I will say that as we go forward, we probably won't need to expand our facilities footprint at the same pace that we did in the past. And so there's a lot of moving parts there. [00:30:45] But I think the key point is that over the medium term, we believe that we can drive double digit top line growth and modestly expand our margins. [00:33:00] Yeah, Gruner, Salesforce is an important part of our growth strategy. And so over time, we expect to grow our sales force in kind of in line with our contract volume growth. And so that's kind of the long term strategy we came into this year. So at the end of last year, we added a substantial amount of headcount as we came into this year for to allow our growth during Twenty twenty. Now, obviously, the pandemic is that we haven't realized that gross. We actually have a lot of sales capacity that we think as the market improves, will give us a good uplift and then we're going to use that leverage that will also then grow our sales headcount. Do you think about in line with KB as we go forward to support future growth? [00:36:20] And Gary, good morning. I would just add, you know, as I mentioned in my remarks just now, GSL now represents more than 50 percent of the contract value within GBS. So it really is a story going forward that is the predominant amount of contract value within the portfolio. And then the other nice thing I would add is that we're seeing really good contribution across the across the GBS practice portfolio. So it's not just a supply chain or it's not just the HRR. We're seeing a really good contribution in finance, in HRR, in supply chain and sales, et cetera. And so that it's not just one story, that it's across the portfolio. [00:37:49] Yeah, I'll start again if I if I may say. Can you fill in the blanks? No, I think that if you look back at the GBS performance, we really started to see a nice acceleration in the business in Q3 of last year. And so it's not the easiest compare we've had for sure. Know, I think there's definitely a benefit to having a more tenured sales force and having them have significant experience with selling the standard set of products we have. And so that is absolutely a benefit. But I really do believe and I echo what you said earlier, it's really about the value we're providing to the end users in each of these markets as opposed to an easy comp or more experience. And so those things help. But I think ultimately it's because we we provide a great value and help business leaders across each of those enterprise functions really solve and win on their mission critical priorities. [00:48:29] No, I think that's right again. And it's a combination and go into detail of this last quarter in Q2 and actually, you know, we rolled into Q3. Each of these measures actually improved. And so, you know, the point on fewer clients increasing or increasing at a lower rate, that trend continued into Q3, but it was definitely better than what we experienced in Q2. And the same could be said around clients that were reducing their spend. So we still saw that same happen in Q3, but it was much less pronounced than what we experienced in Q2. [00:49:27] Yeah, I mean, historically, if you go back to the last normal year, we had eventa revenues were in the roughly 15 percent of total revenue range this year. Given what's happening, they're running closer to around a quarter of the conference revenue, just to put it in in rough perspective. [00:51:04] And George, you know, in terms of the outlook, you know, it's been choppy all along. It varies by region and geography in terms of lockdown's and relock downs and and things of that nature. [00:51:22] And so, you know, we've the good news for for a business like ours is the hunk of the revenue on the research line is is baked based on where we finished Q3. [00:51:37] And so, you know, the guy doesn't really doesn't get impacted all that significantly from whether, you know, there are new lockdown's or otherwise. Obviously, you know, it could have an impact on next year. But I think our sales teams are really focused on working through this. They've proven they can work through it in a lockdown or non lockdown environment. And we'll just continue working through the the selling cycles and renewal cycles as we close the year to the book as much and KVI and as much contract value growth is as possible. [00:52:57] Yeah, it's a lot of it will be dependent on where we finish this year from a contract value growth perspective. And that has a pretty material or very material impact on the revenue run out for four for next year. You know, we have started to restore a lot of expenses related to compensation and benefits which continue to run consistently. And so there won't be a hurt or should be significant one time hurt when we put those those back on know, I think, you know, we'll obviously provide full color on on Twenty twenty one guidance in February when when when we get there. But for now, you know, we're just really focused on making sure that we we finish the year strong. You know, obviously, we have been able to take up our guidance on just about every count, you know, pretty, pretty nicely. And teams are just focused on making sure we finish the year strong and we'll we'll address what the internal margins look like and what the overall outlook looks like in February in Georgia. [00:55:26] So it's hard to forecast exactly when sales first person is going to drop as we come to to the call. We've certainly seen this year between Q2 and Q3 and improving all the kind of underlying all the underlying operational metrics that drive sales productivity. I talked about one of them, one client engagement, which ultimately drives retention and new business performed better than in Q3 than in Q2. And so those are things that are going to kind of drive it over time. I think we are learning how to sell in the pandemic has a factor. And so that will continue to get better. They also obviously, the more companies that go out of business and can't buy our products because of business, that has an impact on our productivity as well. So it's those kinds of factors. [00:58:06] And then on the non subspecialties, the it's actually holding up pretty well. It was down three percent year over year in the quarter, which is better than we had initially forecasted. So the answer to your point, relatively small things, but it's holding up better than we had initially thought, down three percent year over year."

We encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nEugene Hall: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The COVID-19 pandemic will have a permanent and dramatic impact on business, leadership and society. Leaders face more simultaneous challenges than ever before \u2013 health and safety risks, sustained macroeconomic dislocations, shifting customer expectations, regulatory changes, combating racism and strengthening social justice, cybersecurity risks and more. Gartner is the best source of the timely and relevant insights, advice and tools that empower leaders across every major enterprise function to achieve success with their mission critical priorities.  With our forward-looking research and our ability to be agile in supporting our clients through ongoing uncertainty, demand for analyst interactions is up almost 30% year-over-year. Clients and non-clients alike continue to leverage our Coronavirus Resource Center as we plan for the reset.  With the challenging macroeconomic conditions, we're seeing an uptick in leaders accessing our cost optimization content. And with the ongoing fight for social justice, we're seeing significant engagement with our diversity, equity and inclusion resource center. This resource center aggregates much of our broadly relevant HR insights on diversity, inclusion and engagement, along with critical tools and webinars and makes them publicly accessible.  We recently reinforced our own commitment to diversity, inclusion and social equity. Consistent with our research advice to clients, we increased the level of programming engagement of our employee resource groups \u2013 women, pride, mosaic, and veterans at Gartner.  We reinstated our charity match program to empower our associates to have even greater impact through the organizations they choose. We established a cross functional executive council on diversity and inclusion and we published our corporate social responsibility report outlying actions we've taken to improve our operations and support our clients.  Gartner remains strong as we continue navigating global uncertainties. Our second quarter results reflect our unique value proposition across all major functions of the enterprise.  I'll share a few highlights and Craig will give you the full details in a moment. For the second quarter of 2020, total revenues were down 8% year-over-year. However, excluding the impact of our Conferences business, revenues were up 6% year-over-year, and we drew improvements in EBITDA and free cash flow was up 71%.  We continue to calibrate our cost reduction programs. We strategically paused spending in March to protect profitability and conserve cash. We've restored some of the spend in targeted areas. We remain committed to full-year margins of at least 16.1%.  Research, our largest and most profitable segment, is the core of our value proposition. We continue to make a significant global impact through our Research business.  Total Research revenues were up 8% over this time last year. And while the selling front remains challenging, we did see modestly better trends in June than in the first two months of the quarter. Global technology sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS represents more than 80% of our total Research contract value. Global business sales, or GPS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT, including HR, finance, legal, sales, supply chain, marketing and more. GBS represents about 20% of our total Research contract value. In the second quarter 2020, both GTS and GBS drove similar contract value growth performances of around 7%. In GTS, we saw strong performances across many regions and sectors, including countries in Asia, Latin America and Europe and industries including retail, services and technology. In GBS, year-over-year contract value was up across every practice area except marketing.  As I mentioned last quarter, our Conferences segment was significantly impacted by COVID-19. Because of government mandates and health concerns, we were unable to hold any destination conferences during Q2.  To prioritize the health and safety of our attendees, partners and associates, we have decided to cancel our in-person conferences for the remainder of 2020 and pivot a subset of these conferences to a virtual format.  Gartner Virtual Conferences will provide attendees a flexible way to gain unparalleled insights and advice and accelerate their learning without the need to travel. We'll monetize these conferences as we perfect the virtual format. Look to the long term, we expect the future as a combination of in-person and virtual conferences. We continue to expect Conferences will be an important contributor to our overall business.  Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research and provides clients with a deeper level of involvement through extended project based work to help them execute their most strategic initiatives.  Consulting revenues were down year-over-year in Q2, but we had strong results in contract optimization.  In summary, we continue to have a strong value proposition across all major enterprise functions. Our clients are facing more disruptive change than ever before. And Gartner is the best source for the cost effective, relevant insights that will empower leaders to succeed amid ongoing uncertainty.  We continue to have a vast untapped market opportunity. We know the right things to do to capture that opportunity in thriving or uncertain times.  Looking ahead, we expect to come out of this recession strong and well positioned to drive long term, sustained, double-digit growth in revenues, earnings and free cash flow for years to come.  With that, I'll hand the call over to our CFO, Craig Safian. \nCraig Safian : Thank you, Gene. And good morning, everyone. I hope everyone remains safe and well.  Second quarter results were ahead of our expectations due to a modestly better demand environment and strong cost management execution. We had a successful bond offering during the quarter which allowed us to reduce maturity risk without increasing our annual cash interest costs this year.  As we've gotten more clarity on the economy and gauged our business performance over the past several months, we've resumed backfilling roles and making selective growth hires. While we continue to manage our costs carefully, we remain focused on positioning ourselves to rebound strongly when the economy recovers.  Second quarter revenue was $973 million, down 9% as reported and down 8% FX neutral. Excluding Conferences, our revenues were up 6% year-over-year FX neutral.  In addition, contribution margin was 67%, up more than 300 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $192 million, up 4% year-over-year and up 6% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $1.20 cents and free cash flow in the quarter was a very strong $322 million. Research revenue in the second quarter grew 6% year-over-year on a reported basis and 8% on an FX neutral basis. Second quarter research contribution margin was 72%, benefiting in part from the temporary cost avoidance initiatives we put in place last quarter. As the macroenvironment improves, we will take a balanced approach to resuming growth spending and incenting our associates who are the core of our business.  Total contract value was $3.4 billion at June 30, representing FX neutral growth of 7% versus the prior year. Global technology sales contract value at the end of the second quarter was $2.8 billion, up 7% versus the prior year.  The more challenging selling environment that began in March continued in the second quarter and had an impact on most of our reported metrics.  Client retention for GTS was 80%, down about 260 basis points year-over-year, while retention for GTS was 100% for the quarter, down about 470 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business declined 14% versus last year. We ended the second quarter with 12,381 GTS enterprises, down slightly from last year.  The average contract value per enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at $223,000 per enterprise in GTS, up 10% year-over-year. Growth and CV per enterprise reflects the combination of upsell, increased number of subscriptions and price.  At the end of the second quarter, we had 3,089 quota-bearing associates in GTS or a decline of 4% year-over-year. We expect to end 2020 with more than 3,100 quota-bearing associates, a slight decline from the end of 2019. We entered this year with a large bench which we have now fully deployed.  For GTS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning period quota-bearing headcount was $58,000 per salesperson, down 48% versus the second quarter of last year. Despite the challenging macroenvironment, GTS CV grew in nearly all of our 10 largest countries and was up double digits in Brazil, Japan, France and the Netherlands. CV grew across all sectors except for transportation, which was down modestly.  The smallest enterprises we serve saw double-digit CV growth through the strong efforts of our mid-sized enterprise sales teams. Across our entire GTS sales team, we sold significant amounts of new business in the quarter, to both existing and new clients. New logos continued to be a significant contributor to our CV growth.  Finally, despite some net churn in clients, we continue to see increased spending by retained clients on average. This speaks to the compelling client value proposition we offer in both strong and challenging economic environments.  Global business sales contract value was $643 million at the end of the second quarter. That's about 20% of our total contract value. CV growth was 7% year-over-year as reported and 6% on an organic basis. CV growth in the quarter was led by supply chain and the human resources practice. All practices positively contributed to the 7% CV growth rate for GBS, with the exception of marketing. GxL CV grew 40% to $319 million and legacy CV declined 14% year-over-year to $324 million. Total GBS new business was $36 million in the quarter, down 8%. However, we saw strong new business in our finance and sales practices.  As we've discussed the last two quarters, in the marketing practice, we are transitioning away from some lower margin products. This has created short-term headwinds, but is expected to improve profitability in a normal environment. Because GxL will comprise the majority of GBS CV, starting next quarter, we will be reporting total GBS only. In the second quarter, total GxL new business was $31 million, while legacy new business was $5 million. Also in the second quarter, GxL attrition was $19 million and legacy attrition was $20 million. GxL retention performance year-over-year was consistent with GTS. Client retention for GBS was 83%, up about 170 basis points year-over-year, while retention for GBS was 100% for the quarter, up about 520 basis points year-over-year. We ended the second quarter with 4,789 GBS enterprises, down about 7% from last year. The average contract value per enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at $134,000 per enterprise in GBS, up 15% year-over-year.  Growth in CV per enterprise reflects upsell and increased number of subscriptions and price. Despite the pandemic, our retained clients are continuing to spend more with us every year.  At the end of the second quarter, we had 834 quota-bearing associates of GBS, down 9% year-over-year. Headcount was down sequentially and year-over-year as we optimized our territories and then temporarily froze hiring as part of our cost avoidance program. We now expect to end 2020 with roughly flat headcount to the end of 2019 in GBS. For GBS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning-period quota-bearing headcount was $43,000 per salesperson, up from last year.  As you know, the Conferences segment has been materially impacted by the global pandemic. We have canceled all destination conferences for the remainder of 2020. We are pivoting to producing virtual conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver for our clients. We held three virtual conferences in the second quarter, which were used as pilots for the rest of the year. We also held a number of our one-day local conferences with a virtual format.  We expect our local conferences business to rebound faster than the destination conferences given the smaller size of the gatherings, no need for travel and strong relationships and sense of community among the participants.  With the cancellation of the fourth quarter destination conferences, unfortunately, we had to reduce the number of associates in the business. We continue to incur costs both in cost of services and SG&A to support the virtual conferences and to be in a position to resume in-person conferences when it is safe and permitted. The second quarter is a reasonable run rate for how to think about conferences costs for the rest of the year.  I also wanted to provide you with an update on potential termination or sunk costs on canceled conferences as well as situation with our event cancellation insurance. We expect to recover the majority of sunk and potential termination costs for future conferences through either force majeure clauses in our vendor contracts, other arrangements with vendors or event cancellation insurance claims.  Timing of receiving insurance claims is uncertain, so we will not record any recoveries in excess of expenses incurred until the receipt of the insurance proceeds. Our guidance for 2020 continues to assume no conferences will be held for the remainder of the year.  Second quarter consulting revenues decreased by 6% year-over-year to $97 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues declined 5%. Consulting contribution margin was 34% in the second quarter, up over 130 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. Margins were up due to favorable mix and cost reduction actions.  Labor base revenues were $69 million, down 13% versus Q2 of last year or 12% on an FX neutral basis. Labor base billable headcount of 796 was up 3%. Utilization was 59%.  Backlog at June 30 was $99 million, down 10% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. Our backlog provides us with about four-and-a-half months of forward revenue coverage.  We had a small workforce action in the Consulting business in the second quarter to better align our billable headcount with our revenue outlook for the balance of the year.  Our Consulting business is seeing demand in three broad areas \u2013 digital, cost optimization, and data and analytics. Demand in digital spans several areas, including digital strategy, digital talent and digital workplace. Cost optimization also spans several areas such as sourcing and vendor management, infrastructure and operations, and application rationalization.  Our contract optimization business, which is a part of our broader cost optimization offerings, had a strong quarter. Revenues were up 17% on a reported basis versus the prior-year quarter. As we've detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable and we face continuing tough compares as we move through the year.  SG&A decreased 4% year-over-year in the second quarter and 2% on an FX neutral basis as the cost avoidance initiatives we put in place last quarter continued to generate savings. SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased in the quarter, driven by recognition of commissions from canceled conferences and severance.  EBITDA for the second quarter was $192 million, up 4% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 6% FX neutral as we offset loss conference margins with significant cost avoidance and cost reductions.  Depreciation in the quarter was approximately $3 million from last year, although about flat with the first quarter as a result of additional office space that had gone into service before the pandemic hit. Amortization was about flat sequentially.  Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs, in the quarter was $27 million, up from $23 million in the second quarter of 2019. Net interest expense is up because we had higher debt balances in the quarter and our interest rate swaps had higher fixed rates than the ones which expired last year.  The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 15.3% for the quarter. The tax rate used for the items used to adjust net income was 22.8% in the quarter.  The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was affected positively as expected by an intercompany sale of intellectual property which resulted in a material favorable impact on the adjusted tax rate. This benefit was already reflected in our full year guidance.  Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $1.20 cents.  As a reminder, last quarter, we updated the definition we use for free cash flow to be cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, and we will no longer be adding back adjustments or non-recurring items. This free cash flow definition provides a measure that reflects cash available for capital allocation, like debt repayment and share repurchases.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $343 million compared to $227 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by cost avoidance initiatives and lower tax payments.  CapEx for the quarter was $21 million, down 46% year-over-year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $322 million, which is up 71% versus the prior year. This includes outflows of about $10 million of acquisition, integration and other non-recurring items.  Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 13% on a rolling four quarter basis, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow as a percent of GAAP net income was about 230%.  During quarter, we issued $800 million of new senior unsecured notes with a 4.5% coupon. We use the proceeds from the notes along with $200 million of balance sheet cash to repay $1 billion of debt on a revolver and term loan A during March 2022. We reduced maturity risk while providing more financial flexibility at a relatively low cost.  Our June 30 debt balance was $2 billion. Our total debt covenant leverage ratio was 2.8 times at the end of the second quarter, well within the 5 times covenant limit. Our other financial covenants are also well within compliance levels.  At the end of the second quarter, we had $357 million of cash. As we discussed last quarter, we paused our share repurchase activity. As we get increased clarity on how the pandemic and economic downturn will play out, we will deploy excess cash for debt repayment, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. We also have about $1.2 billion of revolver capacity.  In addition to our strong cash position, balance sheet flexibility and access to capital, we have taken steps to align our cost with our revenue, allowing us to continue to generate positive free cash flow.  Going into the current situation, we had already built a plan for 2020 that aligned cost growth with revenue growth. As we outlined last quarter, we took additional steps to ensure our long-term financial health and operational Excellence through a number of cost avoidance initiatives.  These decisive actions helped ensure our ongoing financial flexibility in this challenging and uncertain environment without compromising on the quality of the insight, advice and service we provide to our clients. We remain well positioned to reaccelerate and drive future growth once the timing of the economic recovery from this pandemic becomes more evident.  Before I go through the outlook assumptions for each segment, I'll review the overall approach we've taken to developing the updated outlook for 20201.  First, we've analyzed our experience and results from March through June to drive forecasts for the balance of the year. Second, our guidance does not assume a recovery for 2020. Third, our overall outlook assumes that we will not be able to run conferences for the balance of the year. We are operationally planning to deliver one day conferences in the fourth quarter in geographies where it is safe and possible. And fourth, we will continue to calibrate our cost reduction programs with our top line results.  Given the second quarter business performance, we've already restored some of the spending we deferred starting in March. We are updating our full year outlook to reflect Q2 performance, cost restoration considerations and, finally, a weaker US dollar compared to when we gave guidance in May.  We now forecast Research revenue, including the FX update, of at least $3.48 billion for the full year. This is growth of about 3% versus 2019 and reflects a continuation of late March and second quarter new business and retention trends through the rest of the year.  While the full second quarter was modestly better than what we saw in late March and April, there are still macro risks to the second half, largely for the non-subscription portion of the segment.  We continue to expect total CV to decelerate through the year. CV changes earlier in the year have a larger impact to full-year Research revenue growth. There's a lag effect on Research revenue, so slower CV growth exiting this year will lead to slower Research revenue growth in 2021.  As we ramp our spending back up to position ourselves for long term success, there will be a short term headwind to margins next year due to a lag between CV and revenue growth. We expect that, in a normal 2022, we will see margins of at least the 16.1% we delivered in 2019.  For the Conferences segment, our guidance is based on not running any conferences for the duration of 2020. This will result in revenue of about $35 million for the full year. We will continue to incur costs in the Conferences business, both cost of services as well as SG&A.  Within the business, we have direct expenses that relate to specific conferences and other expenses that don't. We won't be incurring the direct costs related to specific conferences that are canceled. Wherever possible, we expect to roll forward conference participation by exhibitors and attendees to future conferences.  We now forecast Consulting revenue including the FX update of at least $365 million for the full year or decline of about 7%. The Consulting outlook continues to contemplate a slowdown in labor-based demand and reflects very challenging compares for the contract optimization business through most of the year. The timing of revenue in the contract optimization business can be highly variable, as you know.  Overall, we expect consolidated revenue including the FX update of at least $3.88 billion. That's a reported decline of about 9% versus 2019. Excluding Conferences, we expect revenue growth of 2% versus 2019 on a reported basis.  The cost avoidance programs we put in place in March have allowed us to protect profitability and conserve cash. We have started to resume certain spending as the operating environment appears to at least stabilize and we want to ensure we are well positioned for an economic recovery. The implied operating costs in our outlook are not a new run rate, but reflect planning assumptions for a cautious view of the revenue outlook.  We expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $635 million, which includes $10 million of projected FX benefit. While we are raising our revenue outlook for the full year, we are leaving the EBITDA outlook unchanged before the FX benefit consistent with our comments last quarter. The full-year margin before updating for FX are about 16.3%, up from the 16.1% margins we had in 2019.  We remain committed to full year margins of at least 16.1%. We also want to maintain the flexibility to be able to resume growth hiring and to restore certain expenses we deferred starting in March. These are important for us to accelerate out of the recession and position us to drive CV growth in 2021 and beyond.  As we have discussed, 2021 margins are likely to be down versus 2020 as CV reaccelerates because of the lag between CV and revenue. There may be upside to 2020 EBITDA depending on top line results and the timing and magnitude of our cost restorations. Our weighted average interest rate will increase as we continue to have the run out of our interest rate swaps through the respective maturities. We continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2020.  We expect 2020 adjusted EPS of at least $3.08, including an $0.08 benefit from FX. The lower Q2 tax rate benefit was due to timing.  For 2020, we expect free cash flow of at least $425 million. Our free cash flow of at least $425 million. Our free cash flow guidance reflects both the P&L outlook we just discussed, strong CapEx management and better-than-previously forecasted collections. All of the details of our full-year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site.  Finally, for the third quarter of 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA of about $130 million to $135 million. While we expect revenues to decline sequentially, we expect operating expenses to increase significantly as we begin to restore some of the costs we deferred starting in March.  In summary, we delivered strong financial results in the second quarter despite a very uncertain economic environment. Cash flow was outstanding and we have taken a number of measures to increase our financial flexibility, reduce maturity risk and ensure we have ample liquidity.  We will continue to balance cost avoidance programs with targeted investments and restoration of certain expenses to ensure we are well positioned to rebound when the economy recovers.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now open. \nJeffrey Meuler: I guess the short version of the question is to quantify modestly better [indiscernible]. CV looks pretty good to me. The commentary sounds positive, lots of pockets of good growth. So, just any help kind of reconciling that language with a fairly modest increase to the full year revenue guidance at a point in the year where I would think it's early enough in the year where you'd see the benefits? So, would love any quantification on what modestly better in June means and any other considerations that could be a headwind other than just the generally uncertain environments and, I guess, the point-in-time revenue decline. \nEugene Hall: Hey, Jeff. It's Gene. So, we can't really quantify the difference, but what I'll tell you is, if we look at kind of the performance during the quarter, June was definitely a trend. It was a better selling environment than the previous couple months. And so, that's kind of what we said in our remarks. And I think we can't quantify it any more than that. \nJeffrey Meuler: Any just other kind of reconciliation factors you would provide or just something I'll end up be considering on why the revenue guidance increase looks fairly modest? Maybe it's just the methodology of assuming the late March into Q2 kind of trends continue for the balance of the year. \nCraig Safian: Absolutely. The way I think about it is obviously we have the experience from March and April, which we talked about in the last earnings call. You saw the Q2 experience. And so, what I'd say overall is, from a new business perspective, I think we were modestly better than what we experienced in March and April. When we talked about new business being down in the 20-ish \u2013 down year-over-year around 20%. As you saw, GTS was down 14% and GBS was down 8%. So, new business definitely outperformed our expectations from that perspective.  Retention was a little more challenging than we had seen in March and April. And so, again, we've sort of dialed those two new updates through our exploration skew and normal trending of bookings and new business for the balance of the year.  The one thing I would add, though, is that \u2013 I think I made this comment in the prepared remarks \u2013 there's certainly more risk on the non-subscription pieces of the research business. Obviously, we've got great forward visibility on the subscription run out and feel really good about those numbers. But because of the macroenvironment, there's definitely more uncertainty on the non-subscription pieces. \nJeffrey Meuler: And then last, just GBS, if you'll permit a favorable question about GBS, it's been a while. I guess I was surprised at how resilient it's been and how little it decelerated year-over-year. And I know you've been saying forever that it's a bigger, bigger opportunity than GTS. But I was thinking there's less cost optimization research in the library, less tenured staff, the marketing challenges you're working through. So, I don't know if you were equally surprised by that, but would love any additional color on I guess the relative GBS performance.\nEugene Hall: Basically, we've been saying long, as you mentioned, that the value proposition in GBS is really the same value proposition in GTS, meaning that we identify clients' mission critical priorities and we help them with those mission critical priorities. And every function has priorities that are just as important. They're different by function. Again, you're not worried about cybersecurity and HR, but you may be worried about building a more effective diversity and inclusion program. And it's just as important to the HR leaders. And so, our research is focused on what are the mission critical priorities that these leaders are going to face and helping them to address those mission critical priorities in the best and most cost effective way you can.  That's been kind of what we've been saying all along. And I guess you kind of see it there in terms of what's going on with GBS. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. \nToni Kaplan: Craig, you beat the 2Q EBITDA guide by $30 million and raised the full year by the $10 million FX benefit. And I know you sort of look at things on a full year basis and maybe spending was just a little bit lighter than you thought in 2Q. Is that the reason for why the full year guide wasn't raised by the $30 million? And I guess just in conjunction with that, the ramp down in margin guidance in the second half of the year seems like a lot. So, just help us understand the big ramp down in margins in the second half. \nCraig Safian: The way to sort of read the phasing and what's been going on, obviously, in March and April, when we really didn't know how bad or how deep or how broad the macro impact was going to be from the pandemic, we very quickly put the brakes on lots of spending across the board. And it was the right thing to do. We had to make sure that we were taking a balanced approach towards the balance of year, that we were maintaining liquidity, maintaining flexibility, all that stuff. And so, you really saw that start to flow through primarily in Q2. And some of the Q2 performance or overperformance was driven by revenue being modestly better than expected. And a lot of it was driven by us avoiding more costs than we had initially dialed in.  Where we sit today is trying to find that balance between making sure that we're delivering on our financial commitments and delivering on our EBITDA and other targets, but also making sure that we are investing in the business and restoring expenses that we think are extraordinarily important for us to get through this year and, more importantly, serve as sort of a jumping off point when there is a recovery.  And so, the way to think about the balance of the year is, as an example, in Q2, we weren't immediately backfilling open roles even in certain research or service positions. We've now stabilized ourselves and have good line of sight for the balance of the year. And so, we're backfilling those roles, and we're actually making selective growth hires where we think there's a high possibility for return and payback on that and also starting to restore certain expenses.  And so, we are looking at it on a full year basis, not necessarily on a Q2 versus Q3 basis, but it's largely about, we stabilize the business, and we want to make sure that we are putting back into the business the right costs and targeted spends, so that when there is a macro recovery, we're poised to leap off of that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Bank of America. \nGary Bisbee: Craig, maybe I'll follow up on that last point. So, can you just \u2013 Craig and Gene both, I guess, I should say. Can you help us think about what determines when you bring the cost back on? Is it really demand driven and seeing the near term opportunity for that? And I ask from this perspective. It's commendable given the margin performance of the last few years to maintain the margin target for this year. But I think one might argue given that a lot of investors are looking at this as sort of a throwaway year that if there are opportunities to bring them back this year, even if you were to have margins below that target, but that improved the pace of recovery into next year that that might be a wise decision. So, just how are you thinking about what's the factor that determines when you bring the investment back in business? Thank you. \nEugene Hall: If you think about the way that we have \u2013 Craig described this a bit earlier, which is, we didn't know how bad or how deep the downturn was going to be. So, we put on a pretty hard hiring freeze, very, very selective hiring, everything else frozen, that included research analysts, that included salespeople, product development, et cetera. And so, as we've seen kind of how our performance is and how the market is, we want to make sure we maintain, to your point, the right number of analysts, the right sales capacity, the ability to develop and introduce new products, et cetera.  So, we're basically bringing back that capacity, so that we're very well positioned, especially beginning in 2021 to re accelerate growth. There are some expenses that we don't need to bring back, and that will be like travel expenses. Today, we're lucky, in that as an information services company, we can work with our clients \u2013 we're doing very, very well working with our clients remotely. And so, our travel expenses have dropped dramatically this year. That doesn't hurt our future growth or anything like that. It sort of goes with the environment.  And so, for the things that really affect future growth, like research, sales, product development, that's the places that we are making sure we have the investments in place. And that's reflected in the forecast. For the things that kind of go with the environment like travel or the reductions in our Conferences business, that's the other category. \nCraig Safian: And Gary, I guess the one thing I'd add is, I think we can do both, which is manage for profitability and great free cash flow performance now, and also make sure that we're making those targeted spend, so that when there is a recovery, as Gene and I both mentioned, we're ready to rebound very quickly with it. So, it's not an either/or for us, we think, in this environment. We can do both. \nGary Bisbee: Just to follow-up, on the Conferences business, I think, Gene, you said this remains an important part of Gartner or something to that effect. How are the digital pilots going? Any sort of learnings on how you might monetize that? If we look beyond this year, do you have the ability for a while to get back to the prior conference, whether it's attendance levels or exhibitor performance, or is that is that still a work in progress, figuring out how to monetize digital? \nEugene Hall: So, it's clearly a work in progress. But we've done some pilots, as we've mentioned before. Those went very well in terms of understanding how clients feel about it. And what we found is that attendees still want to go to conferences. And in this environment, virtual, they're very happy to go to. And so, we think we can get really good attendance at conferences.  With exhibitors, one of their best sources of clients is conferences. So, they're very interested in working with us to find ways that work for them as well as the attendees. And I feel very good that we will find some of those things as we experiment throughout the remaining months of the year.  Looking to the future, actually, this whole move to virtual will be good for us because we're kind of seeing that, in the future, there's probably going to be a mix of both in-person and virtual conferences, and we'll develop those virtual conference skills during this period. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.\nWilliam Warmington: So, you've mentioned a couple of times the spending to position for a recovery. I wanted to ask, functionally, from a planning standpoint, what's the timing you're assuming for recovery? Are we thinking third quarter 2021?\nCraig Safian: I'll start and then Gene can follow-up. So, we're not pegging any sort of timing for recovery as it stands right now. We're obviously watching the markets and watching everything going on just like you and everyone else on this call is doing. And so, there's no pinpointed time for recovery that we're planning around. I think what we want to make sure we do is, number one, continue to deliver great value to our clients who do really need us. And so, we don't want to do anything that degrades our ability to do that now. At the same time, we also don't want to make short-term decisions around reducing expenses that impinge upon our ability to actually rebound when there is a recovery. And so, again, what we're talking about now is not specifically when we pivot and when there is a rebound, but really about making sure that we have ample capacity from a selling perspective, from a servicing perspective, from a research analyst perspective, et cetera, so that when there is a rebound, we are poised to take advantage of it. \nWilliam Warmington: And then, the 6% to 7% growth that you're seeing in Research on a combined basis, GTS and GBS for CV, is that a good way to think about the type of CV growth that we can continue to see in this type of an environment until we see the recovery? \nEugene Hall: As we talked about a little bit earlier, we do expect, based on the running out or extrapolating the math that we have seen in the second quarter that CV will continue to decelerate. As we talked about last quarter, based on everything we see today, we don't think it will be anywhere near what we experienced in the last great recession, back a little over a decade ago. But with these sort of trends, we will continue to see, until there is stabilization or recovery, some glide down on the CV growth.  As we talked about, the CV is holding up really, really nicely, both on the GTS and GBS side, both being around 7% for the quarter, but we would expect some continued modest degradation in those CV growth rates if current trends continue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. \nAndrew Nicholas: I was hoping just to follow-up quickly on the Conferences questioning a bit earlier, specifically as it relates to virtual versus in-person conferences. Is there anything you can say about how you're thinking about profitability differences between those two types and whether or not, in 2021 or 2022, to the extent that you get to a situation where you're holding more hybrid type conferences, if those could potentially be as profitable or even more profitable than what you've historically done in the years prior? \nEugene Hall: Andrew, as I said, we're kind of at the early stage with virtual conferences. The pilots have been successful, in the sense that we know that clients will come to them, we know clients \u2013 and the same kind of numbers are larger even than with in-person conferences because you don't have to travel. And we know clients rate them very highly. And we know they're less expensive to hold than destination conferences. In terms of the whole financial equation, we're still figuring that out. And so, I think it would be premature to kind of say we've got that figured out yet. I don't know, Craig, you want to add to that. \nCraig Safian: No, I would have said the same exact thing. \nAndrew Nicholas: And then, in terms of the contract documentation business, obviously, really strong quarter. Just curious how you're thinking about the runway for that business. I know you mentioned that it's highly variable, and that makes sense. But just wondering if, at a high level, you'd expect that to be something that's more of a near term spike or something that can have a runway kind of heading out into next year. Thank you. \nEugene Hall: Well, as you know, our contract authorization business helps our clients save money. And in this kind of environment, there's a lot of interest in being able to save money. So, I think that we're getting \u2013 we're at a very good selling environment for that kind of a product.  Having said that, at any point in time, even when the economy is booming, there's always companies, to their trouble, who want to save money and well-run companies want to save money as well. And so, I'd say I see that business as \u2013 it's a relatively small business in Gartner. It's going to stay relatively small business in Gartner. But I do think it will grow along with the rest of the company. \nCraig Safian: I would add one point. That business performed very well last year. So, there are tough compares in the back half of the year, but I would echo everything Gene said about the great value that it provides to clients in any sort of economic situation, but particularly in this one. Yeah, there's definitely real value there for clients. But again, tough compares in the second half of the year for that business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from being BMO Capital Markets. \nJeffrey Silber: I know it's tough to give guidance in this environment, but you did give us some color for the rest of the year. So, we do appreciate it. But if we keep on going at current trends and assumed you hit the guidance for the year, when do you think you'd hit the bottom in terms of CV growth and roughly what rate would that be? \nCraig Safian: You're right. It is tough to guide in this environment. So, thanks for the prelude there. So, we don't guide on contract value. And we're not changing that policy now. I think the way to sort of think about it is we're obviously now comparing our business trends to what was a normal year a year ago, first half of 2019 and second half of 2019.  So, if the economy doesn't recover or we don't see broad-based recoveries around the world, when we get into 2021, we're now comparing to pandemic-impacted results. And so, you would expect, at that point, if we continue at current course and speed with sort of \u2013 this sort of retention result and this sort of new business pacing that the contract value growth would stabilize. I'm not going to peg a number where we think that is, as we've talked about. We do believe that, based on everything we're seeing, the trough is a lot higher than it was during the last downturn for us. But that's as close as you're going to get us sort of pegging a number on it.  But, again, I think the thing that, as we look at the business, and it is tough out there, but our teams are doing a really fantastic job of sort of cutting through the tougher selling environment. And the sheer volume of new business that we're writing is really great. Yes, it's less than we did a year ago, but we're bringing on new logos, we're growing accounts, we're adding new seats, we're adding new subscriptions, doing that across the board. And so, again, I think if we have another 12 months of this, you would see the CV growth stabilize because we'd be comparing to a similarly impacted period when we get 12 months from now. \nJeffrey Silber: I'm going to stick out a little further and talk about 2021 since you kind of opened up the discussion. You had mentioned, given the rate of CV growth and the lagged impact, that we'd see some sort of margin decline in 2021. Again, just assuming you kind of hit your guidance at the end of the year, what kind of magnitude are we talking about? What would the impact be next year? \nCraig Safian: So, Jeff, we're not going to guide for next year. All we're saying is, we would expect when there is an economic recovery for our CV to rebound. And as you know, there's a lag between when that revenue comes, and so we're going to make sure that we scale our business and invest in core things in relation to the contract value, not necessarily the accounting revenue run out. And so, in doing that, that can create some us margin headwinds. That's what we're really saying about 2021. We fully expect to recover, we fully expect to return to growth. But because of the lag in the revenue recognition on the subscription based business, we could see some modest margin headwinds. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. \nManav Patnaik: I just wanted to ask if you could help us just break down GTS productivity a bit more. It's obviously been getting incrementally worse by the quarter. And this quarter obviously was down quite a bit as you've reported. But just curious, how much of that was more one time type roadblocks versus improvements? Gene, you talked about client activity is good and so forth. Can you just help how we should assume that should start trending up?\nEugene Hall: Let me give you a little color around it. So, if I think about GTS, the kind of deceleration that's going on, there's different components of it. One is that we sell new enterprises. There's clients that have never been a client of Gartner. That amount of business actually is about, for GTS, about the same year-over-year. So, we're not just seeing a deceleration in our ability to sell to new enterprises who've never been with Gartner.  We saw about a third of the deceleration is from enterprises that left Gartner. They used to be with us and they left us. Another third is from enterprises that stay with us, but historically have grown, but they didn't grow. So, it looks like deceleration because instead of buying another seat or two, they actually stayed flat. Whereas in past years, that's a significant part of growth. And the last third is clients who might have four seats and they go to a less expensive \u2013 looking for seats, but use a less expensive seat. So, downgrade. So, going from one seat that had a higher service level to a lower service level.  And so, what we're really seeing is new business with clients with new enterprises flat year-over-year. A little uptick in lost enterprises, which is about a third of the difference if you look at CD growth. And then, the other two-thirds from existing clients not growing that would have grown before or from clients that are still with us, same number of seats, but choose, for one of the seats, a lower service level, which obviously looks like a reduction in CV.  And my interpretation of it is people see a lot of value. Most of the deceleration is not due to clients leaving us. In a tough environment, people make tough choices and sort of say, 'hey, I have four seats, I want to keep my four seats, but let's take one to a little lower service level,' et cetera. And so, that kind of gives you a little color in terms of what's going on under the covers.  So, it would be wrong to think that our clients are leaving us more than they did before. There's some of that, and that's not the biggest piece of it. The biggest piece is we're not getting the upgrades, the growth we would have gotten from additional seats with existing clients.  And secondly, some clients are \u2013 rather than giving up seats, downgrading the service level, but keeping the seats because the value they see.\nManav Patnaik: And I guess, that one third/two thirds mix, that's more on the new business side, right? I guess, maybe if I could just ask, down 47% productivity like, how should that start picking back up? Like, was there just one-time distraction because of it being the April/May time period? \nEugene Hall: The numbers I was giving were not about new business per se. It was about the change in CV growth. So, it incorporates both existing and new business. If somebody chooses a lower price seat, that's a lower dollar retention. \nManav Patnaik: And then, so maybe if I can just ask \u2013 Craig, in the Research business, the non-subscription revenue, can you just remind us how much that is and what that decline has been so far? \nCraig Safian: So, within the Research segment, about 10% of the research revenue, roughly, falls into the non-subscription category. And that is made up of a couple of different revenue lines. One is our online businesses, Capterra, Software Advice and GetApp. And then, there's some other non-subscription type research services that fall into that category as well.  Last quarter, we talked about an expectation that that would be down about 10% to 15% year-over-year. That's sort of what the implied guide reflects as well for the balance of the year for those businesses. And so, about 10% of research revenue and down about 10% to 15% for the balance of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. \nGeorge Tong: Your GTS sales force account has declined 3.7%. And your GBS sales force account declined 9.2%. Can you provide more detail around your outlook for sales force hiring between these two segments and where you see headcount growth coming back faster? \nCraig Safian: Let me cover the numbers and then Gene can talk about the strategy and how we're thinking about headcount growth. So, a couple points, and I'll cover first GTS and then GBS.  So, with GTS, as you mentioned, headcount growth is down about 4% year-over-year. Our intention for the balance of the year is to get that number back up well over 3,100 frontline quota-bearing people. So, we expect to exit the year over 3,100 people, which would put us down a little bit on a year-over-year basis. And part of the reason why it's not up necessarily or I would say optically is down is we actually exited 2019 with a pretty significant bench. So, people on our payroll, who were either in training or had just graduated from training, who weren't yet in territory, and over the first six months of the year, the team did a really good job of making sure we got all those people deployed. And so, our selling capacity is actually in pretty good shape because we've now deployed that bench and have them out there on the frontline selling. And so, we'd expect our year-over-year headcount growth to be down modestly, our year-over-year, as we exit 2020. But from a selling capacity perspective, we feel in pretty good shape. From a GBS perspective, we hit the brakes there hard. We did a lot of work around territory optimization, and we also froze hiring there when we were doing our cost avoidance and cost reduction programs. Our expectation is to get back to about flat for the full year for GBS. And so, while down 9% year-over-year now, we would expect to end 2020 in roughly where we ended 2019, which was \u2013 we ended 2019 with 869. So, think in that neighborhood is our target for where we want to end from GBS headcount perspective.  Gene, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that. \nEugene Hall: That did it well. \nGeorge Tong: And then, to follow-up, on GBS, you mentioned a little bit of softness on the marketing side. Can you elaborate on any other one-time factors that could have impacted performance on the GBS CV performance, either to the positive or to the negative? \nCraig Safian: So, the marketing is something we obviously \u2013 we knew about and told everyone as we were exiting 2019 to expect it. So, that's sort of the one-time headwind that we knew about and are dealing with. And again, the goal of it is to improve the profitability of that business in a normal environment. And we're well on the way to being able to do that.  I wouldn't call out any one-time benefits. I think that the team has done a really, really good job of, again, fighting through the tougher selling environment, with GBS new business only being down 8% year-over-year, I think was really strong relative performance for that business.  We called out the fact that every major function is contributing to the overall seat growth, with the exception of marketing, which we just talked about. And so, the business is performing pretty well.  And, again, as Gene elaborated, I think with the first question, it's because the value proposition is consistent with what we've done forever from a GTS perspective. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamza. Just within the Consulting business, I just wanted to know what lines of work you think are seeing better demand versus others? And how do you think COVID is impacting the sales cycle? As you get into July, are you seeing customer decision making getting pulled forward due to need for your service or are they still delaying out of caution? \nEugene Hall: So, first, I'd say that, in this environment, decision cycles are definitely longer than they were a year ago and we definitely see that. So, I would say there's less demand, so there are longer decision cycles because there's often another review. Like, for example, maybe the CIO made the decision before and now it's got to go to the CFO. And that may take another two weeks or 30 days to actually get a decision done.  And we're seeing demand in areas you'd expect. So, it's things like cost optimization, building a digital business, things like that. \nGeorge Tong: And then, looking at sales force productivity, could you give us a sense of what the productivity looks like regionally? Are you seeing any variations with lockdowns? Or has it been pretty consistent across the country as many businesses have still been operating in more of this work from home environment? \nEugene Hall: So, so there's clearly been both an industry and geography aspect of this. Craig went through some of the numbers earlier in terms of our overall business. We're seeing good overall demand. But as you can expect, there's tougher selling environments. If you're selling into some aspect of the travel business, so many of those companies are hit very hard and they're still buying from us, but it's a much tougher selling environment than it was a year ago. \nOperator: At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Gene Hall for closing remarks. \nEugene Hall: So, as you heard today, excluding the impact of Conferences, our company revenues were strong. We have an unparalleled value proposition across all major enterprise functions. Our clients are facing more disruptive change than ever before. And Gartner is the best source for the cost effective, relevant insights that empower leaders to succeed amid ongoing uncertainty.  We continue to have an advanced untapped market opportunity and we know the right things to do to capture that opportunity in thriving or uncertain times.  Looking ahead, we expect to come out of this recession strong and well positioned to drive long-term sustained double-digit growth in revenues, earnings and free cash flow for years to come.  Thanks again for joining us. And I look forward to updating you again next quarter. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eugene Hall",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. The COVID-19 pandemic will have a permanent and dramatic impact on business, leadership and society. Leaders face more simultaneous challenges than ever before \u2013 health and safety risks, sustained macroeconomic dislocations, shifting customer expectations, regulatory changes, combating racism and strengthening social justice, cybersecurity risks and more. Gartner is the best source of the timely and relevant insights, advice and tools that empower leaders across every major enterprise function to achieve success with their mission critical priorities.  With our forward-looking research and our ability to be agile in supporting our clients through ongoing uncertainty, demand for analyst interactions is up almost 30% year-over-year. Clients and non-clients alike continue to leverage our Coronavirus Resource Center as we plan for the reset.  With the challenging macroeconomic conditions, we're seeing an uptick in leaders accessing our cost optimization content. And with the ongoing fight for social justice, we're seeing significant engagement with our diversity, equity and inclusion resource center. This resource center aggregates much of our broadly relevant HR insights on diversity, inclusion and engagement, along with critical tools and webinars and makes them publicly accessible.  We recently reinforced our own commitment to diversity, inclusion and social equity. Consistent with our research advice to clients, we increased the level of programming engagement of our employee resource groups \u2013 women, pride, mosaic, and veterans at Gartner.  We reinstated our charity match program to empower our associates to have even greater impact through the organizations they choose. We established a cross functional executive council on diversity and inclusion and we published our corporate social responsibility report outlying actions we've taken to improve our operations and support our clients.  Gartner remains strong as we continue navigating global uncertainties. Our second quarter results reflect our unique value proposition across all major functions of the enterprise.  I'll share a few highlights and Craig will give you the full details in a moment. For the second quarter of 2020, total revenues were down 8% year-over-year. However, excluding the impact of our Conferences business, revenues were up 6% year-over-year, and we drew improvements in EBITDA and free cash flow was up 71%.  We continue to calibrate our cost reduction programs. We strategically paused spending in March to protect profitability and conserve cash. We've restored some of the spend in targeted areas. We remain committed to full-year margins of at least 16.1%.  Research, our largest and most profitable segment, is the core of our value proposition. We continue to make a significant global impact through our Research business.  Total Research revenues were up 8% over this time last year. And while the selling front remains challenging, we did see modestly better trends in June than in the first two months of the quarter. Global technology sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS represents more than 80% of our total Research contract value. Global business sales, or GPS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT, including HR, finance, legal, sales, supply chain, marketing and more. GBS represents about 20% of our total Research contract value. In the second quarter 2020, both GTS and GBS drove similar contract value growth performances of around 7%. In GTS, we saw strong performances across many regions and sectors, including countries in Asia, Latin America and Europe and industries including retail, services and technology. In GBS, year-over-year contract value was up across every practice area except marketing.  As I mentioned last quarter, our Conferences segment was significantly impacted by COVID-19. Because of government mandates and health concerns, we were unable to hold any destination conferences during Q2.  To prioritize the health and safety of our attendees, partners and associates, we have decided to cancel our in-person conferences for the remainder of 2020 and pivot a subset of these conferences to a virtual format.  Gartner Virtual Conferences will provide attendees a flexible way to gain unparalleled insights and advice and accelerate their learning without the need to travel. We'll monetize these conferences as we perfect the virtual format. Look to the long term, we expect the future as a combination of in-person and virtual conferences. We continue to expect Conferences will be an important contributor to our overall business.  Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research and provides clients with a deeper level of involvement through extended project based work to help them execute their most strategic initiatives.  Consulting revenues were down year-over-year in Q2, but we had strong results in contract optimization.  In summary, we continue to have a strong value proposition across all major enterprise functions. Our clients are facing more disruptive change than ever before. And Gartner is the best source for the cost effective, relevant insights that will empower leaders to succeed amid ongoing uncertainty.  We continue to have a vast untapped market opportunity. We know the right things to do to capture that opportunity in thriving or uncertain times.  Looking ahead, we expect to come out of this recession strong and well positioned to drive long term, sustained, double-digit growth in revenues, earnings and free cash flow for years to come.  With that, I'll hand the call over to our CFO, Craig Safian. Hey, Jeff. It's Gene. So, we can't really quantify the difference, but what I'll tell you is, if we look at kind of the performance during the quarter, June was definitely a trend. It was a better selling environment than the previous couple months. And so, that's kind of what we said in our remarks. And I think we can't quantify it any more than that. Basically, we've been saying long, as you mentioned, that the value proposition in GBS is really the same value proposition in GTS, meaning that we identify clients' mission critical priorities and we help them with those mission critical priorities. And every function has priorities that are just as important. They're different by function. Again, you're not worried about cybersecurity and HR, but you may be worried about building a more effective diversity and inclusion program. And it's just as important to the HR leaders. And so, our research is focused on what are the mission critical priorities that these leaders are going to face and helping them to address those mission critical priorities in the best and most cost effective way you can.  That's been kind of what we've been saying all along. And I guess you kind of see it there in terms of what's going on with GBS. If you think about the way that we have \u2013 Craig described this a bit earlier, which is, we didn't know how bad or how deep the downturn was going to be. So, we put on a pretty hard hiring freeze, very, very selective hiring, everything else frozen, that included research analysts, that included salespeople, product development, et cetera. And so, as we've seen kind of how our performance is and how the market is, we want to make sure we maintain, to your point, the right number of analysts, the right sales capacity, the ability to develop and introduce new products, et cetera.  So, we're basically bringing back that capacity, so that we're very well positioned, especially beginning in 2021 to re accelerate growth. There are some expenses that we don't need to bring back, and that will be like travel expenses. Today, we're lucky, in that as an information services company, we can work with our clients \u2013 we're doing very, very well working with our clients remotely. And so, our travel expenses have dropped dramatically this year. That doesn't hurt our future growth or anything like that. It sort of goes with the environment.  And so, for the things that really affect future growth, like research, sales, product development, that's the places that we are making sure we have the investments in place. And that's reflected in the forecast. For the things that kind of go with the environment like travel or the reductions in our Conferences business, that's the other category. So, it's clearly a work in progress. But we've done some pilots, as we've mentioned before. Those went very well in terms of understanding how clients feel about it. And what we found is that attendees still want to go to conferences. And in this environment, virtual, they're very happy to go to. And so, we think we can get really good attendance at conferences.  With exhibitors, one of their best sources of clients is conferences. So, they're very interested in working with us to find ways that work for them as well as the attendees. And I feel very good that we will find some of those things as we experiment throughout the remaining months of the year.  Looking to the future, actually, this whole move to virtual will be good for us because we're kind of seeing that, in the future, there's probably going to be a mix of both in-person and virtual conferences, and we'll develop those virtual conference skills during this period. As we talked about a little bit earlier, we do expect, based on the running out or extrapolating the math that we have seen in the second quarter that CV will continue to decelerate. As we talked about last quarter, based on everything we see today, we don't think it will be anywhere near what we experienced in the last great recession, back a little over a decade ago. But with these sort of trends, we will continue to see, until there is stabilization or recovery, some glide down on the CV growth.  As we talked about, the CV is holding up really, really nicely, both on the GTS and GBS side, both being around 7% for the quarter, but we would expect some continued modest degradation in those CV growth rates if current trends continue. Andrew, as I said, we're kind of at the early stage with virtual conferences. The pilots have been successful, in the sense that we know that clients will come to them, we know clients \u2013 and the same kind of numbers are larger even than with in-person conferences because you don't have to travel. And we know clients rate them very highly. And we know they're less expensive to hold than destination conferences. In terms of the whole financial equation, we're still figuring that out. And so, I think it would be premature to kind of say we've got that figured out yet. I don't know, Craig, you want to add to that. Well, as you know, our contract authorization business helps our clients save money. And in this kind of environment, there's a lot of interest in being able to save money. So, I think that we're getting \u2013 we're at a very good selling environment for that kind of a product.  Having said that, at any point in time, even when the economy is booming, there's always companies, to their trouble, who want to save money and well-run companies want to save money as well. And so, I'd say I see that business as \u2013 it's a relatively small business in Gartner. It's going to stay relatively small business in Gartner. But I do think it will grow along with the rest of the company. Let me give you a little color around it. So, if I think about GTS, the kind of deceleration that's going on, there's different components of it. One is that we sell new enterprises. There's clients that have never been a client of Gartner. That amount of business actually is about, for GTS, about the same year-over-year. So, we're not just seeing a deceleration in our ability to sell to new enterprises who've never been with Gartner.  We saw about a third of the deceleration is from enterprises that left Gartner. They used to be with us and they left us. Another third is from enterprises that stay with us, but historically have grown, but they didn't grow. So, it looks like deceleration because instead of buying another seat or two, they actually stayed flat. Whereas in past years, that's a significant part of growth. And the last third is clients who might have four seats and they go to a less expensive \u2013 looking for seats, but use a less expensive seat. So, downgrade. So, going from one seat that had a higher service level to a lower service level.  And so, what we're really seeing is new business with clients with new enterprises flat year-over-year. A little uptick in lost enterprises, which is about a third of the difference if you look at CD growth. And then, the other two-thirds from existing clients not growing that would have grown before or from clients that are still with us, same number of seats, but choose, for one of the seats, a lower service level, which obviously looks like a reduction in CV.  And my interpretation of it is people see a lot of value. Most of the deceleration is not due to clients leaving us. In a tough environment, people make tough choices and sort of say, 'hey, I have four seats, I want to keep my four seats, but let's take one to a little lower service level,' et cetera. And so, that kind of gives you a little color in terms of what's going on under the covers.  So, it would be wrong to think that our clients are leaving us more than they did before. There's some of that, and that's not the biggest piece of it. The biggest piece is we're not getting the upgrades, the growth we would have gotten from additional seats with existing clients.  And secondly, some clients are \u2013 rather than giving up seats, downgrading the service level, but keeping the seats because the value they see. The numbers I was giving were not about new business per se. It was about the change in CV growth. So, it incorporates both existing and new business. If somebody chooses a lower price seat, that's a lower dollar retention. That did it well. So, first, I'd say that, in this environment, decision cycles are definitely longer than they were a year ago and we definitely see that. So, I would say there's less demand, so there are longer decision cycles because there's often another review. Like, for example, maybe the CIO made the decision before and now it's got to go to the CFO. And that may take another two weeks or 30 days to actually get a decision done.

            "content": "Thank you, Gene. And good morning, everyone. I hope everyone remains safe and well.  Second quarter results were ahead of our expectations due to a modestly better demand environment and strong cost management execution. We had a successful bond offering during the quarter which allowed us to reduce maturity risk without increasing our annual cash interest costs this year.  As we've gotten more clarity on the economy and gauged our business performance over the past several months, we've resumed backfilling roles and making selective growth hires. While we continue to manage our costs carefully, we remain focused on positioning ourselves to rebound strongly when the economy recovers.  Second quarter revenue was $973 million, down 9% as reported and down 8% FX neutral. Excluding Conferences, our revenues were up 6% year-over-year FX neutral.  In addition, contribution margin was 67%, up more than 300 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $192 million, up 4% year-over-year and up 6% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $1.20 cents and free cash flow in the quarter was a very strong $322 million. Research revenue in the second quarter grew 6% year-over-year on a reported basis and 8% on an FX neutral basis. Second quarter research contribution margin was 72%, benefiting in part from the temporary cost avoidance initiatives we put in place last quarter. As the macroenvironment improves, we will take a balanced approach to resuming growth spending and incenting our associates who are the core of our business.  Total contract value was $3.4 billion at June 30, representing FX neutral growth of 7% versus the prior year. Global technology sales contract value at the end of the second quarter was $2.8 billion, up 7% versus the prior year.  The more challenging selling environment that began in March continued in the second quarter and had an impact on most of our reported metrics.  Client retention for GTS was 80%, down about 260 basis points year-over-year, while retention for GTS was 100% for the quarter, down about 470 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business declined 14% versus last year. We ended the second quarter with 12,381 GTS enterprises, down slightly from last year.  The average contract value per enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at $223,000 per enterprise in GTS, up 10% year-over-year. Growth and CV per enterprise reflects the combination of upsell, increased number of subscriptions and price.  At the end of the second quarter, we had 3,089 quota-bearing associates in GTS or a decline of 4% year-over-year. We expect to end 2020 with more than 3,100 quota-bearing associates, a slight decline from the end of 2019. We entered this year with a large bench which we have now fully deployed.  For GTS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning period quota-bearing headcount was $58,000 per salesperson, down 48% versus the second quarter of last year. Despite the challenging macroenvironment, GTS CV grew in nearly all of our 10 largest countries and was up double digits in Brazil, Japan, France and the Netherlands. CV grew across all sectors except for transportation, which was down modestly.  The smallest enterprises we serve saw double-digit CV growth through the strong efforts of our mid-sized enterprise sales teams. Across our entire GTS sales team, we sold significant amounts of new business in the quarter, to both existing and new clients. New logos continued to be a significant contributor to our CV growth.  Finally, despite some net churn in clients, we continue to see increased spending by retained clients on average. This speaks to the compelling client value proposition we offer in both strong and challenging economic environments.  Global business sales contract value was $643 million at the end of the second quarter. That's about 20% of our total contract value. CV growth was 7% year-over-year as reported and 6% on an organic basis. CV growth in the quarter was led by supply chain and the human resources practice. All practices positively contributed to the 7% CV growth rate for GBS, with the exception of marketing. GxL CV grew 40% to $319 million and legacy CV declined 14% year-over-year to $324 million. Total GBS new business was $36 million in the quarter, down 8%. However, we saw strong new business in our finance and sales practices.  As we've discussed the last two quarters, in the marketing practice, we are transitioning away from some lower margin products. This has created short-term headwinds, but is expected to improve profitability in a normal environment. Because GxL will comprise the majority of GBS CV, starting next quarter, we will be reporting total GBS only. In the second quarter, total GxL new business was $31 million, while legacy new business was $5 million. Also in the second quarter, GxL attrition was $19 million and legacy attrition was $20 million. GxL retention performance year-over-year was consistent with GTS. Client retention for GBS was 83%, up about 170 basis points year-over-year, while retention for GBS was 100% for the quarter, up about 520 basis points year-over-year. We ended the second quarter with 4,789 GBS enterprises, down about 7% from last year. The average contract value per enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at $134,000 per enterprise in GBS, up 15% year-over-year.  Growth in CV per enterprise reflects upsell and increased number of subscriptions and price. Despite the pandemic, our retained clients are continuing to spend more with us every year.  At the end of the second quarter, we had 834 quota-bearing associates of GBS, down 9% year-over-year. Headcount was down sequentially and year-over-year as we optimized our territories and then temporarily froze hiring as part of our cost avoidance program. We now expect to end 2020 with roughly flat headcount to the end of 2019 in GBS. For GBS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning-period quota-bearing headcount was $43,000 per salesperson, up from last year.  As you know, the Conferences segment has been materially impacted by the global pandemic. We have canceled all destination conferences for the remainder of 2020. We are pivoting to producing virtual conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver for our clients. We held three virtual conferences in the second quarter, which were used as pilots for the rest of the year. We also held a number of our one-day local conferences with a virtual format.  We expect our local conferences business to rebound faster than the destination conferences given the smaller size of the gatherings, no need for travel and strong relationships and sense of community among the participants.  With the cancellation of the fourth quarter destination conferences, unfortunately, we had to reduce the number of associates in the business. We continue to incur costs both in cost of services and SG&A to support the virtual conferences and to be in a position to resume in-person conferences when it is safe and permitted. The second quarter is a reasonable run rate for how to think about conferences costs for the rest of the year.  I also wanted to provide you with an update on potential termination or sunk costs on canceled conferences as well as situation with our event cancellation insurance. We expect to recover the majority of sunk and potential termination costs for future conferences through either force majeure clauses in our vendor contracts, other arrangements with vendors or event cancellation insurance claims.  Timing of receiving insurance claims is uncertain, so we will not record any recoveries in excess of expenses incurred until the receipt of the insurance proceeds. Our guidance for 2020 continues to assume no conferences will be held for the remainder of the year.  Second quarter consulting revenues decreased by 6% year-over-year to $97 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues declined 5%. Consulting contribution margin was 34% in the second quarter, up over 130 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. Margins were up due to favorable mix and cost reduction actions.  Labor base revenues were $69 million, down 13% versus Q2 of last year or 12% on an FX neutral basis. Labor base billable headcount of 796 was up 3%. Utilization was 59%.  Backlog at June 30 was $99 million, down 10% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis. Our backlog provides us with about four-and-a-half months of forward revenue coverage.  We had a small workforce action in the Consulting business in the second quarter to better align our billable headcount with our revenue outlook for the balance of the year.  Our Consulting business is seeing demand in three broad areas \u2013 digital, cost optimization, and data and analytics. Demand in digital spans several areas, including digital strategy, digital talent and digital workplace. Cost optimization also spans several areas such as sourcing and vendor management, infrastructure and operations, and application rationalization.  Our contract optimization business, which is a part of our broader cost optimization offerings, had a strong quarter. Revenues were up 17% on a reported basis versus the prior-year quarter. As we've detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable and we face continuing tough compares as we move through the year.  SG&A decreased 4% year-over-year in the second quarter and 2% on an FX neutral basis as the cost avoidance initiatives we put in place last quarter continued to generate savings. SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased in the quarter, driven by recognition of commissions from canceled conferences and severance.  EBITDA for the second quarter was $192 million, up 4% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 6% FX neutral as we offset loss conference margins with significant cost avoidance and cost reductions.  Depreciation in the quarter was approximately $3 million from last year, although about flat with the first quarter as a result of additional office space that had gone into service before the pandemic hit. Amortization was about flat sequentially.  Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs, in the quarter was $27 million, up from $23 million in the second quarter of 2019. Net interest expense is up because we had higher debt balances in the quarter and our interest rate swaps had higher fixed rates than the ones which expired last year.  The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 15.3% for the quarter. The tax rate used for the items used to adjust net income was 22.8% in the quarter.  The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was affected positively as expected by an intercompany sale of intellectual property which resulted in a material favorable impact on the adjusted tax rate. This benefit was already reflected in our full year guidance.  Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $1.20 cents.  As a reminder, last quarter, we updated the definition we use for free cash flow to be cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, and we will no longer be adding back adjustments or non-recurring items. This free cash flow definition provides a measure that reflects cash available for capital allocation, like debt repayment and share repurchases.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $343 million compared to $227 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by cost avoidance initiatives and lower tax payments.  CapEx for the quarter was $21 million, down 46% year-over-year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $322 million, which is up 71% versus the prior year. This includes outflows of about $10 million of acquisition, integration and other non-recurring items.  Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 13% on a rolling four quarter basis, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow as a percent of GAAP net income was about 230%.  During quarter, we issued $800 million of new senior unsecured notes with a 4.5% coupon. We use the proceeds from the notes along with $200 million of balance sheet cash to repay $1 billion of debt on a revolver and term loan A during March 2022. We reduced maturity risk while providing more financial flexibility at a relatively low cost.  Our June 30 debt balance was $2 billion. Our total debt covenant leverage ratio was 2.8 times at the end of the second quarter, well within the 5 times covenant limit. Our other financial covenants are also well within compliance levels.  At the end of the second quarter, we had $357 million of cash. As we discussed last quarter, we paused our share repurchase activity. As we get increased clarity on how the pandemic and economic downturn will play out, we will deploy excess cash for debt repayment, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. We also have about $1.2 billion of revolver capacity.  In addition to our strong cash position, balance sheet flexibility and access to capital, we have taken steps to align our cost with our revenue, allowing us to continue to generate positive free cash flow.  Going into the current situation, we had already built a plan for 2020 that aligned cost growth with revenue growth. As we outlined last quarter, we took additional steps to ensure our long-term financial health and operational Excellence through a number of cost avoidance initiatives.  These decisive actions helped ensure our ongoing financial flexibility in this challenging and uncertain environment without compromising on the quality of the insight, advice and service we provide to our clients. We remain well positioned to reaccelerate and drive future growth once the timing of the economic recovery from this pandemic becomes more evident.  Before I go through the outlook assumptions for each segment, I'll review the overall approach we've taken to developing the updated outlook for 20201.  First, we've analyzed our experience and results from March through June to drive forecasts for the balance of the year. Second, our guidance does not assume a recovery for 2020. Third, our overall outlook assumes that we will not be able to run conferences for the balance of the year. We are operationally planning to deliver one day conferences in the fourth quarter in geographies where it is safe and possible. And fourth, we will continue to calibrate our cost reduction programs with our top line results.  Given the second quarter business performance, we've already restored some of the spending we deferred starting in March. We are updating our full year outlook to reflect Q2 performance, cost restoration considerations and, finally, a weaker US dollar compared to when we gave guidance in May.  We now forecast Research revenue, including the FX update, of at least $3.48 billion for the full year. This is growth of about 3% versus 2019 and reflects a continuation of late March and second quarter new business and retention trends through the rest of the year.  While the full second quarter was modestly better than what we saw in late March and April, there are still macro risks to the second half, largely for the non-subscription portion of the segment.  We continue to expect total CV to decelerate through the year. CV changes earlier in the year have a larger impact to full-year Research revenue growth. There's a lag effect on Research revenue, so slower CV growth exiting this year will lead to slower Research revenue growth in 2021.  As we ramp our spending back up to position ourselves for long term success, there will be a short term headwind to margins next year due to a lag between CV and revenue growth. We expect that, in a normal 2022, we will see margins of at least the 16.1% we delivered in 2019.  For the Conferences segment, our guidance is based on not running any conferences for the duration of 2020. This will result in revenue of about $35 million for the full year. We will continue to incur costs in the Conferences business, both cost of services as well as SG&A.  Within the business, we have direct expenses that relate to specific conferences and other expenses that don't. We won't be incurring the direct costs related to specific conferences that are canceled. Wherever possible, we expect to roll forward conference participation by exhibitors and attendees to future conferences.  We now forecast Consulting revenue including the FX update of at least $365 million for the full year or decline of about 7%. The Consulting outlook continues to contemplate a slowdown in labor-based demand and reflects very challenging compares for the contract optimization business through most of the year. The timing of revenue in the contract optimization business can be highly variable, as you know.  Overall, we expect consolidated revenue including the FX update of at least $3.88 billion. That's a reported decline of about 9% versus 2019. Excluding Conferences, we expect revenue growth of 2% versus 2019 on a reported basis.  The cost avoidance programs we put in place in March have allowed us to protect profitability and conserve cash. We have started to resume certain spending as the operating environment appears to at least stabilize and we want to ensure we are well positioned for an economic recovery. The implied operating costs in our outlook are not a new run rate, but reflect planning assumptions for a cautious view of the revenue outlook.  We expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $635 million, which includes $10 million of projected FX benefit. While we are raising our revenue outlook for the full year, we are leaving the EBITDA outlook unchanged before the FX benefit consistent with our comments last quarter. The full-year margin before updating for FX are about 16.3%, up from the 16.1% margins we had in 2019.  We remain committed to full year margins of at least 16.1%. We also want to maintain the flexibility to be able to resume growth hiring and to restore certain expenses we deferred starting in March. These are important for us to accelerate out of the recession and position us to drive CV growth in 2021 and beyond.  As we have discussed, 2021 margins are likely to be down versus 2020 as CV reaccelerates because of the lag between CV and revenue. There may be upside to 2020 EBITDA depending on top line results and the timing and magnitude of our cost restorations. Our weighted average interest rate will increase as we continue to have the run out of our interest rate swaps through the respective maturities. We continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2020.  We expect 2020 adjusted EPS of at least $3.08, including an $0.08 benefit from FX. The lower Q2 tax rate benefit was due to timing.  For 2020, we expect free cash flow of at least $425 million. Our free cash flow of at least $425 million. Our free cash flow guidance reflects both the P&L outlook we just discussed, strong CapEx management and better-than-previously forecasted collections. All of the details of our full-year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site.  Finally, for the third quarter of 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA of about $130 million to $135 million. While we expect revenues to decline sequentially, we expect operating expenses to increase significantly as we begin to restore some of the costs we deferred starting in March.  In summary, we delivered strong financial results in the second quarter despite a very uncertain economic environment. Cash flow was outstanding and we have taken a number of measures to increase our financial flexibility, reduce maturity risk and ensure we have ample liquidity.  We will continue to balance cost avoidance programs with targeted investments and restoration of certain expenses to ensure we are well positioned to rebound when the economy recovers.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Absolutely. The way I think about it is obviously we have the experience from March and April, which we talked about in the last earnings call. You saw the Q2 experience. And so, what I'd say overall is, from a new business perspective, I think we were modestly better than what we experienced in March and April. When we talked about new business being down in the 20-ish \u2013 down year-over-year around 20%. As you saw, GTS was down 14% and GBS was down 8%. So, new business definitely outperformed our expectations from that perspective.  Retention was a little more challenging than we had seen in March and April. And so, again, we've sort of dialed those two new updates through our exploration skew and normal trending of bookings and new business for the balance of the year.  The one thing I would add, though, is that \u2013 I think I made this comment in the prepared remarks \u2013 there's certainly more risk on the non-subscription pieces of the research business. Obviously, we've got great forward visibility on the subscription run out and feel really good about those numbers. But because of the macroenvironment, there's definitely more uncertainty on the non-subscription pieces. The way to sort of read the phasing and what's been going on, obviously, in March and April, when we really didn't know how bad or how deep or how broad the macro impact was going to be from the pandemic, we very quickly put the brakes on lots of spending across the board. And it was the right thing to do. We had to make sure that we were taking a balanced approach towards the balance of year, that we were maintaining liquidity, maintaining flexibility, all that stuff. And so, you really saw that start to flow through primarily in Q2. And some of the Q2 performance or overperformance was driven by revenue being modestly better than expected. And a lot of it was driven by us avoiding more costs than we had initially dialed in.  Where we sit today is trying to find that balance between making sure that we're delivering on our financial commitments and delivering on our EBITDA and other targets, but also making sure that we are investing in the business and restoring expenses that we think are extraordinarily important for us to get through this year and, more importantly, serve as sort of a jumping off point when there is a recovery.  And so, the way to think about the balance of the year is, as an example, in Q2, we weren't immediately backfilling open roles even in certain research or service positions. We've now stabilized ourselves and have good line of sight for the balance of the year. And so, we're backfilling those roles, and we're actually making selective growth hires where we think there's a high possibility for return and payback on that and also starting to restore certain expenses.  And so, we are looking at it on a full year basis, not necessarily on a Q2 versus Q3 basis, but it's largely about, we stabilize the business, and we want to make sure that we are putting back into the business the right costs and targeted spends, so that when there is a macro recovery, we're poised to leap off of that. And Gary, I guess the one thing I'd add is, I think we can do both, which is manage for profitability and great free cash flow performance now, and also make sure that we're making those targeted spend, so that when there is a recovery, as Gene and I both mentioned, we're ready to rebound very quickly with it. So, it's not an either/or for us, we think, in this environment. We can do both. I'll start and then Gene can follow-up. So, we're not pegging any sort of timing for recovery as it stands right now. We're obviously watching the markets and watching everything going on just like you and everyone else on this call is doing. And so, there's no pinpointed time for recovery that we're planning around. I think what we want to make sure we do is, number one, continue to deliver great value to our clients who do really need us. And so, we don't want to do anything that degrades our ability to do that now. At the same time, we also don't want to make short-term decisions around reducing expenses that impinge upon our ability to actually rebound when there is a recovery. And so, again, what we're talking about now is not specifically when we pivot and when there is a rebound, but really about making sure that we have ample capacity from a selling perspective, from a servicing perspective, from a research analyst perspective, et cetera, so that when there is a rebound, we are poised to take advantage of it. No, I would have said the same exact thing. I would add one point. That business performed very well last year. So, there are tough compares in the back half of the year, but I would echo everything Gene said about the great value that it provides to clients in any sort of economic situation, but particularly in this one. Yeah, there's definitely real value there for clients. But again, tough compares in the second half of the year for that business. You're right. It is tough to guide in this environment. So, thanks for the prelude there. So, we don't guide on contract value. And we're not changing that policy now. I think the way to sort of think about it is we're obviously now comparing our business trends to what was a normal year a year ago, first half of 2019 and second half of 2019.  So, if the economy doesn't recover or we don't see broad-based recoveries around the world, when we get into 2021, we're now comparing to pandemic-impacted results. And so, you would expect, at that point, if we continue at current course and speed with sort of \u2013 this sort of retention result and this sort of new business pacing that the contract value growth would stabilize. I'm not going to peg a number where we think that is, as we've talked about. We do believe that, based on everything we're seeing, the trough is a lot higher than it was during the last downturn for us. But that's as close as you're going to get us sort of pegging a number on it.  But, again, I think the thing that, as we look at the business, and it is tough out there, but our teams are doing a really fantastic job of sort of cutting through the tougher selling environment. And the sheer volume of new business that we're writing is really great. Yes, it's less than we did a year ago, but we're bringing on new logos, we're growing accounts, we're adding new seats, we're adding new subscriptions, doing that across the board. And so, again, I think if we have another 12 months of this, you would see the CV growth stabilize because we'd be comparing to a similarly impacted period when we get 12 months from now. So, Jeff, we're not going to guide for next year. All we're saying is, we would expect when there is an economic recovery for our CV to rebound. And as you know, there's a lag between when that revenue comes, and so we're going to make sure that we scale our business and invest in core things in relation to the contract value, not necessarily the accounting revenue run out. And so, in doing that, that can create some us margin headwinds. That's what we're really saying about 2021. We fully expect to recover, we fully expect to return to growth. But because of the lag in the revenue recognition on the subscription based business, we could see some modest margin headwinds. So, within the Research segment, about 10% of the research revenue, roughly, falls into the non-subscription category. And that is made up of a couple of different revenue lines. One is our online businesses, Capterra, Software Advice and GetApp. And then, there's some other non-subscription type research services that fall into that category as well.  Last quarter, we talked about an expectation that that would be down about 10% to 15% year-over-year. That's sort of what the implied guide reflects as well for the balance of the year for those businesses. And so, about 10% of research revenue and down about 10% to 15% for the balance of the year. Let me cover the numbers and then Gene can talk about the strategy and how we're thinking about headcount growth. So, a couple points, and I'll cover first GTS and then GBS.  So, with GTS, as you mentioned, headcount growth is down about 4% year-over-year. Our intention for the balance of the year is to get that number back up well over 3,100 frontline quota-bearing people. So, we expect to exit the year over 3,100 people, which would put us down a little bit on a year-over-year basis. And part of the reason why it's not up necessarily or I would say optically is down is we actually exited 2019 with a pretty significant bench. So, people on our payroll, who were either in training or had just graduated from training, who weren't yet in territory, and over the first six months of the year, the team did a really good job of making sure we got all those people deployed. And so, our selling capacity is actually in pretty good shape because we've now deployed that bench and have them out there on the frontline selling. And so, we'd expect our year-over-year headcount growth to be down modestly, our year-over-year, as we exit 2020. But from a selling capacity perspective, we feel in pretty good shape. From a GBS perspective, we hit the brakes there hard. We did a lot of work around territory optimization, and we also froze hiring there when we were doing our cost avoidance and cost reduction programs. Our expectation is to get back to about flat for the full year for GBS. And so, while down 9% year-over-year now, we would expect to end 2020 in roughly where we ended 2019, which was \u2013 we ended 2019 with 869. So, think in that neighborhood is our target for where we want to end from GBS headcount perspective.  Gene, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that. So, the marketing is something we obviously \u2013 we knew about and told everyone as we were exiting 2019 to expect it. So, that's sort of the one-time headwind that we knew about and are dealing with. And again, the goal of it is to improve the profitability of that business in a normal environment. And we're well on the way to being able to do that.  I wouldn't call out any one-time benefits. I think that the team has done a really, really good job of, again, fighting through the tougher selling environment, with GBS new business only being down 8% year-over-year, I think was really strong relative performance for that business.  We called out the fact that every major function is contributing to the overall seat growth, with the exception of marketing, which we just talked about. And so, the business is performing pretty well.  And, again, as Gene elaborated, I think with the first question, it's because the value proposition is consistent with what we've done forever from a GTS perspective."

At this time, all participant lines are in listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, David Cohen, GVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDavid Cohen: Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Gartner\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings call, and hope you are well. Joining me today on the call are Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer. The call will include a discussion of first quarter 2020 financial results and our updated outlook for 2020 as disclosed in today\u2019s press release. In addition to today\u2019s release, we have provided a detailed review of our financials and business metrics and an earnings supplement for investors and analysts. We have posted a press release and the earnings supplement on our website, investor.gartner.com. Following comments by Gene and Craig, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] On the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA, with the adjustments as described in our earnings release. Reconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website. We\u2019ve updated the definition we use for free cash flow, the cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP less payments for capital expenditures. Definition of free cash flow no longer excludes acquisition and other non-recurring items as we believe this change better captures actual cash generated in the period for the purposes of capital allocation. In the supplement, we\u2019ve included the historical add-backs for prior periods as well as what they would have been in the first quarter to allow for comparability. Finally, all contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on 2020 foreign exchange rates, unless stated otherwise. Set forth in more detail in today\u2019s earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company\u2019s 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. We encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now I will turn the call over to Gartner\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nGene Hall: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. I hope you\u2019re all safe and healthy. The COVID-19 pandemic is a humanitarian crisis that continues to drive massive social, economic and operational disruption everywhere around the world. As we navigate this environment, there are three messages you should take away from our discussion today. We\u2019re well positioned to help our clients address the pandemic and the economic downturn. We\u2019ve taken steps to carefully manage our costs and cash flow in response to the economic downturn, and we will come out of the recession strong and well positioned to resume driving long term, sustained double-digit growth. As most of you know, Gartner operates in three business segments: Research, Conferences and Consulting. Each of these business segments has been impacted to somewhat differently by the current environment. Research is our largest and most profitable segment and remains the core of our value proposition. Our Research segment is well positioned to operate as a virtual business. Prior to the pandemic, the majority of our analysts, experts and thought leaders were located in countries around the world. They were already supporting our clients via tele and video conferences. A large share of our sales and service teams were placed in centralized office locations, where we\u2019re selling and servicing our clients remotely. All Gartner associates are equipped with laptops configured for a virtual work environment as part of our business continuity program. In response to the pandemic and local government directives, we closed our offices during Q1. Because we had a strong infrastructure in place, associates were able to make a smooth transition to working from home. Of course, not everything went as planned. For example, some associates have relatively slow Internet connections. And some managers had to adjust to managing their teams remotely. Our most immediate challenge has been an increased difficulty bridging prospects and some clients in their remote environments rather in their offices. We continue to make a significant global impact to our research insights, tools and advice. We\u2019re agile with our research content. We continuously adapt our risk agenda to ensure we\u2019re riding on topics that support our clients\u2019 current mission-critical priorities. Q1 was no different. When news of the pandemic broke, we added comprehensive content for every major functional role across the enterprise on critical topics, such as what steps to take in response to COVID 19? What to do so that employees are productive working from home? And how to make smart cost reductions across the organization? In addition, we took the best cross-practice content and made it available to all clients. Findings from our expanded coronavirus coverage and real-time surveys are being widely used by our clients. These insights have also been cited by well-known media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, The Economist and more. During Q1, we significantly increased the number of webinars and other virtual events where we deliver content to our clients. These have been highly valued. For example, in early March, we launched a global webinar on Leading Through COVID-19. Registrations for that event were about 8x more than our average for 2019 webinars. Client engagement is one of the biggest drivers of retention. And by being agile and adapting our content, our client engagement has remained strong. Our services are very cost-effective and provide high-value to clients because we\u2019re able to get the right content to the right audience at the right time in a virtual format. Our new business and renewals have been impacted by COVID-19. In today\u2019s environment, we see three categories of clients. First, there are those companies and industries most impacted by COVID-19, such as travel, entertainment and retail. Renewals and new business with companies in these industries is more difficult than it was last year. However, many realized they continue to need our services and are continuing to buy, just at a slower rate. The second category includes companies that have been minimally impacted economically by COVID-19, such as companies that provide goods or services like food, cleaning supplies and some types of software. Renewals and new business within these companies continues at about the same pace as it has in the past. The third category is companies that are not directly impacted by COVID-19, but are experiencing reduced demand for their products and services. While these companies continue to buy, they\u2019re placing additional scrutiny on all purchases, including Gartner products and services. This can extend the time to complete a sale or renewal. Across GTS and GBS, our clients have expressed how important our services are, especially during these turbulent times. Our HR, finance and legal practices had demand in buying cycles similar to IT. Out of the GBS practices, supply chain and marketing businesses had the weakest performance in Q1. Due to interruptions in supply chains, many supply chain leaders have been forced to pause their strategic initiatives and become more directly involved in tactical supply chain operations. This often extends the time to complete a sale or renewal. As we discussed last quarter, we\u2019re phasing out certain marketing products with low profitability, which reduced the retention and growth rate of our marketing practice. Overall, our Research business is well positioned to operate successfully as a virtual business. Our Conferences segment has been impacted the most by COVID-19. Because of government mandates and health concerns, we were able to hold only a limited number of conferences during Q1. With this situation, we\u2019re now planning to hold 17 destination conferences later this year out of our original full year plan of 77. This, as well as our reduced events schedule, will reduce our expected revenues from our Conferences business. Based on the reduced expected revenues from this segment, we\u2019ve taken steps to reduce costs, including staff reductions. Our conferences provide tremendous value to both attendees and exhibitors. We\u2019re in constant contact with our exhibitors. They continue to have a high level of interest and are ready to return when it\u2019s safe to do so. There\u2019s a similar level of interest among potential attendees. We\u2019re carefully developing changes in our conferences to increase safety, such as sanitization standards, additional separations, et cetera. We\u2019re also developing virtual conference formats. We held our first virtual conference just last week. That conference, for sales leaders, went from a concept to event, including the marketing for the conference in less than three weeks. There were nine sessions held over a single day. We had more than 1,900 total registrations for this conference. The Net Promoter Score was 77, a strong score, which exceeded our expectations. While we are operationally planning to hold conferences during the latter part of the year, we recognize that this may not be possible due to government mandates or health concerns. As a result, our updated financial guidance assumes that we will be unable to hold these conferences. Looking to the long term, we expect Conferences to continue to be an important contributor to our overall business. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research, and provides clients with a deeper level of involvement through extended project-based work to help them execute their most strategic initiatives. Consulting has also been impacted by COVID-19. Many clients are postponing major new initiatives until they have more clarity as to the impact of the pandemic and the economic downturn. As a result, our backlog was up only 1% during Q1. Looking across our business, during Q1, we closed our offices worldwide for the safety of our associates and to comply with government mandates. Consistent with government guidelines, we\u2019ve reopened our offices in Shanghai and Beijing. We\u2019ll use our experiences with these offices to reopen in other countries when shelter-at-home directives begin to relax. We\u2019ve taken steps across the business to manage our costs without impairing our ability to drive growth in the future. We\u2019ve implemented very tight controls in staffing levels, including hiring freezes where appropriate. We reduced staff in our Conferences business, as I mentioned earlier. We significantly cut non-labor spending, and we slowed our capital expenditures such as the build-outs of new office space. The operational changes we made will help ensure we have positive cash flow. In addition, we\u2019re tightly managing our financial operations functions to positively impact cash flows. We\u2019ve also taken steps to help ensure we maintain adequate liquidity. We ended the quarter with $228 million in cash. On April 1, we drew an additional $300 million from our revolver, and we have another $700 million of capacity available. Finally, we\u2019ve negotiated an amendment to our credit facility with financial covenants that gives us improved flexibility. We will come out of the recession strong and well positioned to continue driving long-term sustained double-digit growth. We continue to have vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. We\u2019ll continue to maintain and improve our core capabilities to capture our market opportunity while carefully managing our cost structure and cash flow. We plan to maintain and improve our analyst and adviser capability for developing highly valuable research insights, and strong services capability to meet client needs. We plan to maintain and improve our sales coverage and capacity, while taking this opportunity to address underperforming sales territories. We will remain agile, so we\u2019re prepared for whatever may come next. In summary, as we navigate the uncertainties of this unique environment, these are the three messages you could take away from our discussion today: we are well positioned to help our clients address the pandemic and economic downturn; we\u2019ve taken steps to carefully manage our costs and cash flow in response to the economic downturn; and we will come out of the recession strong and well positioned to resume driving long term, sustained double-digit growth. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our CFO, Craig Safian.\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. I hope you, your families and your colleagues are safe and healthy as we navigate the pandemic and the economic downturn. I\u2019ll provide an update on our strong liquidity and capital structure as well as an overview of the cost actions we have taken to ensure our financial flexibility. Then I will review our first quarter results, including the impact of COVID-19. Finally, I\u2019ll describe our updated outlook for the year within the context of the rapidly evolving macro environment. Beginning in early March, as we first started to see the impacts the pandemic could have on our business, we quickly pivoted to EBITDA preservation and cash conservation mode. Gene described many of the actions we took. The goal of all of the actions was to ensure our financial strength and ongoing flexibility. I\u2019ll start this morning with a discussion of our cash and balance sheet position. At the end of the first quarter, we had $228 million of cash, which is more than we need to run the business. On April 1, to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility, we drew $300 million on our revolver, bringing our cash balance to $528 million. This puts our liquidity in a very strong position, reinforced by our ability to continue to generate positive free cash flow. We have additional revolver capacity of more than $700 million available to us as well. Cash flow trends in April continued on a positive track. Our March 31 debt balance was about $2.2 billion. That increased by $300 million to $2.5 billion after the April 1 revolver draw. We have also amended our credit facility to provide greater covenant flexibility as follows: First, our total leverage covenant has increased 0.5 turn from 4.5 to 5x. Second, our secured leverage covenant has increased by 0.25 turn from 3.5 to 3.75x. Our interest coverage covenant is unchanged. The calculations use gross debt, trailing 12-month EBITDA and trailing 12-month interest expense. Gross debt, EBITDA and interest expense used for the covenant calculations are defined in our 2016 credit agreement. Based on the debt levels after the incremental revolver draw on April 1, our leverage ratios under the covenants were 3.5x total debt, 2.4x secured debt and 7.4x interest coverage. These are all well within the required levels for compliance under our credit facility. While we don\u2019t expect to need the incremental covenant capacity, we secured the amendment to ensure future financial flexibility. We repurchased $73 million of our stock in the first quarter. Of that total, $34 million relate to open market stock repurchases. We paused our share repurchases during the last week of February. We will not resume until we have a clearer picture of how the pandemic and economic downturn will play out. In addition to our strong cash position and access to capital, we are taking steps to align our costs with our revenue, allowing us to continue to generate positive free cash flow. Going into the current situation, we\u2019d already built a plan for 2020 that aligns cost growth with revenue growth. Following the rapid changes in the world as a result of COVID-19, we took additional steps to ensure our long-term financial health and operational excellence through a number of cost-avoidance initiatives. We made tough decisions to eliminate merit increases, freeze hiring temporarily, restrict travel, cancel internal meetings and reduce third-party spending. We have also made reductions to our Conferences staff to better align our cost structure with our Conferences revenue and new schedule. These decisive actions help ensure our ongoing financial flexibility in this challenging and uncertain environment without compromising on the quality of the insight, advice and service we provide to our clients. We remain well positioned to reaccelerate and drive future growth once the timing of the economic recovery in this pandemic becomes more evident. Moving to our first quarter results. Research and Consulting growth were in line with our expectations, and we moved quickly to manage costs late in the quarter. First quarter revenue was $1 billion, up 5% as reported and up 6% on an FX-neutral basis. Excluding Conferences, our revenues were up 11% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. In addition, contribution margin was 66%, up 200 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $214 million, up 51% year-over-year and 53% FX neutral. Our EBITDA performance was tracking strongly through February and then benefited from the cost-avoidance initiatives we implemented in March. Adjusted EPS was $1.20, and free cash flow in the quarter was $31 million. Research revenue in the first quarter grew 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and 11% on an FX-neutral basis. First quarter contribution margin was 72%, as margins benefited from temporary cost-avoidance initiatives, which we will only keep in place while the macro environment remains challenging. Total contract value was $3.5 billion at March 31, FX-neutral growth of 11% versus the prior year. As we do each year, we have updated our historical research metrics at 2020 FX rates in our earnings supplement. Global Technology Sales contract value at the end of the first quarter was $2.8 billion, up 11% versus the prior year. GTS CV growth and associated metrics performed well in January and February, before slowing late in the quarter as the COVID-19 response led to lower new business growth and modestly lower retention rates. The more challenging selling environment had an impact on most of our reported metrics. Client retention for GTS remains at around 82%, down about 50 basis points year-over-year. Wallet retention for GTS was 104% for the quarter, down about 200 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business declined 2% versus last year. We ended the first quarter with 12,826 GTS enterprises, slightly up from last year. The average contract value per enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at $219,000 for enterprise in GTS, up 11% year-over-year. Growth in CV per enterprise reflects the combination of upsell, increased number of subscriptions and price. At the end of the first quarter, we had 3,196 quota-bearing associates in GTS or an increase of 5% year-over-year. As part of our cost reduction programs we announced in late March, we temporarily froze headcount growth. For GTS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning period quota-bearing headcount, was $92,000 per salesperson, down 21% versus the first quarter of last year. As we get more clarity on the economy and the short-term demand environment, we will look to increase sales hiring to position us for sustained long-term double-digit growth on the top and bottom line. Global Business Sales contract value was $646 million at the end of the first quarter. That\u2019s about 20% of our total contract value. CV growth was 8% year-over-year, both reported and organic. GxL CV grew 48% to $307 million, and legacy CV declined 13% year-over-year to $338 million. Total GBS new business was down 12% in the quarter, impacted largely by supply chain and marketing. Our supply chain practice saw a decrease in both retention and new business. The supply chain practice was uniquely affected in the quarter by the global disruptions caused by the pandemic developments in Asia. Last quarter, we explained that we\u2019ve stopped selling and renewing some lower-margin marketing products. As expected, this impacted GBS growth. The GxL legacy split in GBS becomes less meaningful every quarter, so we are phasing out reporting GBS that way. This quarter, we are providing the new business and attrition dollars for GxL and legacy as we did in 2019. In the first quarter, total GxL new business was $22 million, while legacy new business was $5 million. Also in the first quarter, GxL attrition was $17 million and legacy attrition was $14 million. Client retention for GBS was 83%, up about 170 basis points year-over-year. Wallet retention for GBS was 101% for the quarter, up about 700 basis points year-over-year. We ended the first quarter with 5,025 GBS enterprises, down about 4% from last year. The average contract value per enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at $128,000 per enterprise in GBS, up 13% year-over-year. Growth in CV per enterprise reflects upsell, an increased number of subscriptions and price. At the end of the first quarter, we had 862 quota-bearing associates in GBS, down 1% year-over-year. Headcount was down sequentially and year-over-year as we optimized our territories and then temporarily froze hiring as part of our cost-avoidance program. For GBS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning period quota-bearing headcount was $57,000 per salesperson, a significant improvement from when it was negative last year. As we communicated in March, the Conferences segment has been materially impacted by the global response to the pandemic. We were able to hold a few small conferences early in the first quarter, resulting in $14 million of revenue. We will not have any conferences through August. For the rest of the year, we have revised the schedule for in-person conferences. The result is a plan for fewer conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver for our clients. I\u2019ll review some additional points related to Conferences in the guidance section a bit later. First quarter Consulting revenues increased by 3% year-over-year to $96 million. FX-neutral growth was 4%. Consulting contribution margin was 31% in the first quarter, down 14 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Labor-based revenues were $81 million, up 3% versus Q1 of last year or 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 808 was up 9%. Utilization was 62%. Backlog at March 31 was $110 million, up 1% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. Our backlog provides us with about 4.5 months of forward revenue coverage, in line with our operating target. Contract Optimization revenues were up 1% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter against the difficult compare. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. SG&A decreased 4% year-over-year in the first quarter and 3% on an FX-neutral basis as the cost-avoidance initiatives we put in place, specifically around internal meetings and other travel, went into effect. EBITDA for the first quarter was $214 million, up 51% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 53% on an FX-neutral basis. Depreciation in the quarter was up approximately $3 million from last year as additional office space went into service. Amortization was flat sequentially. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $25 million, up from $23 million in the first quarter of 2019. Net interest expense is up due to higher floating to fixed hedge costs as we rolled previous contracts forward. The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 22.5% for the quarter, roughly in line with our guided full year rate. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was also 22.5% in the quarter. We completed an intercompany sale of an intellectual property in April 2020. We expect it will have a material favorable tax impact to our second quarter 2020 financial results. This benefit was already reflected in our full year guidance. Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $1.20. We have updated the definition we use for free cash flow to be: cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, and we will no longer be adding back adjustments or non-recurring items. This free cash flow definition provides a measure that reflects cash available for capital allocation like debt repayment. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $56 million compared to $36 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by cost-avoidance initiatives and improved collections. CapEx for the quarter was $25 million. This includes a small software techquisition that helps increase analyst productivity through automation and AI. Excluding the small acquisition, CapEx would have been down versus the prior year quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $31 million, which is up 101% versus the prior year. This includes outflows of about $10 million of acquisition, integration and other non-recurring items. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 10% on a rolling four-quarter basis, continuing the improvement we\u2019ve been making over the past few years. Free cash flow as a percent of GAAP net income was about 150%, almost back to historical levels. Since there is significantly more uncertainty and volatility in the economy than normal, we are providing an updated outlook for 2020. Before I go through the outlook assumptions for each segment, I\u2019ll start with the overall approach we have taken to developing the updated outlook for 2020. First, we\u2019ve taken our experience and results from March and April to drive forecast for the balance of the year. Second, we have not forecast a recovery for 2020. Third, our overall outlook assumes that we will not be able to run conferences for the balance of the year. We do have plans in place to start delivering conferences again in September if that proves possible. And fourth, we are calibrating our cost reduction programs with our top line results. If business is weaker than forecast, we will further reduce costs to protect EBITDA dollars and cash flow. And if business is stronger than forecast, we will reinstate certain expenses that we had turned off to protect profitability. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we are giving the updated guidance in reported dollar terms, and making no assumptions on future changes or volatility to exchange rates. We now forecast reported Research revenue of at least $3.425 billion for the full year, about 1% to 2% growth. This reflects a continuation of late March and April new business and retention trend through the rest of the year. We expect total CV to decelerate from the first quarter due to a more challenging customer spending and decision-making environment. Based on what we are seeing in March and April and improvements we have made in the business over the past decade, CV growth should remain above the levels we saw in the last downturn. CV changes earlier in the year have a larger impact to full year Research revenue growth. There is a lag effect on Research revenue. So slower CV growth this year may lead to slower Research revenue growth in 2021. As we ramp back up our spending to position ourselves for long-term success, there may be a short-term headwind to margins due to the lag between CV and revenue growth. For the Conferences segment, as I mentioned, we are currently planning to resume conferences in September. However, our guidance is based on not being able to run any conferences for the duration of 2020. The result, without running conferences for the balance of the year, will be revenue of about $35 million. We will continue to incur costs in the Conferences business, both cost of services as well as SG&A. Within the business, we have direct expenses that relate to specific conferences and other expenses that don\u2019t. We won\u2019t be incurring the direct costs related to specific conferences that are canceled. This results in modestly lower cost and lower decremental margins than we had expected when we provided an update in late March. Wherever possible, we expect to roll forward conference participation by exhibitors and attendees to future conferences. If we are able to run our updated conference calendar in the last four months of the year, we estimate additional revenue of approximately $200 million. In addition, at the end of April, we reduced the number of associates in conferences to align with the new reality of the business for 2020. Severance costs of $5 million to $6 million will be incurred in the second quarter. Finally, we have the potential to recover insurance for canceled events beyond the amount of the direct expenses, potentially up to the amount of the lost revenue in some cases. The timing of insurance recovery remains uncertain, but our policies are specific to our Conferences business, and not generic business interruption coverage. The insurance recovery will not be included in EBITDA and is not included in our EBITDA guidance. However, for debt covenant purposes, the insurance recovery is included in the calculation of EBITDA. We continue to work with our insurance brokers and providers and will provide updates on our progress in the future quarters. We now expect reported Consulting revenue of at least $350 million, or a decline of about 11% for the full year. The Consulting outlook contemplates a slowdown in labor-based demand and reflects very challenging compares for the Contract Optimization business through most of the year, and implies being down roughly 15% for the remainder of 2020. Overall, we expect consolidated revenue of at least $3.81 billion. That\u2019s a reported decline of about 10% versus 2019. For the full year, at current FX rates and business mix, we expect a drag on revenue growth of about 130 basis points. Cost-avoidance programs could yield up to $400 million in savings for the full year, assuming no recovery from the economic downturn. The implied operating costs are not a new run rate, but reflect planning assumptions for a cautious view of the revenue outlook. As soon as we can get back to a normal operating environment, we will resume spending to drive future growth. We expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $625 million. That\u2019s despite a revenue impact we currently contemplate of about $800 million, and a roughly $20 million negative impact from FX to EBITDA. If our top line forecast proves conservative, and we are able to restore more normal spending, we continue to expect margins to be at least 16.1%, which will be flat to 2019. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2020. We expect 2020 adjusted EPS of at least $3. For 2020, we expect free cash flow of at least $300 million. Our free cash flow guidance reflects both the P&L outlook we just discussed as well as some slowing of collections. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Finally, for the second quarter of 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA of about $160 million to $165 million. In closing, we are focused on the right things we need to do for our associates, clients and shareholders to deliver long-term value. As Gene discussed, we will execute to come out of the downturn better positioned than before to drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. We know that the value of Gartner is the long-term stream of free cash flows we expect to generate by delivering value to our clients in a very large addressable global market. So while we are taking the steps to ensure our short-term financial flexibility, we remain focused on driving long-term shareholder value. Amid a tough economic backdrop, our Research business had a healthy quarter and Consulting held up as well. We are avoiding expenses, managing cash flow and working through insurance recovery. We maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet, and are focused on maintaining high levels of liquidity and financial flexibility. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator, and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is now open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. Good morning. I wanted to see if you\u2019re willing to provide any of the data around the late March and April new business and retention trends. And as they reset lower starting in mid-March, have you seen them stabilize? And then whether or not you\u2019re able to provide that. Can you tie it to what type of contract value exit rate for 2020 is implied by the updated research revenue guidance?\nCraig Safian: Jeff, thanks for the question. So the way we\u2019re looking at it, obviously, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are tracking really nicely across the entire business, but across our Research business as well through the first two months of the year. And as you also know, a lot of our business tends to come in, in the last two weeks of each month with a heavy emphasis on the last couple of weeks of each quarter. And so we were tracking really well across the businesses. And when we looked at March as a stand-alone, recognizing that there was significant disruption. As Gene mentioned, our clients and us, we all shifted to working in offices to working at home. And so what we saw, when we look at it, was new business declines on a year-over-year basis in the 20% to 25% range. And some hits on our transactional renewal rates as well, I think in the roughly five-point range. And that\u2019s what we experienced in March. In April, trends are kind of on that level. Some are a little bit better, some are consistent, but roughly speaking, on that level. And again, when we developed the guidance for the year, we have not assumed any sort of recovery. And so we\u2019ve basically modeled that new business experience at a granular level across every region and practice in which we do business. And we\u2019ve modeled that straight across assuming no recovery.\nJeff Meuler: And what does that implies for CV exiting the year?\nCraig Safian: So listen Jeff, we don\u2019t provide a contract value guidance. And essentially, there\u2019s a kind of wide range of possible outcomes for that contract value. And so the way we feel about it is definitely going to cause a deceleration in the Research contract value growth rate. That will probably glide down over the year. But what we\u2019ve said is based on everything we can see and the way we\u2019ve modeled it and the improvements we\u2019ve made to the business, we don\u2019t see it drifting down as far as we did in the last downturn.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. And then on the expense savings. I\u2019ll give you kind of my dream buckets, but hopefully, you can just give us some additional perspective. So of like the $400 million, is that in your realized savings? And how does it bucket out between like temporary cost avoidance that comes back when the world goes back to normal? I guess, like taking growth headcount out of it, out of the planning assumptions, which eventually comes back because you\u2019re trying to preserve the ability to grow at double-digit rates long term. And then the third bucket would be, is there any sizable portion that is some form of permanent cost takeout or productivity?\nCraig Safian: Yes. Well, so it\u2019s kind of hard to parse right now. So first, to answer the first part of your question, the up to $400 million is in your 2020 savings. And if you kind of map the changes in our guidance, you\u2019ll need that savings to deliver on the EBITDA guidance or the minimum EBITDA guidance we just gave. As we think about it, the cost avoidance, and to be frank, it is more cost avoidance than cost reduction. As Gene mentioned, and as I mentioned, we\u2019re both very focused on \u2013 we\u2019re all very focused on making sure that when we come out of this, we are strong and prepared to rebound back as quickly as possible, similar to what happened during the last downturn. And so I wouldn\u2019t categorize much of the cost avoidance as \"permanent\". I think that over time, varying degrees of it will get turned back on at different paces. So as an example, as you mentioned with growth headcount, if we are growing a business and we are seeing sales productivity, we\u2019re going to add the right number of research analysts and service people and salespeople. We will absolutely do that to support the business and drive future growth. On top of that, we have large buckets of spend like travel. And that one will probably turn back on at a slower rate than potentially headcount. And then the other thing I\u2019d mention is we\u2019ve made some tough decisions around headcount reductions, as we talked about, and other compensation-related things. And when we get out of this or when we can see our way out of this, we are a people business, and we want to make sure that we keep our team happy and motivated and chasing the goal of consistent double-digit growth.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nGary Bisbee: Good morning. I guess the first question. So it\u2019s interesting to me that the cost cuts, and I\u2019m sure this is sort of an output rather than the goal potentially. But maintain this margin around 16%, and you\u2019re cutting that heavily. But Craig, you acknowledged that there\u2019s potential for the revenue to slow on a lag next year and for the margin to go down as you bring the cost back. Why be so aggressive with cost now? And as part of that really going to delay the ability of the business to rebound? Or was this something you felt you had to do to maintain the liquidity in other \u2013 just solvency of the business?\nGene Hall: Yes, sure. I\u2019ll take the first part \u2013 go ahead, Craig.\nCraig Safian: No. Go ahead, Gene. You can go first.\nGene Hall: Well go ahead. Go ahead, Craig.\nCraig Safian: Okay. So I think you\u2019re right. When we saw what was potentially \u2013 the impacts on the business, most notably our conferences schedule, right? And while Conferences only represents around 11% of revenue, not for nothing, it\u2019s a $500 million business. And as we started to look at the potential for not being able to run a full schedule, only being able to run a partial schedule and potentially, as your outlook reflects not being able to run any conferences at all, we were very focused on really EBITDA preservation, cash conservation, liquidity and financial flexibility, right? Those were kind of our mantras throughout March. And we very aggressively hit the brakes on a lot of items to make sure that we maintain as much financial futility as possible. We\u2019ve done, what I would argue, a really good job of getting that in line, making the tough decisions when we need to. But again, as I mentioned, it\u2019s more cost avoidance than actual cuts. And again, unfortunately, we have had to make some cuts, but the bulk of the savings is really around cost avoidance. And it kind of just did round to that roughly 16% range. We were not solving for that. It was more about just making sure we can maintain as much financial flexibility as possible moving forward. And then I\u2019ll flip it to Gene to talk about the future.\nGene Hall: Yes. I mean, again, Gary, quick on here, we didn\u2019t have a target in terms of margin that we were aiming for. We basically wanted to build in sufficient flexibility for the future that we can cover a range of outcomes. And we\u2019re very much thinking about what\u2019s going to happen in 2020 and 2021, as Craig and I both mentioned in our scripts. And are preparing so that we can return to quite \u2013 we\u2019re hoping to be able to return to quite good growth there, but we\u2019re prepared for whatever may come.\nGary Bisbee: Okay. Just a follow-up then. Within that up to $400 million of cost, and I realize that will be determined by how revenue comes in. But can you help us understand how much of that was really the Conferences business, where you\u2019ve got the major short-term problem versus how much of that is cost avoidance at Research that you\u2019ll have to rebuild to support getting back to double-digit growth over time?\nCraig Safian: Yes. Gary, when we talk about the cost avoidance, we do not cater the costs that we don\u2019t have to have to deliver the conferences. So it\u2019s kind of separate and apart from the Conferences side. What we\u2019ve done on the Conferences side is right size the business, as we kind of \u2013as we talked about. But the bulk of the $400 million relates to, as I mentioned, really more cost-avoidance measures. So we had a plan for 2020. Within that plan, we had pretty decent growth in sales headcount, in service headcount, in other areas of headcount. We\u2019ve temporarily frozen all of that, and that yields a pretty significant amount of savings. We\u2019ve stopped traveling. Obviously, not our choice necessarily, but that yields significant savings. And as I mentioned with Jeff\u2019s question, over time, that will have to be turned back on, but it\u2019s probably not a binary thing where we immediately go back to spending exactly what we were spending pre-crisis. And so it\u2019s kind of a mix of different things, but the bulk of the savings really relate to avoiding costs that we had built into our 2020 plan. And harvesting some savings from things like P&E or maybe not investing as much in facilities or more of things like that, which again, we don\u2019t know what the new reality is going to look like going forward. And as Gene mentioned, everything we\u2019re doing is to maintain as much flexibility financially and operationally as we move forward.\nGary Bisbee: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nCraig Safian: Toni, we\u2019re not hearing you.\nToni Kaplan: Now?\nCraig Safian: Toni? Toni, is that you? Yes, we can hear you now.\nToni Kaplan: Okay. Gene, you spoke about the three impacted client categories. Could you just give us a sense of the proportions for each of those? Just thinking that the COVID-impacted clients could come back quicker, while maybe the impaired business clients could take longer. Just trying to understand how you\u2019re thinking about the pace of recovery in Research.\nGene Hall: So Tony, we don\u2019t have a kind of a quantitative breakdown of those. But I\u2019ll give you kind of a qualitative perspective, which is the largest category is the companies that are not directly impacted by COVID-19. Like for example, some notch hotels, things like \u2013 well that\u2019s not the largest category. The largest categories are the companies that are not directly impacted, but they might sell things to hotels or sell things to airlines. And so they have some impact on their business. That\u2019s the largest category. And then I\u2019d say the second largest category are the companies that are \u2013 in fact, the first of the other two categories are probably equal size, which is the ones that are directly impacted like hotels, restaurants, airlines, things like that. And then equal size would be the companies that are not impacted at all, like if you\u2019re selling video conferencing software or you\u2019re in certain parts of the media business, like streaming media business, for example.\nToni Kaplan: Got it. And I know you mentioned a little bit earlier that you\u2019d expect Research CV growth to sort of glide down during the year. I guess that\u2019s a result of recession as opposed to like sort of a quicker snapback?\nGene Hall: Yes. Craig said in his remarks, we basically, for our guidance, assume no improvement during the year. So we \u2013 if you think about we took the results in March and in April, and said if nothing gets better through the year, what is it going to look like? And so we took our \u2013 think about our new business growth and our retention rates and extra delay to that through the rest of the year with the contracts we have coming up for renewal. And that kind of gives you what happens with business, the Research business.\nToni Kaplan: Got you. And then just for my follow-up. How are you thinking about sort of the timing of conferences, in-person conferences? Are you looking at certain metrics like number of cases and et cetera, to make the determination of holding them? Like do you have to see a vaccine before you feel comfortable before having a lot of in-person conferences again? And just, I guess, going forward, would you expect structurally a higher level of virtual conferences? And if you could give us any sort of sense of revenue differential between like a virtual conference versus an in-person one.\nGene Hall: So in terms of timing, when we restart conferences. First, we have two kind of \u2013 what we call destination conferences where people tend to fly in from around the country. So like Orlando is supposed to be one of those. Then we also have our Evanta conferences, which tend to be small with, I think, 50 people at a local event where people don\u2019t travel. It could be a dinner, it could be a one-day event. And so first, we expect that the conferences that are more local are more likely to be feasible to hold before we\u2019d be able to hold the large destination conferences. The second thing is that as we assess when is a good time to restart, we\u2019re going to get input. Right now, in fact, we have focus groups with both exhibitors and with attendees to get what they think would be necessary for us to restart. And we\u2019re using that information as input. We\u2019re also going to be looking at what the rest of the world is doing. So if the NFL is having \u2013 going to be having football games in the fall and are \u2013 how do people \u2013 are they comfortable doing that? Is Disneyland or Disney World reopening? And so if you look at kind of \u2013 we\u2019re going to look at those kinds of things. And of course, we\u2019re going to look at what the health officials say as well. And so it\u2019s going to be triangulating what clients and potential attendees would say, looking at what the rest of the world is doing and then looking at what the health risks would be. And then triangulate all that stuff to figure out what we actually do. I\u2019m also imagining that it may not be the same answer around the world. So as you probably know, some of the \u2013 some companies open things like these kinds of events in China already. And so we\u2019ll see what happens there and what the health risks are and what the reaction of public is. With regard to \u2013 yes, and so with regard to virtual events, as I mentioned on the call, we\u2019ve already \u2013 we believe that it\u2019s a reasonable bet that our virtual events will be more popular. And so we are experimenting and innovating to look at how do we both hold stand-alone virtual events, but also how do we combine in-person events with virtual events so that if people want to participate, but they are not comfortable in coming virtually and come \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, coming in-person that they can participate virtually. And so we\u2019re developing those models now. We\u2019re testing them. And I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll come up with a good model there.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. My first question was just the Research guidance where the deceleration will be above the levels in the last downturn. I was just hoping, just so we\u2019re on the same page, if you could just give us some color on what those levels were for GTS and GBS?\nCraig Safian: Yes, sure. Thanks, Manav. So during the last downturn, obviously, we were just essentially GTS and just our technology business. It was prior to us acquiring AMR, and it was obviously well in advance of us acquiring CEB. And if you go back and look at the metrics, the CV trough was around negative 4%. So in the second or third quarter of 2009, that was kind of the bottom. And if you look at it, we actually bounced back and rebounded really quickly. And by the midpoint of the next year or end of 2010, we were already back at double-digit growth rates. And so that\u2019s what happened with the CV. When we look at the new business and retention, the new business declines were in the negative 25% range for a couple of quarters when the bad stuff on the Great Recession really started to hit. And our retention rates were down in the, call it, 500 to 750 basis points range as well. As we mentioned, though, there\u2019s probably two primary reasons why we believe we are better positioned today than we were back in 2008, 2009. And we\u2019ve noted them over and over, whenever we\u2019ve gotten questions in the past or as we\u2019ve described our business. But it really is around the types of research we deliver, the real focus we can drive on cost reduction and cost optimization, and the levels of engagement where we drive with our clients consistently and have continued to drive in March and April. And so while we do anticipate or \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t say that, while we have modeled in, based on our March-April experience, that deceleration and glide down, we do feel that we are in a stronger position than we were during the Great Recession in 2008, 2009.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then if I could just follow-up on the EBITDA guidance. The implied second half guidance is much lower than the 2Q number you gave. And I guess I would think 2Q probably ends up being the worst part of it. So I was just curious what the delta is? I mean, I think you\u2019ve maybe thrown out some hints of consoles along the way, but just any bridge there.\nCraig Safian: Yes. I think there\u2019s a couple of things there, Manav. I think number one, we were very fast to harvest cost-avoidance opportunities and anything we could harvest in Q1, we harvested in Q1. And if you think about that from a financial flexibility perspective, we get the benefit of that. If you look at our debt covenants and all that, we get the benefit of that for the next four quarters. And so it\u2019s very important for us to make sure that we harvested as much as we could in Q1 to maintain all that financial flexibility. The second thing I\u2019d say is, if you model out Research revenue, we\u2019ve always said Research revenue growth lags contract value growth because of the revenue recognition. It\u2019s the same thing on the flip side when there is a deceleration in contract value. And so we intend to guide down on \u2013 or we\u2019ve modeled gliding down on the CV growth over the course of the year. The Research revenue glides down at a slower rate, if you will, just because of the revenue recognition methodology that we employ on that large part of the business. And so as we look at Q2 through Q4, again, we\u2019ve tried to be thoughtful around not assuming any sort of recovery. And as Gene mentioned, there are parts of the world, whether it\u2019s conferences or research or what have you, there are parts of the world that are \"reopening up\". But we have not taken that into account. We wanted to be appropriately conservative in thinking about this and not trying to pick when we think a recovery will come, whether it\u2019s a U-shaped recovery or a V-shaped recovery or a W-shaped recovery. We didn\u2019t want to get into guesswork on that. And so I think we\u2019re just trying to make sure that we manage the business appropriately. We take the steps necessary to maintain financial flexibility and we\u2019re also making sure that we maintain capacity in places like sales and research and service so that when we come out of this, we\u2019re prepared to reaccelerate.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up again on the earlier question on Conferences. Hoping you could speak a bit more specifically about kind of how you\u2019re looking at that business in the medium term? Based on some of those focus groups, you referenced, do you expect clients to gradually ramp up to previous attendance levels over the next couple of quarters or years? Or is it your expectation that there will be some sort of permanent reset lower? And then maybe relatedly, is there a way for us to think about the attendance required relative to previous levels in order to make that a worthwhile endeavor?\nGene Hall: So well, see Andrew, we don\u2019t know how fast people are going to come back. And so we\u2019re going to have to play that by year. But I do know, as we\u2019ve done our focus groups that there\u2019s a very effect \u2013 it exceeded our expectations, the level of interest that clients have in attending these types of conferences. And so what we find is that there\u2019s actually quite a bit of enthusiasm, and people are anxious to be able to and looking forward to be able to turn into these. And obviously, if they don\u2019t feel safe, they won\u2019t. But still got to cross that threshold, and we don\u2019t know when that will occur. But the good news is the underlying demand seems to be there. People still want to come to conferences for all the reasons they have in the past. And so to the extent that we can make the environment comfortable, that will draw them faster. And we\u2019re certainly doing that. We\u2019re looking, like I said is, in terms of ways that we can make the conferences \u2013 or we can hold them in a way that people feel very safe going there.\nAndrew Nicholas: Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-up. Sorry if I missed it, but did you outline or mention how much of the expense savings were realized in Q1 specifically?\nCraig Safian: Andrew, we didn\u2019t call that out specifically. But obviously, we had a pretty \u2013 we beat our original guidance pretty significantly in the first quarter. As I mentioned, we were tracking very well from an EBITDA perspective through January and February, and tracking well ahead of our EBITDA budget for those two months. Then on top of that, once we saw some of the challenges that we\u2019re now dealing with, we slammed the brakes on a significant amount of costs. And we are actually able to offset about $46 million worth of lost Conference revenue in the quarter as well. And so as you kind of think about the cost-avoidance benefits in Q1, if you kind of bridge between our original guide and where we ended, that\u2019s a pretty good estimate for how much we were able to save.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Tong: Thanks, good morning. Your GTS sales force productivity declined 21% in 1Q and swung to positive $57,000 in GBS. Can you discuss how productivity trended in April? And what scenarios are contemplated in your updated 2020 guidance?\nCraig Safian: I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019ll start, and then Gene can fill in the blanks. So productivity, as you know, the way we measure it, is a rolling four-quarter measure based on the amount of net contract value growth that we deliver over those rolling four quarters divided by opening headcount. It\u2019s sort of a derivative of all of the other metrics that we look at in terms of what drives contract value growth. And so what we saw in the first quarter, obviously, and you can see this on the specific GTS and GBS pages, is the actual NCVI generated in first quarter of 2020, if I talk about GTS specifically, was less than the NCVI we generated in Q1 of 2019. And so on a rolling four-quarter basis, we lost a, let\u2019s call it, a strong quarter and replaced it with a more challenging quarter. And that\u2019s essentially what impact that productivity measure. Since it is a derivative metric, as \u2013 if contract value growth is going to decline over the balance of the year, productivity will decline as well. And again, if you think about the inputs of productivity at the kind of granular level, they\u2019re the same as we talk about at the highest level, which is what is the retention rate on the contract value that is coming up for renewal and how much new business are you actually able to generate. And as we mentioned, and obviously, in March and through April, because of the environment, both of those metrics had pressure on them. And so we would expect that pressure \u2013 or I should say we\u2019ve modeled that pressure, consistent pressure, to continue through the balance of the year. With GBS, obviously, last year, we had a bunch of negative quarters in the rolling four-quarter measure. And so now we\u2019ve obviously flipped to positive in GBS, which is great and where we want to be. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that flip to \u2013 from negative to positive in the first quarter. But the same dynamics that apply to new business and retention for GTS will also apply to GBS, or at least as we\u2019ve modeled them through the balance of the year.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. So you talked about planning $400 million in cost savings this year. Does this assume that the Research sales force headcount freeze will extend through the end of the year? And given it takes a year for new sales force hires to ramp in productivity, what are your thoughts on whether the glide down in Research CV will extend into 2021?\nCraig Safian: So I think a lot of the dynamics related to research contract value growth in the kind of short to mid-term will be driven by recovery. And so if there is a recovery in the third quarter or the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year, obviously, that is what\u2019s going to support contract value kind of bouncing back and reaccelerating in the short to midterm. Gene, I don\u2019t know if you want to take the question on GTS headcount specifically and how we\u2019re thinking about it.\nGene Hall: Yes. So George, basically, we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re going to set GTS headcount based on the productivity we\u2019re seeing at an individual territory basis. And so where we see territory, if we \u2013 today, we see territories that are \u2013 have good productivity, we\u2019re going to be adding to those territories. And so it\u2019s going to be just looking sort of at what\u2019s our overall productivity territory by territory? And are there places that we could productively add territories, we\u2019ll do that. And so you shouldn\u2019t think about that our sales headcount in GTS is frozen for the year. We\u2019re going to moderate that headcount based on the productivity we see.\nGeorge Tong: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jeffries. Your line is now open.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. I had a question around how discretionary is the GBS portfolio in terms of customer spend versus GTS? So when you think about marketing, legal, HR, supply chain, is that much more discretionary versus your core IT business? Or asked another way, the net new business that you\u2019re seeing down 20% to 25%, is that larger in the marketing segment or HR? Any thoughts there because you didn\u2019t own GBS in the prior downturn.\nCraig Safian: Yes. So I wouldn\u2019t think about GBS as being more discretionary than GTS. And here\u2019s how we think about it, which is that in GBS, so first, things like HR, finance, legal, as I mentioned in my remarks, really have characteristics in terms of buying cycles, buying criteria, things like that as in GTS. And I mentioned also that in marketing and in supply chain, there are specific issues. And in supply chain, the issue is that a lot of the supply chain leaders that we would sell to are actually doing tactical operational things in their business because supply chains are struggling in their companies. Because of marketing, it\u2019s impacted by the fact that we had these product lines we talked about that we are discontinuing because the profitability wasn\u2019t where we wanted it to be. And so those two things are actually taking the GBS growth lower than it would otherwise be. And then the other factor that affects GBS that\u2019s different than GTS is our GTS sales and service teams have much more experience. We have sales and service people in GTS that have been working there for 10, 15, 20 years. In GBS, we have a much smaller group of people that have been using those same playbooks for that kind of period of time. And so we expect that, that will have an impact. But over time, they\u2019ll keep getting better and better and approach GTS levels. And so those are kind of the two factors that affect why GBS has been a little bit of a laggard relative to GTS.\nHamzah Mazari: That\u2019s very helpful. Just a follow-up question. Anything you\u2019re seeing geography-wise in April that\u2019s different? Maybe any learnings from areas that have come out of the shutdown, if you have any, and what you\u2019re seeing there?\nGene Hall: So we\u2019re in 100 countries around the world. They vary a lot. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I would take away specifically strongly, like I\u2019ll give you two examples. India and Japan have been doing well for us relative to other countries. But I think it\u2019s just our execution was just a little bit better there is kind of what I\u2019d put it up to as opposed to us \u2013 as opposed to it. There\u2019s something fundamentally different there about the economy or something like that.\nHamzah Mazari: Got you. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Gene Hall for closing remarks.\nGene Hall: So as you heard from our call today, as we navigate the uncertainties of our current environment, we are well positioned to help our clients address both the pandemic and the economic downturn. We\u2019ve taken steps to carefully manage our costs and cash flow in response to the economic downturn. And we\u2019re going to come out of the recession strong and well positioned to resume driving long-term sustained double-digit growth. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. I hope you, your families and your colleagues are safe and healthy as we navigate the pandemic and the economic downturn. I'll provide an update on our strong liquidity and capital structure as well as an overview of the cost actions we have taken to ensure our financial flexibility. Then I will review our first quarter results, including the impact of COVID-19. Finally, I'll describe our updated outlook for the year within the context of the rapidly evolving macro environment. Beginning in early March, as we first started to see the impacts the pandemic could have on our business, we quickly pivoted to EBITDA preservation and cash conservation mode. Gene described many of the actions we took. The goal of all of the actions was to ensure our financial strength and ongoing flexibility. I'll start this morning with a discussion of our cash and balance sheet position. At the end of the first quarter, we had $228 million of cash, which is more than we need to run the business. On April 1, to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility, we drew $300 million on our revolver, bringing our cash balance to $528 million. This puts our liquidity in a very strong position, reinforced by our ability to continue to generate positive free cash flow. We have additional revolver capacity of more than $700 million available to us as well. Cash flow trends in April continued on a positive track. Our March 31 debt balance was about $2.2 billion. That increased by $300 million to $2.5 billion after the April 1 revolver draw. We have also amended our credit facility to provide greater covenant flexibility as follows: First, our total leverage covenant has increased 0.5 turn from 4.5 to 5x. Second, our secured leverage covenant has increased by 0.25 turn from 3.5 to 3.75x. Our interest coverage covenant is unchanged. The calculations use gross debt, trailing 12-month EBITDA and trailing 12-month interest expense. Gross debt, EBITDA and interest expense used for the covenant calculations are defined in our 2016 credit agreement. Based on the debt levels after the incremental revolver draw on April 1, our leverage ratios under the covenants were 3.5x total debt, 2.4x secured debt and 7.4x interest coverage. These are all well within the required levels for compliance under our credit facility. While we don't expect to need the incremental covenant capacity, we secured the amendment to ensure future financial flexibility. We repurchased $73 million of our stock in the first quarter. Of that total, $34 million relate to open market stock repurchases. We paused our share repurchases during the last week of February. We will not resume until we have a clearer picture of how the pandemic and economic downturn will play out. In addition to our strong cash position and access to capital, we are taking steps to align our costs with our revenue, allowing us to continue to generate positive free cash flow. Going into the current situation, we'd already built a plan for 2020 that aligns cost growth with revenue growth. Following the rapid changes in the world as a result of COVID-19, we took additional steps to ensure our long-term financial health and operational excellence through a number of cost-avoidance initiatives. We made tough decisions to eliminate merit increases, freeze hiring temporarily, restrict travel, cancel internal meetings and reduce third-party spending. We have also made reductions to our Conferences staff to better align our cost structure with our Conferences revenue and new schedule. These decisive actions help ensure our ongoing financial flexibility in this challenging and uncertain environment without compromising on the quality of the insight, advice and service we provide to our clients. We remain well positioned to reaccelerate and drive future growth once the timing of the economic recovery in this pandemic becomes more evident. Moving to our first quarter results. Research and Consulting growth were in line with our expectations, and we moved quickly to manage costs late in the quarter. First quarter revenue was $1 billion, up 5% as reported and up 6% on an FX-neutral basis. Excluding Conferences, our revenues were up 11% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. In addition, contribution margin was 66%, up 200 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $214 million, up 51% year-over-year and 53% FX neutral. Our EBITDA performance was tracking strongly through February and then benefited from the cost-avoidance initiatives we implemented in March. Adjusted EPS was $1.20, and free cash flow in the quarter was $31 million. Research revenue in the first quarter grew 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and 11% on an FX-neutral basis. First quarter contribution margin was 72%, as margins benefited from temporary cost-avoidance initiatives, which we will only keep in place while the macro environment remains challenging. Total contract value was $3.5 billion at March 31, FX-neutral growth of 11% versus the prior year. As we do each year, we have updated our historical research metrics at 2020 FX rates in our earnings supplement. Global Technology Sales contract value at the end of the first quarter was $2.8 billion, up 11% versus the prior year. GTS CV growth and associated metrics performed well in January and February, before slowing late in the quarter as the COVID-19 response led to lower new business growth and modestly lower retention rates. The more challenging selling environment had an impact on most of our reported metrics. Client retention for GTS remains at around 82%, down about 50 basis points year-over-year. Wallet retention for GTS was 104% for the quarter, down about 200 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business declined 2% versus last year. We ended the first quarter with 12,826 GTS enterprises, slightly up from last year. The average contract value per enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at $219,000 for enterprise in GTS, up 11% year-over-year. Growth in CV per enterprise reflects the combination of upsell, increased number of subscriptions and price. At the end of the first quarter, we had 3,196 quota-bearing associates in GTS or an increase of 5% year-over-year. As part of our cost reduction programs we announced in late March, we temporarily froze headcount growth. For GTS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning period quota-bearing headcount, was $92,000 per salesperson, down 21% versus the first quarter of last year. As we get more clarity on the economy and the short-term demand environment, we will look to increase sales hiring to position us for sustained long-term double-digit growth on the top and bottom line. Global Business Sales contract value was $646 million at the end of the first quarter. That's about 20% of our total contract value. CV growth was 8% year-over-year, both reported and organic. GxL CV grew 48% to $307 million, and legacy CV declined 13% year-over-year to $338 million. Total GBS new business was down 12% in the quarter, impacted largely by supply chain and marketing. Our supply chain practice saw a decrease in both retention and new business. The supply chain practice was uniquely affected in the quarter by the global disruptions caused by the pandemic developments in Asia. Last quarter, we explained that we've stopped selling and renewing some lower-margin marketing products. As expected, this impacted GBS growth. The GxL legacy split in GBS becomes less meaningful every quarter, so we are phasing out reporting GBS that way. This quarter, we are providing the new business and attrition dollars for GxL and legacy as we did in 2019. In the first quarter, total GxL new business was $22 million, while legacy new business was $5 million. Also in the first quarter, GxL attrition was $17 million and legacy attrition was $14 million. Client retention for GBS was 83%, up about 170 basis points year-over-year. Wallet retention for GBS was 101% for the quarter, up about 700 basis points year-over-year. We ended the first quarter with 5,025 GBS enterprises, down about 4% from last year. The average contract value per enterprise continues to grow. It now stands at $128,000 per enterprise in GBS, up 13% year-over-year. Growth in CV per enterprise reflects upsell, an increased number of subscriptions and price. At the end of the first quarter, we had 862 quota-bearing associates in GBS, down 1% year-over-year. Headcount was down sequentially and year-over-year as we optimized our territories and then temporarily froze hiring as part of our cost-avoidance program. For GBS, the year-over-year net contract value increase, or NCVI, divided by the beginning period quota-bearing headcount was $57,000 per salesperson, a significant improvement from when it was negative last year. As we communicated in March, the Conferences segment has been materially impacted by the global response to the pandemic. We were able to hold a few small conferences early in the first quarter, resulting in $14 million of revenue. We will not have any conferences through August. For the rest of the year, we have revised the schedule for in-person conferences. The result is a plan for fewer conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver for our clients. I'll review some additional points related to Conferences in the guidance section a bit later. First quarter Consulting revenues increased by 3% year-over-year to $96 million. FX-neutral growth was 4%. Consulting contribution margin was 31% in the first quarter, down 14 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Labor-based revenues were $81 million, up 3% versus Q1 of last year or 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 808 was up 9%. Utilization was 62%. Backlog at March 31 was $110 million, up 1% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. Our backlog provides us with about 4.5 months of forward revenue coverage, in line with our operating target. Contract Optimization revenues were up 1% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter against the difficult compare. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. SG&A decreased 4% year-over-year in the first quarter and 3% on an FX-neutral basis as the cost-avoidance initiatives we put in place, specifically around internal meetings and other travel, went into effect. EBITDA for the first quarter was $214 million, up 51% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 53% on an FX-neutral basis. Depreciation in the quarter was up approximately $3 million from last year as additional office space went into service. Amortization was flat sequentially. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $25 million, up from $23 million in the first quarter of 2019. Net interest expense is up due to higher floating to fixed hedge costs as we rolled previous contracts forward. The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 22.5% for the quarter, roughly in line with our guided full year rate. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was also 22.5% in the quarter. We completed an intercompany sale of an intellectual property in April 2020. We expect it will have a material favorable tax impact to our second quarter 2020 financial results. This benefit was already reflected in our full year guidance. Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $1.20. We have updated the definition we use for free cash flow to be: cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, and we will no longer be adding back adjustments or non-recurring items. This free cash flow definition provides a measure that reflects cash available for capital allocation like debt repayment. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $56 million compared to $36 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by cost-avoidance initiatives and improved collections. CapEx for the quarter was $25 million. This includes a small software techquisition that helps increase analyst productivity through automation and AI. Excluding the small acquisition, CapEx would have been down versus the prior year quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $31 million, which is up 101% versus the prior year. This includes outflows of about $10 million of acquisition, integration and other non-recurring items. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 10% on a rolling four-quarter basis, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow as a percent of GAAP net income was about 150%, almost back to historical levels. Since there is significantly more uncertainty and volatility in the economy than normal, we are providing an updated outlook for 2020. Before I go through the outlook assumptions for each segment, I'll start with the overall approach we have taken to developing the updated outlook for 2020. First, we've taken our experience and results from March and April to drive forecast for the balance of the year. Second, we have not forecast a recovery for 2020. Third, our overall outlook assumes that we will not be able to run conferences for the balance of the year. We do have plans in place to start delivering conferences again in September if that proves possible. And fourth, we are calibrating our cost reduction programs with our top line results. If business is weaker than forecast, we will further reduce costs to protect EBITDA dollars and cash flow. And if business is stronger than forecast, we will reinstate certain expenses that we had turned off to protect profitability. With the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we are giving the updated guidance in reported dollar terms, and making no assumptions on future changes or volatility to exchange rates. We now forecast reported Research revenue of at least $3.425 billion for the full year, about 1% to 2% growth. This reflects a continuation of late March and April new business and retention trend through the rest of the year. We expect total CV to decelerate from the first quarter due to a more challenging customer spending and decision-making environment. Based on what we are seeing in March and April and improvements we have made in the business over the past decade, CV growth should remain above the levels we saw in the last downturn. CV changes earlier in the year have a larger impact to full year Research revenue growth. There is a lag effect on Research revenue. So slower CV growth this year may lead to slower Research revenue growth in 2021. As we ramp back up our spending to position ourselves for long-term success, there may be a short-term headwind to margins due to the lag between CV and revenue growth. For the Conferences segment, as I mentioned, we are currently planning to resume conferences in September. However, our guidance is based on not being able to run any conferences for the duration of 2020. The result, without running conferences for the balance of the year, will be revenue of about $35 million. We will continue to incur costs in the Conferences business, both cost of services as well as SG&A. Within the business, we have direct expenses that relate to specific conferences and other expenses that don't. We won't be incurring the direct costs related to specific conferences that are canceled. This results in modestly lower cost and lower decremental margins than we had expected when we provided an update in late March. Wherever possible, we expect to roll forward conference participation by exhibitors and attendees to future conferences. If we are able to run our updated conference calendar in the last four months of the year, we estimate additional revenue of approximately $200 million. In addition, at the end of April, we reduced the number of associates in conferences to align with the new reality of the business for 2020. Severance costs of $5 million to $6 million will be incurred in the second quarter. Finally, we have the potential to recover insurance for canceled events beyond the amount of the direct expenses, potentially up to the amount of the lost revenue in some cases. The timing of insurance recovery remains uncertain, but our policies are specific to our Conferences business, and not generic business interruption coverage. The insurance recovery will not be included in EBITDA and is not included in our EBITDA guidance. However, for debt covenant purposes, the insurance recovery is included in the calculation of EBITDA. We continue to work with our insurance brokers and providers and will provide updates on our progress in the future quarters. We now expect reported Consulting revenue of at least $350 million, or a decline of about 11% for the full year. The Consulting outlook contemplates a slowdown in labor-based demand and reflects very challenging compares for the Contract Optimization business through most of the year, and implies being down roughly 15% for the remainder of 2020. Overall, we expect consolidated revenue of at least $3.81 billion. That's a reported decline of about 10% versus 2019. For the full year, at current FX rates and business mix, we expect a drag on revenue growth of about 130 basis points. Cost-avoidance programs could yield up to $400 million in savings for the full year, assuming no recovery from the economic downturn. The implied operating costs are not a new run rate, but reflect planning assumptions for a cautious view of the revenue outlook. As soon as we can get back to a normal operating environment, we will resume spending to drive future growth. We expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $625 million. That's despite a revenue impact we currently contemplate of about $800 million, and a roughly $20 million negative impact from FX to EBITDA. If our top line forecast proves conservative, and we are able to restore more normal spending, we continue to expect margins to be at least 16.1%, which will be flat to 2019. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2020. We expect 2020 adjusted EPS of at least $3. For 2020, we expect free cash flow of at least $300 million. Our free cash flow guidance reflects both the P&L outlook we just discussed as well as some slowing of collections. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Finally, for the second quarter of 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA of about $160 million to $165 million. In closing, we are focused on the right things we need to do for our associates, clients and shareholders to deliver long-term value. As Gene discussed, we will execute to come out of the downturn better positioned than before to drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. We know that the value of Gartner is the long-term stream of free cash flows we expect to generate by delivering value to our clients in a very large addressable global market. So while we are taking the steps to ensure our short-term financial flexibility, we remain focused on driving long-term shareholder value. Amid a tough economic backdrop, our Research business had a healthy quarter and Consulting held up as well. We are avoiding expenses, managing cash flow and working through insurance recovery. We maintain a strong and healthy balance sheet, and are focused on maintaining high levels of liquidity and financial flexibility. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Jeff, thanks for the question. So the way we're looking at it, obviously, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are tracking really nicely across the entire business, but across our Research business as well through the first two months of the year. And as you also know, a lot of our business tends to come in, in the last two weeks of each month with a heavy emphasis on the last couple of weeks of each quarter. And so we were tracking really well across the businesses. And when we looked at March as a stand-alone, recognizing that there was significant disruption. As Gene mentioned, our clients and us, we all shifted to working in offices to working at home. And so what we saw, when we look at it, was new business declines on a year-over-year basis in the 20% to 25% range. And some hits on our transactional renewal rates as well, I think in the roughly five-point range. And that's what we experienced in March. In April, trends are kind of on that level. Some are a little bit better, some are consistent, but roughly speaking, on that level. And again, when we developed the guidance for the year, we have not assumed any sort of recovery. And so we've basically modeled that new business experience at a granular level across every region and practice in which we do business. And we've modeled that straight across assuming no recovery. So listen Jeff, we don't provide a contract value guidance. And essentially, there's a kind of wide range of possible outcomes for that contract value. And so the way we feel about it is definitely going to cause a deceleration in the Research contract value growth rate. That will probably glide down over the year. But what we've said is based on everything we can see and the way we've modeled it and the improvements we've made to the business, we don't see it drifting down as far as we did in the last downturn. Yes. Well, so it's kind of hard to parse right now. So first, to answer the first part of your question, the up to $400 million is in your 2020 savings. And if you kind of map the changes in our guidance, you'll need that savings to deliver on the EBITDA guidance or the minimum EBITDA guidance we just gave. As we think about it, the cost avoidance, and to be frank, it is more cost avoidance than cost reduction. As Gene mentioned, and as I mentioned, we're both very focused on \u2013 we're all very focused on making sure that when we come out of this, we are strong and prepared to rebound back as quickly as possible, similar to what happened during the last downturn. And so I wouldn't categorize much of the cost avoidance as \"permanent\". I think that over time, varying degrees of it will get turned back on at different paces. So as an example, as you mentioned with growth headcount, if we are growing a business and we are seeing sales productivity, we're going to add the right number of research analysts and service people and salespeople. We will absolutely do that to support the business and drive future growth. On top of that, we have large buckets of spend like travel. And that one will probably turn back on at a slower rate than potentially headcount. And then the other thing I'd mention is we've made some tough decisions around headcount reductions, as we talked about, and other compensation-related things. And when we get out of this or when we can see our way out of this, we are a people business, and we want to make sure that we keep our team happy and motivated and chasing the goal of consistent double-digit growth. No. Go ahead, Gene. You can go first. Okay. So I think you're right. When we saw what was potentially \u2013 the impacts on the business, most notably our conferences schedule, right? And while Conferences only represents around 11% of revenue, not for nothing, it's a $500 million business. And as we started to look at the potential for not being able to run a full schedule, only being able to run a partial schedule and potentially, as your outlook reflects not being able to run any conferences at all, we were very focused on really EBITDA preservation, cash conservation, liquidity and financial flexibility, right? Those were kind of our mantras throughout March. And we very aggressively hit the brakes on a lot of items to make sure that we maintain as much financial futility as possible. We've done, what I would argue, a really good job of getting that in line, making the tough decisions when we need to. But again, as I mentioned, it's more cost avoidance than actual cuts. And again, unfortunately, we have had to make some cuts, but the bulk of the savings is really around cost avoidance. And it kind of just did round to that roughly 16% range. We were not solving for that. It was more about just making sure we can maintain as much financial flexibility as possible moving forward. And then I'll flip it to Gene to talk about the future. Yes. Gary, when we talk about the cost avoidance, we do not cater the costs that we don't have to have to deliver the conferences. So it's kind of separate and apart from the Conferences side. What we've done on the Conferences side is right size the business, as we kind of \u2013as we talked about. But the bulk of the $400 million relates to, as I mentioned, really more cost-avoidance measures. So we had a plan for 2020. Within that plan, we had pretty decent growth in sales headcount, in service headcount, in other areas of headcount. We've temporarily frozen all of that, and that yields a pretty significant amount of savings. We've stopped traveling. Obviously, not our choice necessarily, but that yields significant savings. And as I mentioned with Jeff's question, over time, that will have to be turned back on, but it's probably not a binary thing where we immediately go back to spending exactly what we were spending pre-crisis. And so it's kind of a mix of different things, but the bulk of the savings really relate to avoiding costs that we had built into our 2020 plan. And harvesting some savings from things like P&E or maybe not investing as much in facilities or more of things like that, which again, we don't know what the new reality is going to look like going forward. And as Gene mentioned, everything we're doing is to maintain as much flexibility financially and operationally as we move forward. Toni, we're not hearing you. Toni? Toni, is that you? Yes, we can hear you now. Yes, sure. Thanks, Manav. So during the last downturn, obviously, we were just essentially GTS and just our technology business. It was prior to us acquiring AMR, and it was obviously well in advance of us acquiring CEB. And if you go back and look at the metrics, the CV trough was around negative 4%. So in the second or third quarter of 2009, that was kind of the bottom. And if you look at it, we actually bounced back and rebounded really quickly. And by the midpoint of the next year or end of 2010, we were already back at double-digit growth rates. And so that's what happened with the CV. When we look at the new business and retention, the new business declines were in the negative 25% range for a couple of quarters when the bad stuff on the Great Recession really started to hit. And our retention rates were down in the, call it, 500 to 750 basis points range as well. As we mentioned, though, there's probably two primary reasons why we believe we are better positioned today than we were back in 2008, 2009. And we've noted them over and over, whenever we've gotten questions in the past or as we've described our business. But it really is around the types of research we deliver, the real focus we can drive on cost reduction and cost optimization, and the levels of engagement where we drive with our clients consistently and have continued to drive in March and April. And so while we do anticipate or \u2013 I shouldn't say that, while we have modeled in, based on our March-April experience, that deceleration and glide down, we do feel that we are in a stronger position than we were during the Great Recession in 2008, 2009. Yes. I think there's a couple of things there, Manav. I think number one, we were very fast to harvest cost-avoidance opportunities and anything we could harvest in Q1, we harvested in Q1. And if you think about that from a financial flexibility perspective, we get the benefit of that. If you look at our debt covenants and all that, we get the benefit of that for the next four quarters. And so it's very important for us to make sure that we harvested as much as we could in Q1 to maintain all that financial flexibility. The second thing I'd say is, if you model out Research revenue, we've always said Research revenue growth lags contract value growth because of the revenue recognition. It's the same thing on the flip side when there is a deceleration in contract value. And so we intend to guide down on \u2013 or we've modeled gliding down on the CV growth over the course of the year. The Research revenue glides down at a slower rate, if you will, just because of the revenue recognition methodology that we employ on that large part of the business. And so as we look at Q2 through Q4, again, we've tried to be thoughtful around not assuming any sort of recovery. And as Gene mentioned, there are parts of the world, whether it's conferences or research or what have you, there are parts of the world that are \"reopening up\". But we have not taken that into account. We wanted to be appropriately conservative in thinking about this and not trying to pick when we think a recovery will come, whether it's a U-shaped recovery or a V-shaped recovery or a W-shaped recovery. We didn't want to get into guesswork on that. And so I think we're just trying to make sure that we manage the business appropriately. We take the steps necessary to maintain financial flexibility and we're also making sure that we maintain capacity in places like sales and research and service so that when we come out of this, we're prepared to reaccelerate. Andrew, we didn't call that out specifically. But obviously, we had a pretty \u2013 we beat our original guidance pretty significantly in the first quarter. As I mentioned, we were tracking very well from an EBITDA perspective through January and February, and tracking well ahead of our EBITDA budget for those two months. Then on top of that, once we saw some of the challenges that we're now dealing with, we slammed the brakes on a significant amount of costs. And we are actually able to offset about $46 million worth of lost Conference revenue in the quarter as well. And so as you kind of think about the cost-avoidance benefits in Q1, if you kind of bridge between our original guide and where we ended, that's a pretty good estimate for how much we were able to save. I'll take it. I'll start, and then Gene can fill in the blanks. So productivity, as you know, the way we measure it, is a rolling four-quarter measure based on the amount of net contract value growth that we deliver over those rolling four quarters divided by opening headcount. It's sort of a derivative of all of the other metrics that we look at in terms of what drives contract value growth. And so what we saw in the first quarter, obviously, and you can see this on the specific GTS and GBS pages, is the actual NCVI generated in first quarter of 2020, if I talk about GTS specifically, was less than the NCVI we generated in Q1 of 2019. And so on a rolling four-quarter basis, we lost a, let's call it, a strong quarter and replaced it with a more challenging quarter. And that's essentially what impact that productivity measure. Since it is a derivative metric, as \u2013 if contract value growth is going to decline over the balance of the year, productivity will decline as well. And again, if you think about the inputs of productivity at the kind of granular level, they're the same as we talk about at the highest level, which is what is the retention rate on the contract value that is coming up for renewal and how much new business are you actually able to generate. And as we mentioned, and obviously, in March and through April, because of the environment, both of those metrics had pressure on them. And so we would expect that pressure \u2013 or I should say we've modeled that pressure, consistent pressure, to continue through the balance of the year. With GBS, obviously, last year, we had a bunch of negative quarters in the rolling four-quarter measure. And so now we've obviously flipped to positive in GBS, which is great and where we want to be. And that's what's driving that flip to \u2013 from negative to positive in the first quarter. But the same dynamics that apply to new business and retention for GTS will also apply to GBS, or at least as we've modeled them through the balance of the year. So I think a lot of the dynamics related to research contract value growth in the kind of short to mid-term will be driven by recovery. And so if there is a recovery in the third quarter or the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year, obviously, that is what's going to support contract value kind of bouncing back and reaccelerating in the short to midterm. Gene, I don't know if you want to take the question on GTS headcount specifically and how we're thinking about it. Yes. So I wouldn't think about GBS as being more discretionary than GTS. And here's how we think about it, which is that in GBS, so first, things like HR, finance, legal, as I mentioned in my remarks, really have characteristics in terms of buying cycles, buying criteria, things like that as in GTS. And I mentioned also that in marketing and in supply chain, there are specific issues. And in supply chain, the issue is that a lot of the supply chain leaders that we would sell to are actually doing tactical operational things in their business because supply chains are struggling in their companies. Because of marketing, it's impacted by the fact that we had these product lines we talked about that we are discontinuing because the profitability wasn't where we wanted it to be. And so those two things are actually taking the GBS growth lower than it would otherwise be. And then the other factor that affects GBS that's different than GTS is our GTS sales and service teams have much more experience. We have sales and service people in GTS that have been working there for 10, 15, 20 years. In GBS, we have a much smaller group of people that have been using those same playbooks for that kind of period of time. And so we expect that, that will have an impact. But over time, they'll keep getting better and better and approach GTS levels. And so those are kind of the two factors that affect why GBS has been a little bit of a laggard relative to GTS."

            "name": "Gene Hall",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us. I hope you're all safe and healthy. The COVID-19 pandemic is a humanitarian crisis that continues to drive massive social, economic and operational disruption everywhere around the world. As we navigate this environment, there are three messages you should take away from our discussion today. We're well positioned to help our clients address the pandemic and the economic downturn. We've taken steps to carefully manage our costs and cash flow in response to the economic downturn, and we will come out of the recession strong and well positioned to resume driving long term, sustained double-digit growth. As most of you know, Gartner operates in three business segments: Research, Conferences and Consulting. Each of these business segments has been impacted to somewhat differently by the current environment. Research is our largest and most profitable segment and remains the core of our value proposition. Our Research segment is well positioned to operate as a virtual business. Prior to the pandemic, the majority of our analysts, experts and thought leaders were located in countries around the world. They were already supporting our clients via tele and video conferences. A large share of our sales and service teams were placed in centralized office locations, where we're selling and servicing our clients remotely. All Gartner associates are equipped with laptops configured for a virtual work environment as part of our business continuity program. In response to the pandemic and local government directives, we closed our offices during Q1. Because we had a strong infrastructure in place, associates were able to make a smooth transition to working from home. Of course, not everything went as planned. For example, some associates have relatively slow Internet connections. And some managers had to adjust to managing their teams remotely. Our most immediate challenge has been an increased difficulty bridging prospects and some clients in their remote environments rather in their offices. We continue to make a significant global impact to our research insights, tools and advice. We're agile with our research content. We continuously adapt our risk agenda to ensure we're riding on topics that support our clients' current mission-critical priorities. Q1 was no different. When news of the pandemic broke, we added comprehensive content for every major functional role across the enterprise on critical topics, such as what steps to take in response to COVID 19? What to do so that employees are productive working from home? And how to make smart cost reductions across the organization? In addition, we took the best cross-practice content and made it available to all clients. Findings from our expanded coronavirus coverage and real-time surveys are being widely used by our clients. These insights have also been cited by well-known media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, The Economist and more. During Q1, we significantly increased the number of webinars and other virtual events where we deliver content to our clients. These have been highly valued. For example, in early March, we launched a global webinar on Leading Through COVID-19. Registrations for that event were about 8x more than our average for 2019 webinars. Client engagement is one of the biggest drivers of retention. And by being agile and adapting our content, our client engagement has remained strong. Our services are very cost-effective and provide high-value to clients because we're able to get the right content to the right audience at the right time in a virtual format. Our new business and renewals have been impacted by COVID-19. In today's environment, we see three categories of clients. First, there are those companies and industries most impacted by COVID-19, such as travel, entertainment and retail. Renewals and new business with companies in these industries is more difficult than it was last year. However, many realized they continue to need our services and are continuing to buy, just at a slower rate. The second category includes companies that have been minimally impacted economically by COVID-19, such as companies that provide goods or services like food, cleaning supplies and some types of software. Renewals and new business within these companies continues at about the same pace as it has in the past. The third category is companies that are not directly impacted by COVID-19, but are experiencing reduced demand for their products and services. While these companies continue to buy, they're placing additional scrutiny on all purchases, including Gartner products and services. This can extend the time to complete a sale or renewal. Across GTS and GBS, our clients have expressed how important our services are, especially during these turbulent times. Our HR, finance and legal practices had demand in buying cycles similar to IT. Out of the GBS practices, supply chain and marketing businesses had the weakest performance in Q1. Due to interruptions in supply chains, many supply chain leaders have been forced to pause their strategic initiatives and become more directly involved in tactical supply chain operations. This often extends the time to complete a sale or renewal. As we discussed last quarter, we're phasing out certain marketing products with low profitability, which reduced the retention and growth rate of our marketing practice. Overall, our Research business is well positioned to operate successfully as a virtual business. Our Conferences segment has been impacted the most by COVID-19. Because of government mandates and health concerns, we were able to hold only a limited number of conferences during Q1. With this situation, we're now planning to hold 17 destination conferences later this year out of our original full year plan of 77. This, as well as our reduced events schedule, will reduce our expected revenues from our Conferences business. Based on the reduced expected revenues from this segment, we've taken steps to reduce costs, including staff reductions. Our conferences provide tremendous value to both attendees and exhibitors. We're in constant contact with our exhibitors. They continue to have a high level of interest and are ready to return when it's safe to do so. There's a similar level of interest among potential attendees. We're carefully developing changes in our conferences to increase safety, such as sanitization standards, additional separations, et cetera. We're also developing virtual conference formats. We held our first virtual conference just last week. That conference, for sales leaders, went from a concept to event, including the marketing for the conference in less than three weeks. There were nine sessions held over a single day. We had more than 1,900 total registrations for this conference. The Net Promoter Score was 77, a strong score, which exceeded our expectations. While we are operationally planning to hold conferences during the latter part of the year, we recognize that this may not be possible due to government mandates or health concerns. As a result, our updated financial guidance assumes that we will be unable to hold these conferences. Looking to the long term, we expect Conferences to continue to be an important contributor to our overall business. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research, and provides clients with a deeper level of involvement through extended project-based work to help them execute their most strategic initiatives. Consulting has also been impacted by COVID-19. Many clients are postponing major new initiatives until they have more clarity as to the impact of the pandemic and the economic downturn. As a result, our backlog was up only 1% during Q1. Looking across our business, during Q1, we closed our offices worldwide for the safety of our associates and to comply with government mandates. Consistent with government guidelines, we've reopened our offices in Shanghai and Beijing. We'll use our experiences with these offices to reopen in other countries when shelter-at-home directives begin to relax. We've taken steps across the business to manage our costs without impairing our ability to drive growth in the future. We've implemented very tight controls in staffing levels, including hiring freezes where appropriate. We reduced staff in our Conferences business, as I mentioned earlier. We significantly cut non-labor spending, and we slowed our capital expenditures such as the build-outs of new office space. The operational changes we made will help ensure we have positive cash flow. In addition, we're tightly managing our financial operations functions to positively impact cash flows. We've also taken steps to help ensure we maintain adequate liquidity. We ended the quarter with $228 million in cash. On April 1, we drew an additional $300 million from our revolver, and we have another $700 million of capacity available. Finally, we've negotiated an amendment to our credit facility with financial covenants that gives us improved flexibility. We will come out of the recession strong and well positioned to continue driving long-term sustained double-digit growth. We continue to have vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. We'll continue to maintain and improve our core capabilities to capture our market opportunity while carefully managing our cost structure and cash flow. We plan to maintain and improve our analyst and adviser capability for developing highly valuable research insights, and strong services capability to meet client needs. We plan to maintain and improve our sales coverage and capacity, while taking this opportunity to address underperforming sales territories. We will remain agile, so we're prepared for whatever may come next. In summary, as we navigate the uncertainties of this unique environment, these are the three messages you could take away from our discussion today: we are well positioned to help our clients address the pandemic and economic downturn; we've taken steps to carefully manage our costs and cash flow in response to the economic downturn; and we will come out of the recession strong and well positioned to resume driving long term, sustained double-digit growth. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Craig Safian. Yes, sure. I'll take the first part \u2013 go ahead, Craig. Well go ahead. Go ahead, Craig. Yes. I mean, again, Gary, quick on here, we didn't have a target in terms of margin that we were aiming for. We basically wanted to build in sufficient flexibility for the future that we can cover a range of outcomes. And we're very much thinking about what's going to happen in 2020 and 2021, as Craig and I both mentioned in our scripts. And are preparing so that we can return to quite \u2013 we're hoping to be able to return to quite good growth there, but we're prepared for whatever may come. So Tony, we don't have a kind of a quantitative breakdown of those. But I'll give you kind of a qualitative perspective, which is the largest category is the companies that are not directly impacted by COVID-19. Like for example, some notch hotels, things like \u2013 well that's not the largest category. The largest categories are the companies that are not directly impacted, but they might sell things to hotels or sell things to airlines. And so they have some impact on their business. That's the largest category. And then I'd say the second largest category are the companies that are \u2013 in fact, the first of the other two categories are probably equal size, which is the ones that are directly impacted like hotels, restaurants, airlines, things like that. And then equal size would be the companies that are not impacted at all, like if you're selling video conferencing software or you're in certain parts of the media business, like streaming media business, for example. Yes. Craig said in his remarks, we basically, for our guidance, assume no improvement during the year. So we \u2013 if you think about we took the results in March and in April, and said if nothing gets better through the year, what is it going to look like? And so we took our \u2013 think about our new business growth and our retention rates and extra delay to that through the rest of the year with the contracts we have coming up for renewal. And that kind of gives you what happens with business, the Research business. So in terms of timing, when we restart conferences. First, we have two kind of \u2013 what we call destination conferences where people tend to fly in from around the country. So like Orlando is supposed to be one of those. Then we also have our Evanta conferences, which tend to be small with, I think, 50 people at a local event where people don't travel. It could be a dinner, it could be a one-day event. And so first, we expect that the conferences that are more local are more likely to be feasible to hold before we'd be able to hold the large destination conferences. The second thing is that as we assess when is a good time to restart, we're going to get input. Right now, in fact, we have focus groups with both exhibitors and with attendees to get what they think would be necessary for us to restart. And we're using that information as input. We're also going to be looking at what the rest of the world is doing. So if the NFL is having \u2013 going to be having football games in the fall and are \u2013 how do people \u2013 are they comfortable doing that? Is Disneyland or Disney World reopening? And so if you look at kind of \u2013 we're going to look at those kinds of things. And of course, we're going to look at what the health officials say as well. And so it's going to be triangulating what clients and potential attendees would say, looking at what the rest of the world is doing and then looking at what the health risks would be. And then triangulate all that stuff to figure out what we actually do. I'm also imagining that it may not be the same answer around the world. So as you probably know, some of the \u2013 some companies open things like these kinds of events in China already. And so we'll see what happens there and what the health risks are and what the reaction of public is. With regard to \u2013 yes, and so with regard to virtual events, as I mentioned on the call, we've already \u2013 we believe that it's a reasonable bet that our virtual events will be more popular. And so we are experimenting and innovating to look at how do we both hold stand-alone virtual events, but also how do we combine in-person events with virtual events so that if people want to participate, but they are not comfortable in coming virtually and come \u2013 I'm sorry, coming in-person that they can participate virtually. And so we're developing those models now. We're testing them. And I'm optimistic that we'll come up with a good model there. So well, see Andrew, we don't know how fast people are going to come back. And so we're going to have to play that by year. But I do know, as we've done our focus groups that there's a very effect \u2013 it exceeded our expectations, the level of interest that clients have in attending these types of conferences. And so what we find is that there's actually quite a bit of enthusiasm, and people are anxious to be able to and looking forward to be able to turn into these. And obviously, if they don't feel safe, they won't. But still got to cross that threshold, and we don't know when that will occur. But the good news is the underlying demand seems to be there. People still want to come to conferences for all the reasons they have in the past. And so to the extent that we can make the environment comfortable, that will draw them faster. And we're certainly doing that. We're looking, like I said is, in terms of ways that we can make the conferences \u2013 or we can hold them in a way that people feel very safe going there. Yes. So George, basically, we don't \u2013 we're going to set GTS headcount based on the productivity we're seeing at an individual territory basis. And so where we see territory, if we \u2013 today, we see territories that are \u2013 have good productivity, we're going to be adding to those territories. And so it's going to be just looking sort of at what's our overall productivity territory by territory? And are there places that we could productively add territories, we'll do that. And so you shouldn't think about that our sales headcount in GTS is frozen for the year. We're going to moderate that headcount based on the productivity we see. So we're in 100 countries around the world. They vary a lot. I don't think there's anything I would take away specifically strongly, like I'll give you two examples. India and Japan have been doing well for us relative to other countries. But I think it's just our execution was just a little bit better there is kind of what I'd put it up to as opposed to us \u2013 as opposed to it. There's something fundamentally different there about the economy or something like that. So as you heard from our call today, as we navigate the uncertainties of our current environment, we are well positioned to help our clients address both the pandemic and the economic downturn. We've taken steps to carefully manage our costs and cash flow in response to the economic downturn. And we're going to come out of the recession strong and well positioned to resume driving long-term sustained double-digit growth. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to David Cohen, Gartner's GVP of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nDavid Cohen: Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for Gartner's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call and hope you are well. With me on the call today are Gene Hall, Chief Executive Officer, and Craig Safian, Chief Financial Officer.

Following comments by Gene and Craig, we will open up the call for your questions. We ask that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up. On the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA are for adjusted EBITDA, but the adjustments as described in our earnings release and the supplement. All growth rates in Gene's comments are FX-neutral, unless stated otherwise. Reconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website. Finally, all contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on 2021 foreign exchange rates unless stated otherwise. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2020 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nGene Hall: Good morning. And thanks for joining us. 2021 was a great year for Gartner. We performed well across the business. Contract value growth accelerated to 16%. We delivered strong performances in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow, and we repurchased almost $1.7 billion of stock. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research segment provides actionable, objective insight to executives and their teams. Our expert guidance and tools enable faster, smarter decisions and stronger performance on an organization's mission critical priorities. We serve leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever. In today's world, client priorities include things like transforming to a digital business, protecting cybersecurity, competing in a war for talent, building a diverse, equitable and inclusive organization, whether and how to return to offices, managing supply chain disruptions and more. So these are really hard problems. And our clients rely on us for insights they can't get anywhere else. Research revenue grew 12% for the full year. Total contract value growth was 16%, at the top end of our medium term outlook. We serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS contract value grew 14% for the full year. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew an impressive 24% for the year. Enterprise leaders and their teams benefit from the same Gartner value proposition regardless of role. We've demonstrated this in technology, supply chain, marketing and now across all the other major functions. We're providing value to our clients and prospects and our focus on relentless execution of proven practices will continue. Our Conferences business also delivered excellent performance in 2021. Conferences revenue grew 78% for the full year. We continue to provide great value for clients through ongoing innovation of our virtual offerings and we returned to in-person Evanta events. As conditions continue to stabilize, we are operationally prepared to return to in-person conferences where and when we can. We'll continue to leverage our profitable virtual conferences as appropriate. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 9% for the full year, with strong performances across the business in 2021. Gartner is a growth company. We have great candidates and continue to invest in our associates in support of future growth. In 2021, we ramped up our recruiting capacity. We're seeing great success in hiring in the challenging labor market. With the rapid acceleration of our business, we have some catch-up hiring and normal growth are in plan for this year. Getting back to our normal growth hiring will position us for long-term, sustained double-digit growth. As we accelerate hiring, we plan to manage sales costs to grow roughly in line with revenue over the long term. A core element of our strategy is to continuously innovate and improve so we get better, faster, stronger every year. We're innovating to provide increasing value to clients through improved user experiences, interactive tools and ever greater insights. We're also continuing to improve our internal processes, so our sales, research and service associates can spend even more time working with clients and prospects. In closing, we performed well in 2021. We expect to deliver a strong performance in 2022. We have a compelling value proposition and a large untapped market opportunity. Over the longer term, we're well positioned to drive strong top line growth with modest margin expansion from our normalized 2021 levels. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income. We'll deploy that cash flow to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and to make strategic tuck-in acquisitions. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Craig?\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene. And good morning. Fourth quarter results were again excellent, with acceleration in our contract value growth rate and strength in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. As our 2022 guidance highlights, we expect double-digit FX-neutral revenue growth and a margin of 20%, even while increasing our hiring and restoring costs to invest for the future. Our financial performance for the full year 2021 included total contract value, up 16%, total revenue growth of 15%, EBITDA growth of 57%, diluted adjusted EPS of $9.22, up 89%, and free cash flow of $1.3 billion, up 53% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year as reported and 18% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, up nearly 100 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $307 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 26% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.99, up 88%. And free cash flow in the quarter was $214 million, down 10% against a very tough compare. Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 17% year-over-year as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. We drove both strong retention and new business in the quarter. Fourth quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, up almost 180 basis points versus 2020. Higher than normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses and lower than planned headcount. For the full year 2021, Research revenues increased by 14% on a reported basis and 12% FX-neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74%, up more than 190 basis points from the prior year. Total contract value or total CV was $4.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 16% versus the prior year. CV growth outperformed our expectations throughout the year. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was a very strong $266 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. Looking at the quarterly NCVI across 2021, we generated more NCVI earlier in the year than we have historically. We also had a higher than normal level of NCVI earlier in the quarters than usual. Both of these timing factors contributed to strong subscription Research revenue in 2021. Total CV growth was led by the manufacturing, services and technology industries. Looking at the roles we serve, technology research, which is sold by our GTS team, accelerated to 14% growth. And all of our GBS practices achieved double-digit growth rates, with the majority growing more than 20% year-over-year. Growth in the fourth quarter was led by the supply chain, HR and sales practices. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 14% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $205 million in the quarter, while retention for GTS was 106% for the quarter, up almost 790 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business was up 17% versus last year. GTS quota-bearing headcount increased by over 80 salespeople sequentially to 3,072. We are seeing the positive effects of our investments to ramp up recruiting capacity combined with moderating attrition. We continue to be successful recruiting new sales people. We expect to see ongoing expansion of the GTS sales team into 2022 and beyond. For 2022, we are planning to grow GTS headcount at double-digit rates. A regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $874 million at the end of the fourth quarter, up 24% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $61 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 115% for the quarter, up about 14 percentage points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 16% compared to last year, reflecting strong growth across the full portfolio. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased sequentially and is up 10% year-over-year. For 2022, we are planning to increase GBS headcount at a double-digit growth rate. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $107 million with reported growth of 15% and 16% FX neutral. Contribution margin in the quarter was 61%. You will recall that in 2020, we ran almost all of our conferences in the fourth quarter, while in 2021, our conferences took place throughout the year. This, plus in-person conference cancellation costs recorded in the quarter resulted in a lower contribution margin year-over-year. We held 13 virtual conferences in the quarter. We held over 140 Evanta meetings, with a mix of both virtual and in-person experiences. For the full year 2021, revenue increased 78%, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. Gross contribution margin was 62%, up more than 14 percentage points from 2020. During 2021, we incurred costs, which would have allowed us to run in-person destination conferences had pandemic conditions permitted. Fourth quarter Consulting revenues increased by 26% year-over-year to $118 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 27%. Consulting contribution margin was 39% in the fourth quarter, up more than 12 percentage points versus the prior year quarter, with strong revenue and the mix benefit from contract optimization. Labor-based revenues were $87 million, up 19% versus Q4 of last year and up 21% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at December 31 was $117 million, increasing 13% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter. Our contract optimization business was up 44% on both a reported and FX-neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. Full year Consulting revenue was up 11% on a reported basis and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. Gross contribution margin of 38% was up over 700 basis points from 2020. Consolidated cost of services increased 14% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. The increase was in part due to higher compensation costs and conference expenses. SG&A increased 27% year-over-year in the fourth quarter on a reported and FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of a $50 million non-recurring real estate charge, higher variable compensation resulting from strong sales and overall business performance, increased hiring across the company and conference cancellation costs. SG&A without the facilities-related charge would have increased 17% year-over-year and would have been 47% of revenue in the quarter. We expect SG&A expenses to increase over time as our hiring across the business continues to ramp. The real estate charge was a result of our decision to reduce our real estate footprint as we shift to a virtual-first workplace strategy. We expect about $20 million of annual benefit beginning in 2022 as a result of the charge. The non-recurring non-cash charge is excluded from EBITDA. We continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio, which may result in additional charges in the future. For the full year, cost of services increased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased 6% on a reported basis and 4% on an FX-neutral basis in 2021. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $307 million, up 25% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 26% FX neutral. EBITDA for the full year was $1.29 billion, a 57% increase over 2020 on a reported basis and up 54% FX neutral. Depreciation in the quarter was about flat versus 2020. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $30 million, up $5 million versus the fourth quarter of 2020 due to an increase in total debt balances. The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was negative 8.3% for the quarter and included a benefit from the intercompany sale of intellectual property. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 24.1% for the quarter. The adjusted tax rate for the full year was 18.1%. Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $2.99. This excludes non-recurring real estate charge. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $9.22. EPS growth for the year was 89%. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 83.8 million. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $235 million, down 10% compared to last year's quarter, which was very strong. On a year-over-year basis, the timing of cash taxes had a sizable impact. Cash flow in the quarter includes $17 million of insurance proceeds from 2020 event cancellations. CapEx for the quarter was $21 million, down 8% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $214 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 23% on a rolling four quarter basis, adjusted for the $167 million of insurance proceeds received during the year. Free cash flow was well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $756 million of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. We repurchased around $1.7 billion in stock during 2021, including about $200 million in the fourth quarter. We repurchased over 7 million shares, reducing our net share count by around 7%. Earlier this month, the Board again increased our share repurchase authorization. We now have around $1 billion available. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. Before providing the 2022 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2022. For Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges. They recognize how Gartner can help. We have demand in good times and bad. Our 2021 performance benefited from several factors, including GBH [ph] tenure mix, NCVI phasing within the quarters and the year, record retention rates and strong non-subscription growth. We're not assuming all of those persist at the same levels through 2022. We've taken a balanced approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we've reflected in the guidance. If NCVI phasing, retention rates and non-subscription growth performed closer to the way they did in 2021, there would be upside to our guidance. In addition, our teams are focused on driving growth faster than what's embedded in the guidance. For Conferences, we are basing our guidance on being 100% virtual for destination conferences for the full year. Destination conferences involve travel, often international and overnight stays for our clients, which can be affected by pandemic conditions and rules. As with 2021, we are operationally planning to re-launch in-person destination conferences when conditions permit. For our local one day Evanta events, we expect to run most of them in person while continuing to run some virtually. As a reminder, we had about $10 million of extra revenue in the first quarter of 2021 related to extending the period for 2020 conference ticket use. In addition, a smaller portion of Research contracts will be attributed to the Conferences segment in 2022. Adjusted for these two items, Conferences revenues would be increasing by about 10%. For consulting revenues, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization is seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect significant headcount increases during the year to support current and future growth. We have modeled higher labor costs and T&E [ph] well above 2021 levels, as we've previously indicated. We will also have higher commissions costs during 2022 as a result of the very strong selling performance we delivered in 2021. Finally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client-facing and internal applications, as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. Our guidance for 2022 is as follows, we expect Research revenue of at least $4.55 billion, which is a reported growth of at least 11% and FX-neutral growth of at least 12%. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $200 million, which is down about 7%, but up about 10% adjusted for the items I mentioned earlier. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $425 million, which is up 2% reported and 3% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.175 billion, which has reported growth of at least 9% and FX-neutral growth of 11%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX headwind of about 150 basis points. We expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.035 billion, which is a decline of about 20%. Based on our revenue and EBITDA guidance, we expect margins of 20%. This is based on Conferences running virtual only and also includes an FX headwind of about 150 basis points. We expect our full year 2022 adjusted net interest expense to be $115 million.  We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2022. As a reminder, the tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Our EPS guidance is based on 83 million weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects repurchases to offset dilution of equity award issuances. We expect 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $6.74. For 2022, we expect free cash flow of at least $850 million. It is also important to note that we have re-valued our contract value at current year FX rates, which had a modest overall impact. Our 2021 ending contract value at 2022 FX rates is $3.3 billion for GTS and $865 million for GBS. Details are included in the appendix of the earnings supplement. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Finally, we expect to deliver at least $285 million of EBITDA in Q1 of 2022. We had a strong year with momentum across the business. Contract value growth accelerated and we had very strong EBITDA, revenue and free cash flow. We have been increasing hiring across the business to drive future growth. We put our capital to work, repurchasing almost $1.7 billion worth of our stock this past year. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from the normalized 2021 level. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time, and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah, thank you. Good morning. Would just love some additional perspective on kind of the delta between the constant currency Research growth you are assuming and the 16% contract value exit rate. And I want to recognize you have the at least methodology, you have the tougher comps. And then beyond that, I guess I just want to see - are there any signs of the demand environment slowing or any sort of slowing? Because your Q4 operational metrics all look really good to me exiting the year. Or is it all about those other factors, as well as the variance sectors that you're calling out on NCVI phasing, non-subs, tenure mix, all of those factors that you referenced?\nGene Hall: Hey, Jeff, it's Gene. I'll get started with the second part of your question, which is, in terms of demand, we're seeing what I would characterize as normal demand and it's consistent with Q4. So demand is very good overall. And I'll turn it over to Craig to answer the more technical aspects.\nCraig Safian: Yes. Thanks, Gene. And good morning, Jeff, sure. So when you step back and look at the relationship between CV growth and revenue, obviously, in a steady-state environment, those two things are pretty close. But when we look at our last couple of years, in 2020, CV grew 4% but Research revenue - or actually, Research revenue in 2021 grew 13%. CV in 2021 grew 16%, and we're guiding to Research revenue growth of 12% FX neutral. Again, as I mentioned, in a typical steady-state environment, CV and the following year research growth rates will generally be similar, not necessarily right on top of each other but relatively similar. As we look at 2022, most but not all of our 2022 revenue dollars are driven by our year-end 2021 contract value dollars. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks and as you alluded to, 2021 did benefit from the tenure mix, the NCVI phasing, not only the quarterly NCVI phasing but the NCVI phasing within the months of the quarter. We had record retention rates. And we also mentioned really, really strong non-subscription growth. And so all those things worked in our favor to get a pretty strong revenue yield in fiscal year 2021. And we're not assuming all of those persist at the same levels that we saw in 2022. And so while CV growth in '21 was at the high end of our medium-term guidance, we're not assuming that we stay all the way at the top of that medium term guidance. And so essentially, what we've done is we've taken a balanced approach based on historical trends and patterns, and we've reflected that in the guidance. As we mentioned, our teams are focused on driving growth that's faster than what's embedded in the guidance. And as we also mentioned in our prepared remarks, if we do perform closer to those 2021 levels on retention rates, NCVI phasing, et cetera, there can potentially be upside to the initial guidance as well.\nJeff Meuler: Great. Appreciate all the detail. And then on margin, the assumed 20%, I guess, how normalized is that number as a baseline to grow off of? And I guess the factors that come to mind on the negative side would be is T&E expense assumed to be fully normalized. And GTS sales head count growth, I think, is probably assumed to be accelerating as the year unfolds. So is that fully normalized or an incremental headwind on the potential for uplift? Can you give us any perspective on if Conferences are in-person, what the incremental margins on that incremental revenue is since you've been planning to operationally have them and have that capacity in the expense base? Thank you.\nCraig Safian: Yes. Sure, Jeff. That's actually three questions buried in one but I'll attempt to tackle them. In terms of the baseline margins or the normalized level of margins, the way to think about it for 2022 is a normalized level would be around 19% to 20%. And you mentioned a lot of the various puts and takes that lead into that range, T&E being one of them, facilities being one of them, the speed at which we can hire and bring people onboard being one of them. But think of normalized margins in the 19% to 20% range as being the baseline from a normalized level of what 2021 should look like. I think as we look to the future, there are really two key points as we think about that normalized level. One, we believe that moving forward, we can grow both the top line at double-digit growth rates and modestly expand margins over time. And number two, the 2021 reported margins are not the starting point. Again, the starting point should be that normalized level of 19% to 20%. On the Conferences side, we are being extraordinarily agile as we attempt to be ready to return to in-person destination conferences when conditions permit. As we think about the incremental revenue and the incremental flow-through on that, our current planning assumption is that because we want to change the experience a bit and have more space per person, if you will that the incremental margins will not be the same as they were pre pandemic. And so the way we are thinking about it right now is that incremental revenue for Conferences, if we're actually able to run in-person destination conferences, would be in the 20% to 25% range in 2022.\nJeff Meuler: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. You touched on this a few times in the prepared remarks but just hoping for an update on recruiting capacity, talent pipeline and whether you've seen any impact on compensation for attracting talent. I know you talked about growing head count by double digits for both GTS and GBS. And just wondering if that contemplates that the hiring environment and attrition normalizes and if you've seen any normalization in like attrition, for example, so far. Or is it still really challenging to hire as many people as you'd like?\nGene Hall: Hey, Toni, it's Gene. So we are a people business. People are the most important thing in our business, period, and so we pay a lot of attention to it. And obviously, as a growth company, recruiting and turnover are really important as well. So we've been - throughout 2021, we grew our recruiting capacity so that we could get - make sure we can keep hiring associates to support our growth going forward. That's going very well. And in fact, we found that we have a very - this is purposeful. We have a very good value proposition in the market for candidates looking for jobs. And so our ability to hire is actually quite good. We're quite attractive, and we've been very pleased with our ability to hire. We're continuing to ramp up and we'll continue to ramp up recruiting capacity because we've got to both do catch-up hiring from last year for all the great business we sold and then also hire people so that we can support growth in 2023 as well. Our pipeline looks really good. Again, our actual recruiting results are doing quite well as well. In terms of compensation, we look very carefully at each of the markets we're in. We're in a number of - a large number of markets globally. Inflation and wage inflation varies widely among those markets. We have modeled that very carefully because we want to make sure we're competitive and have built that into our operating plan and the guidance you've seen.\nToni Kaplan: That's helpful. And I wanted to ask a follow-up on the margin phasing. So should we be thinking about it as the early part of the year has higher EBITDA margins because the hiring will ramp through the year and so the expense on that for the total pool sort of goes up as the year goes on? And I guess T&E can probably ramp up very, very quickly, but just help us think about how margins should look through the year?\nCraig Safian: Yeah. Good morning, Toni. It's a great question. Yes, I think the way you described it is the right way to think about it. Obviously, we actually - to Gene's point, we hired a lot of people in the back half of the year, both in sales but also in research, in service and lots of other areas as well. But I do think that will continue to ramp over the course of the year, and I think T&E will continue to ramp over the course of the year as well. And so probably a little bit higher margin in the first couple of quarters and then moderating in the back half of the year to get to that full year number of around 20%.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the head count expectations for Research. Can you describe which between GTS and GBS you're expecting to grow head count faster in 2022 and then going forward, if you would expect to grow one of the two, GBS for example, faster in terms of head count than the other?\nGene Hall: Yes, George. So the head count is going to grow in line with our contract value growth over time. And so since GBS grew faster in 2021, in order to fulfill that - all the business we've sold, we're going to grow the head count a little faster in GBS than we would at GTS just purely because of the differential growth rates. And that will continue over time.\nGeorge Tong: Great. And then I had a follow-up question on the margins. You mentioned normalized margins for 2022 are going to be 19% to 20%. Would you view 19% to 20% as the new low watermark? Or do you -- are you viewing 20%, which is the guidance for 2022, as the new low watermark going forward, looking beyond this year?\nCraig Safian: Yes. I would consider, George, 19% to 20% to be the level at which we modestly expand our margins on an annual basis moving forward. Again, as I mentioned earlier, our goal, and we believe this and we are aiming towards this, is that we want to grow the business top line double-digit growth rates, modestly expand margins over time. And again, that modest expansion will come off of that 19% to 20% baseline.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. My first question would be just on the virtual-first approach and how hiring in that manner is affecting recruiting, your confidence in being able to hire at a double-digit pace in this labor market. And then to the extent it could be a potential offset to compensation pressures if you're able to kind of target salespeople in different areas that are potentially lower cost, is that part of the idea here? Just your thoughts on kind of virtual-first in the recruiting side.\nGene Hall: Hi, Andrew. So the virtual-first is a core part of our people strategy. In our talent market, we found that both our current associates as well as prospective associates like the idea of an environment where they can work remotely when it makes sense to work remotely but there's still a great office space where they can go work collaboratively as well. And so our virtual-first strategy is about having that mix where if you're -- for example, if you're a software engineer and you're writing code, you might just as well -- you're not really interacting with other people, you may be more effective actually working at a home office than in a normal office environment. Conversely, if you're working on sort of a product development team that's very collaborative and needs to be very agile and working together across multiple functions on a daily basis, you may work more in the office then. And so our virtual-first strategy is basically having kind of the best of both, which is things that make sense to do remotely, you can do remotely; things that make sense to do in the office where you collaborate or developing people, things like that, you actually do it in the office. We found that actually make -- in our industry and with our talent market, that's very attractive to, as I said, both our current associates and when we talk to prospective associates as well. And so in terms of hiring, that's been very effective. In terms of developing people, we've developed new approaches so that we can engage our associates and develop them in a remote environment. I'll also - on that point, even prior to pandemic, a large portion of our associates were remote as well. So all of our field salespeople were remote; many of our service people, remote. So this isn't new to us actually. We just have expanded it to be broader than it was pre pandemic. So we already had experience with it. In terms of -- so we're being very successful in hiring in that kind of environment and developing people. In terms of compensation, basically, we hire people that have the skills where we need them. And part of our strategy is to make sure we hire in attractive labor markets, but it's really more about what are the right skills to meet our clients. And that could be things -- include things like language skills. We try to serve all of our clients in their native languages, for example, with our service people and with our salespeople. And so we look at the mix of both the skills we need, the talent we need and the cost of hiring and balance all those things together to determine where we actually hire people.\nCraig Safian: And Andrew, the one other thing I'd add is, over the back half of the year, we actually made a ton of progress in terms of starting to catch up and starting to make sure that we are hiring to the right levels that we need to support the business. And it's a combination of adding the recruiting capacity, which we talked about and which we've been doing and are getting yield from, and also seeing moderating attrition as well. So the combination of the increase in recruiting capacity and the moderating attrition allowed us to really start to make great progress in getting people onboard over the back half of the year.\nAndrew Nicholas: Got it. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, just - and I apologize if I missed it. Could you speak to what's driving the NCVI phasing intra-quarter or that difference relative to prior periods, if you have any sense for what that is? Thank you.\nCraig Safian: Yes. No, it's a really good question. So the dynamics we saw in 2021 were very different than what we had experienced pre pandemic, in the 10 years leading up to pre pandemic where we had seen pretty consistent NCVI contribution both month one, month two, month three in terms of that mix and then also Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. And if you actually just look at even the headline results for 2021, you'll see that in particular Q2 and Q3 were stronger than the historical proportionality of overall annual NCVI. And I think there are a number of factors driving that, one being we were coming out of very pandemic-impacted year in 2020 and things started to get better from a market perspective as well. And so I think operating blinds [ph] just opened up. People had visibility into what was happening. And people had real problems and they knew Gartner could help, and so that certainly contributed to our ability to drive that NCVI phasing. And I think with -- operationally, our sales teams recognize that getting deals in the door sooner is great for everybody. Locking them up in an uncertain environment is always a better thing to do because you never know what can happen or what danger is lurking around the corner, as they say. And again, the teams did great work on making that happen. As we look at 2021 and we compare it to the decade previous, we didn't want to assume that all of a sudden, we were going to revert exactly to 2021 levels across the board. And so again, just balancing that historical perspective with what we experienced in 2021 is how we built the plan for 2022.\nAndrew Nicholas: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMario Cortellacci: Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Maybe you can just start with how should we think about your market share in the GBS business today and in your verticals, obviously supply chain, marketing, finance, HR. And maybe you can compare that to where the market share sits today for the GTS business?\nGene Hall: Yeah, hi, Mario. So it's -- the way -- I guess the best way to think about it would be if you look at like the total amount of contract value or the total amount of seats in GTS versus in GBS. So in GTS, it's a business that's growing quite rapidly, growing double-digit rates and is much larger than each of the individual practices. In many cases, it's more than 10 times larger than the biggest practices in GBS, for example, HR or finance. And so the opportunity in GBS for each of those practices is to be as big -- HR, finance, sales, customer service, each of those practices has the potential to be as big as our IT end user business. So they can grow more than 10 times as big, each one of them. And so the growth opportunity there is just enormous. And so if you want to think about share in some way, it's extremely small compared to GTS, but still GTS, again, has a huge untapped market potential in and of itself. So the runway for each of the practices in GBS is enormous and is comparable to what we have at the end user side of GTS.\nCraig Safian: And Mario, just to put it in sort of quantitative perspective as well, just to add to that. When we look at our available market opportunity, we see a roughly $55 billion market in the markets that we sell to in GTS. And we've got $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion of that. On the GBS side, we see a market opportunity of close to $145 billion, and we've got under $1 billion of it. So -- and again, as we think about these markets, it's not like we have to steal share of wallet from someone else. We view these as very large, untapped market opportunities for us to go after. And again, that's why we really do believe that we can grow this business at consistent double-digit growth rates into the future, add salespeople, et cetera, because of that -- the market dynamics and the size of the market opportunity.\nMario Cortellacci: Great. Thank you. And then just for my follow-up, within the Consulting business, maybe you can just talk to which verticals or businesses inside of that business have performed better than others. And could you update us on what the competitive dynamic looks like there today? I don't know whether you compete with Robert Half's Protiviti business or any of the other big fours there.\nGene Hall: Yes. So Mario, in our Consulting business, we're actually highly differentiated. The role of our Consulting business is -- the way to think about it is as an extension of our Research business in that there are some clients that want more in-depth and longer engagements with us than we have in our Research business. In Research, we have our written research and other kinds of tools and things. In addition to that, we have the ability to talk to an analyst typically for 0.5 hour at a time. Some companies, particularly large companies, would like more in-depth help from Gartner. And so that's the role of our Consulting business, and it's a very important role and supports our overall business. And so there's no - it's really - think about it as supporting our overall Research business and fulfilling that need for much more in-depth help than you would get from just reading our documents and having shorter calls with analysts.\nMario Cortellacci: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Gene Hall for any closing remarks.\nGene Hall: So as you heard in today's call, we performed well in 2021. We also expect to deliver a strong performance in 2022. We have a compelling value proposition and a large untapped market opportunity. Over the longer term, we're well positioned to drive strong top line growth with modest margin expansion from our normalized 2021 levels. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, and we'll deploy that cash flow to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and to make strategic tuck-in acquisitions. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.+",

            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene. And good morning. Fourth quarter results were again excellent, with acceleration in our contract value growth rate and strength in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. As our 2022 guidance highlights, we expect double-digit FX-neutral revenue growth and a margin of 20%, even while increasing our hiring and restoring costs to invest for the future. Our financial performance for the full year 2021 included total contract value, up 16%, total revenue growth of 15%, EBITDA growth of 57%, diluted adjusted EPS of $9.22, up 89%, and free cash flow of $1.3 billion, up 53% year-over-year. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year as reported and 18% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, up nearly 100 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $307 million, up 25% year-over-year and up 26% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.99, up 88%. And free cash flow in the quarter was $214 million, down 10% against a very tough compare. Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 17% year-over-year as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. We drove both strong retention and new business in the quarter. Fourth quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, up almost 180 basis points versus 2020. Higher than normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses and lower than planned headcount. For the full year 2021, Research revenues increased by 14% on a reported basis and 12% FX-neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74%, up more than 190 basis points from the prior year. Total contract value or total CV was $4.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 16% versus the prior year. CV growth outperformed our expectations throughout the year. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was a very strong $266 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. Looking at the quarterly NCVI across 2021, we generated more NCVI earlier in the year than we have historically. We also had a higher than normal level of NCVI earlier in the quarters than usual. Both of these timing factors contributed to strong subscription Research revenue in 2021. Total CV growth was led by the manufacturing, services and technology industries. Looking at the roles we serve, technology research, which is sold by our GTS team, accelerated to 14% growth. And all of our GBS practices achieved double-digit growth rates, with the majority growing more than 20% year-over-year. Growth in the fourth quarter was led by the supply chain, HR and sales practices. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 14% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $205 million in the quarter, while retention for GTS was 106% for the quarter, up almost 790 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business was up 17% versus last year. GTS quota-bearing headcount increased by over 80 salespeople sequentially to 3,072. We are seeing the positive effects of our investments to ramp up recruiting capacity combined with moderating attrition. We continue to be successful recruiting new sales people. We expect to see ongoing expansion of the GTS sales team into 2022 and beyond. For 2022, we are planning to grow GTS headcount at double-digit rates. A regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $874 million at the end of the fourth quarter, up 24% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $61 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 115% for the quarter, up about 14 percentage points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 16% compared to last year, reflecting strong growth across the full portfolio. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased sequentially and is up 10% year-over-year. For 2022, we are planning to increase GBS headcount at a double-digit growth rate. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $107 million with reported growth of 15% and 16% FX neutral. Contribution margin in the quarter was 61%. You will recall that in 2020, we ran almost all of our conferences in the fourth quarter, while in 2021, our conferences took place throughout the year. This, plus in-person conference cancellation costs recorded in the quarter resulted in a lower contribution margin year-over-year. We held 13 virtual conferences in the quarter. We held over 140 Evanta meetings, with a mix of both virtual and in-person experiences. For the full year 2021, revenue increased 78%, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. Gross contribution margin was 62%, up more than 14 percentage points from 2020. During 2021, we incurred costs, which would have allowed us to run in-person destination conferences had pandemic conditions permitted. Fourth quarter Consulting revenues increased by 26% year-over-year to $118 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 27%. Consulting contribution margin was 39% in the fourth quarter, up more than 12 percentage points versus the prior year quarter, with strong revenue and the mix benefit from contract optimization. Labor-based revenues were $87 million, up 19% versus Q4 of last year and up 21% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at December 31 was $117 million, increasing 13% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter. Our contract optimization business was up 44% on both a reported and FX-neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. Full year Consulting revenue was up 11% on a reported basis and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. Gross contribution margin of 38% was up over 700 basis points from 2020. Consolidated cost of services increased 14% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. The increase was in part due to higher compensation costs and conference expenses. SG&A increased 27% year-over-year in the fourth quarter on a reported and FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of a $50 million non-recurring real estate charge, higher variable compensation resulting from strong sales and overall business performance, increased hiring across the company and conference cancellation costs. SG&A without the facilities-related charge would have increased 17% year-over-year and would have been 47% of revenue in the quarter. We expect SG&A expenses to increase over time as our hiring across the business continues to ramp. The real estate charge was a result of our decision to reduce our real estate footprint as we shift to a virtual-first workplace strategy. We expect about $20 million of annual benefit beginning in 2022 as a result of the charge. The non-recurring non-cash charge is excluded from EBITDA. We continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio, which may result in additional charges in the future. For the full year, cost of services increased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased 6% on a reported basis and 4% on an FX-neutral basis in 2021. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $307 million, up 25% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 26% FX neutral. EBITDA for the full year was $1.29 billion, a 57% increase over 2020 on a reported basis and up 54% FX neutral. Depreciation in the quarter was about flat versus 2020. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $30 million, up $5 million versus the fourth quarter of 2020 due to an increase in total debt balances. The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was negative 8.3% for the quarter and included a benefit from the intercompany sale of intellectual property. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 24.1% for the quarter. The adjusted tax rate for the full year was 18.1%. Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $2.99. This excludes non-recurring real estate charge. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $9.22. EPS growth for the year was 89%. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 83.8 million. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $235 million, down 10% compared to last year's quarter, which was very strong. On a year-over-year basis, the timing of cash taxes had a sizable impact. Cash flow in the quarter includes $17 million of insurance proceeds from 2020 event cancellations. CapEx for the quarter was $21 million, down 8% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $214 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 23% on a rolling four quarter basis, adjusted for the $167 million of insurance proceeds received during the year. Free cash flow was well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $756 million of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. We repurchased around $1.7 billion in stock during 2021, including about $200 million in the fourth quarter. We repurchased over 7 million shares, reducing our net share count by around 7%. Earlier this month, the Board again increased our share repurchase authorization. We now have around $1 billion available. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. Before providing the 2022 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2022. For Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges. They recognize how Gartner can help. We have demand in good times and bad. Our 2021 performance benefited from several factors, including GBH [ph] tenure mix, NCVI phasing within the quarters and the year, record retention rates and strong non-subscription growth. We're not assuming all of those persist at the same levels through 2022. We've taken a balanced approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we've reflected in the guidance. If NCVI phasing, retention rates and non-subscription growth performed closer to the way they did in 2021, there would be upside to our guidance. In addition, our teams are focused on driving growth faster than what's embedded in the guidance. For Conferences, we are basing our guidance on being 100% virtual for destination conferences for the full year. Destination conferences involve travel, often international and overnight stays for our clients, which can be affected by pandemic conditions and rules. As with 2021, we are operationally planning to re-launch in-person destination conferences when conditions permit. For our local one day Evanta events, we expect to run most of them in person while continuing to run some virtually. As a reminder, we had about $10 million of extra revenue in the first quarter of 2021 related to extending the period for 2020 conference ticket use. In addition, a smaller portion of Research contracts will be attributed to the Conferences segment in 2022. Adjusted for these two items, Conferences revenues would be increasing by about 10%. For consulting revenues, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization is seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect significant headcount increases during the year to support current and future growth. We have modeled higher labor costs and T&E [ph] well above 2021 levels, as we've previously indicated. We will also have higher commissions costs during 2022 as a result of the very strong selling performance we delivered in 2021. Finally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client-facing and internal applications, as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. Our guidance for 2022 is as follows, we expect Research revenue of at least $4.55 billion, which is a reported growth of at least 11% and FX-neutral growth of at least 12%. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $200 million, which is down about 7%, but up about 10% adjusted for the items I mentioned earlier. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $425 million, which is up 2% reported and 3% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.175 billion, which has reported growth of at least 9% and FX-neutral growth of 11%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX headwind of about 150 basis points. We expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.035 billion, which is a decline of about 20%. Based on our revenue and EBITDA guidance, we expect margins of 20%. This is based on Conferences running virtual only and also includes an FX headwind of about 150 basis points. We expect our full year 2022 adjusted net interest expense to be $115 million.  We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2022. As a reminder, the tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Our EPS guidance is based on 83 million weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects repurchases to offset dilution of equity award issuances. We expect 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $6.74. For 2022, we expect free cash flow of at least $850 million. It is also important to note that we have re-valued our contract value at current year FX rates, which had a modest overall impact. Our 2021 ending contract value at 2022 FX rates is $3.3 billion for GTS and $865 million for GBS. Details are included in the appendix of the earnings supplement. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Finally, we expect to deliver at least $285 million of EBITDA in Q1 of 2022. We had a strong year with momentum across the business. Contract value growth accelerated and we had very strong EBITDA, revenue and free cash flow. We have been increasing hiring across the business to drive future growth. We put our capital to work, repurchasing almost $1.7 billion worth of our stock this past year. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from the normalized 2021 level. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time, and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Yes. Thanks, Gene. And good morning, Jeff, sure. So when you step back and look at the relationship between CV growth and revenue, obviously, in a steady-state environment, those two things are pretty close. But when we look at our last couple of years, in 2020, CV grew 4% but Research revenue - or actually, Research revenue in 2021 grew 13%. CV in 2021 grew 16%, and we're guiding to Research revenue growth of 12% FX neutral. Again, as I mentioned, in a typical steady-state environment, CV and the following year research growth rates will generally be similar, not necessarily right on top of each other but relatively similar. As we look at 2022, most but not all of our 2022 revenue dollars are driven by our year-end 2021 contract value dollars. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks and as you alluded to, 2021 did benefit from the tenure mix, the NCVI phasing, not only the quarterly NCVI phasing but the NCVI phasing within the months of the quarter. We had record retention rates. And we also mentioned really, really strong non-subscription growth. And so all those things worked in our favor to get a pretty strong revenue yield in fiscal year 2021. And we're not assuming all of those persist at the same levels that we saw in 2022. And so while CV growth in '21 was at the high end of our medium-term guidance, we're not assuming that we stay all the way at the top of that medium term guidance. And so essentially, what we've done is we've taken a balanced approach based on historical trends and patterns, and we've reflected that in the guidance. As we mentioned, our teams are focused on driving growth that's faster than what's embedded in the guidance. And as we also mentioned in our prepared remarks, if we do perform closer to those 2021 levels on retention rates, NCVI phasing, et cetera, there can potentially be upside to the initial guidance as well. Yes. Sure, Jeff. That's actually three questions buried in one but I'll attempt to tackle them. In terms of the baseline margins or the normalized level of margins, the way to think about it for 2022 is a normalized level would be around 19% to 20%. And you mentioned a lot of the various puts and takes that lead into that range, T&E being one of them, facilities being one of them, the speed at which we can hire and bring people onboard being one of them. But think of normalized margins in the 19% to 20% range as being the baseline from a normalized level of what 2021 should look like. I think as we look to the future, there are really two key points as we think about that normalized level. One, we believe that moving forward, we can grow both the top line at double-digit growth rates and modestly expand margins over time. And number two, the 2021 reported margins are not the starting point. Again, the starting point should be that normalized level of 19% to 20%. On the Conferences side, we are being extraordinarily agile as we attempt to be ready to return to in-person destination conferences when conditions permit. As we think about the incremental revenue and the incremental flow-through on that, our current planning assumption is that because we want to change the experience a bit and have more space per person, if you will that the incremental margins will not be the same as they were pre pandemic. And so the way we are thinking about it right now is that incremental revenue for Conferences, if we're actually able to run in-person destination conferences, would be in the 20% to 25% range in 2022. Yeah. Good morning, Toni. It's a great question. Yes, I think the way you described it is the right way to think about it. Obviously, we actually - to Gene's point, we hired a lot of people in the back half of the year, both in sales but also in research, in service and lots of other areas as well. But I do think that will continue to ramp over the course of the year, and I think T&E will continue to ramp over the course of the year as well. And so probably a little bit higher margin in the first couple of quarters and then moderating in the back half of the year to get to that full year number of around 20%. Yes. I would consider, George, 19% to 20% to be the level at which we modestly expand our margins on an annual basis moving forward. Again, as I mentioned earlier, our goal, and we believe this and we are aiming towards this, is that we want to grow the business top line double-digit growth rates, modestly expand margins over time. And again, that modest expansion will come off of that 19% to 20% baseline. And Andrew, the one other thing I'd add is, over the back half of the year, we actually made a ton of progress in terms of starting to catch up and starting to make sure that we are hiring to the right levels that we need to support the business. And it's a combination of adding the recruiting capacity, which we talked about and which we've been doing and are getting yield from, and also seeing moderating attrition as well. So the combination of the increase in recruiting capacity and the moderating attrition allowed us to really start to make great progress in getting people onboard over the back half of the year. Yes. No, it's a really good question. So the dynamics we saw in 2021 were very different than what we had experienced pre pandemic, in the 10 years leading up to pre pandemic where we had seen pretty consistent NCVI contribution both month one, month two, month three in terms of that mix and then also Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. And if you actually just look at even the headline results for 2021, you'll see that in particular Q2 and Q3 were stronger than the historical proportionality of overall annual NCVI. And I think there are a number of factors driving that, one being we were coming out of very pandemic-impacted year in 2020 and things started to get better from a market perspective as well. And so I think operating blinds [ph] just opened up. People had visibility into what was happening. And people had real problems and they knew Gartner could help, and so that certainly contributed to our ability to drive that NCVI phasing. And I think with -- operationally, our sales teams recognize that getting deals in the door sooner is great for everybody. Locking them up in an uncertain environment is always a better thing to do because you never know what can happen or what danger is lurking around the corner, as they say. And again, the teams did great work on making that happen. As we look at 2021 and we compare it to the decade previous, we didn't want to assume that all of a sudden, we were going to revert exactly to 2021 levels across the board. And so again, just balancing that historical perspective with what we experienced in 2021 is how we built the plan for 2022. And Mario, just to put it in sort of quantitative perspective as well, just to add to that. When we look at our available market opportunity, we see a roughly $55 billion market in the markets that we sell to in GTS. And we've got $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion of that. On the GBS side, we see a market opportunity of close to $145 billion, and we've got under $1 billion of it. So -- and again, as we think about these markets, it's not like we have to steal share of wallet from someone else. We view these as very large, untapped market opportunities for us to go after. And again, that's why we really do believe that we can grow this business at consistent double-digit growth rates into the future, add salespeople, et cetera, because of that -- the market dynamics and the size of the market opportunity."

            "name": "Gene Hall",
            "content": "Good morning. And thanks for joining us. 2021 was a great year for Gartner. We performed well across the business. Contract value growth accelerated to 16%. We delivered strong performances in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow, and we repurchased almost $1.7 billion of stock. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research segment provides actionable, objective insight to executives and their teams. Our expert guidance and tools enable faster, smarter decisions and stronger performance on an organization's mission critical priorities. We serve leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever. In today's world, client priorities include things like transforming to a digital business, protecting cybersecurity, competing in a war for talent, building a diverse, equitable and inclusive organization, whether and how to return to offices, managing supply chain disruptions and more. So these are really hard problems. And our clients rely on us for insights they can't get anywhere else. Research revenue grew 12% for the full year. Total contract value growth was 16%, at the top end of our medium term outlook. We serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS contract value grew 14% for the full year. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew an impressive 24% for the year. Enterprise leaders and their teams benefit from the same Gartner value proposition regardless of role. We've demonstrated this in technology, supply chain, marketing and now across all the other major functions. We're providing value to our clients and prospects and our focus on relentless execution of proven practices will continue. Our Conferences business also delivered excellent performance in 2021. Conferences revenue grew 78% for the full year. We continue to provide great value for clients through ongoing innovation of our virtual offerings and we returned to in-person Evanta events. As conditions continue to stabilize, we are operationally prepared to return to in-person conferences where and when we can. We'll continue to leverage our profitable virtual conferences as appropriate. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 9% for the full year, with strong performances across the business in 2021. Gartner is a growth company. We have great candidates and continue to invest in our associates in support of future growth. In 2021, we ramped up our recruiting capacity. We're seeing great success in hiring in the challenging labor market. With the rapid acceleration of our business, we have some catch-up hiring and normal growth are in plan for this year. Getting back to our normal growth hiring will position us for long-term, sustained double-digit growth. As we accelerate hiring, we plan to manage sales costs to grow roughly in line with revenue over the long term. A core element of our strategy is to continuously innovate and improve so we get better, faster, stronger every year. We're innovating to provide increasing value to clients through improved user experiences, interactive tools and ever greater insights. We're also continuing to improve our internal processes, so our sales, research and service associates can spend even more time working with clients and prospects. In closing, we performed well in 2021. We expect to deliver a strong performance in 2022. We have a compelling value proposition and a large untapped market opportunity. Over the longer term, we're well positioned to drive strong top line growth with modest margin expansion from our normalized 2021 levels. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income. We'll deploy that cash flow to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and to make strategic tuck-in acquisitions. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Craig? Hey, Jeff, it's Gene. I'll get started with the second part of your question, which is, in terms of demand, we're seeing what I would characterize as normal demand and it's consistent with Q4. So demand is very good overall. And I'll turn it over to Craig to answer the more technical aspects. Hey, Toni, it's Gene. So we are a people business. People are the most important thing in our business, period, and so we pay a lot of attention to it. And obviously, as a growth company, recruiting and turnover are really important as well. So we've been - throughout 2021, we grew our recruiting capacity so that we could get - make sure we can keep hiring associates to support our growth going forward. That's going very well. And in fact, we found that we have a very - this is purposeful. We have a very good value proposition in the market for candidates looking for jobs. And so our ability to hire is actually quite good. We're quite attractive, and we've been very pleased with our ability to hire. We're continuing to ramp up and we'll continue to ramp up recruiting capacity because we've got to both do catch-up hiring from last year for all the great business we sold and then also hire people so that we can support growth in 2023 as well. Our pipeline looks really good. Again, our actual recruiting results are doing quite well as well. In terms of compensation, we look very carefully at each of the markets we're in. We're in a number of - a large number of markets globally. Inflation and wage inflation varies widely among those markets. We have modeled that very carefully because we want to make sure we're competitive and have built that into our operating plan and the guidance you've seen. Yes, George. So the head count is going to grow in line with our contract value growth over time. And so since GBS grew faster in 2021, in order to fulfill that - all the business we've sold, we're going to grow the head count a little faster in GBS than we would at GTS just purely because of the differential growth rates. And that will continue over time. Hi, Andrew. So the virtual-first is a core part of our people strategy. In our talent market, we found that both our current associates as well as prospective associates like the idea of an environment where they can work remotely when it makes sense to work remotely but there's still a great office space where they can go work collaboratively as well. And so our virtual-first strategy is about having that mix where if you're -- for example, if you're a software engineer and you're writing code, you might just as well -- you're not really interacting with other people, you may be more effective actually working at a home office than in a normal office environment. Conversely, if you're working on sort of a product development team that's very collaborative and needs to be very agile and working together across multiple functions on a daily basis, you may work more in the office then. And so our virtual-first strategy is basically having kind of the best of both, which is things that make sense to do remotely, you can do remotely; things that make sense to do in the office where you collaborate or developing people, things like that, you actually do it in the office. We found that actually make -- in our industry and with our talent market, that's very attractive to, as I said, both our current associates and when we talk to prospective associates as well. And so in terms of hiring, that's been very effective. In terms of developing people, we've developed new approaches so that we can engage our associates and develop them in a remote environment. I'll also - on that point, even prior to pandemic, a large portion of our associates were remote as well. So all of our field salespeople were remote; many of our service people, remote. So this isn't new to us actually. We just have expanded it to be broader than it was pre pandemic. So we already had experience with it. In terms of -- so we're being very successful in hiring in that kind of environment and developing people. In terms of compensation, basically, we hire people that have the skills where we need them. And part of our strategy is to make sure we hire in attractive labor markets, but it's really more about what are the right skills to meet our clients. And that could be things -- include things like language skills. We try to serve all of our clients in their native languages, for example, with our service people and with our salespeople. And so we look at the mix of both the skills we need, the talent we need and the cost of hiring and balance all those things together to determine where we actually hire people. Yeah, hi, Mario. So it's -- the way -- I guess the best way to think about it would be if you look at like the total amount of contract value or the total amount of seats in GTS versus in GBS. So in GTS, it's a business that's growing quite rapidly, growing double-digit rates and is much larger than each of the individual practices. In many cases, it's more than 10 times larger than the biggest practices in GBS, for example, HR or finance. And so the opportunity in GBS for each of those practices is to be as big -- HR, finance, sales, customer service, each of those practices has the potential to be as big as our IT end user business. So they can grow more than 10 times as big, each one of them. And so the growth opportunity there is just enormous. And so if you want to think about share in some way, it's extremely small compared to GTS, but still GTS, again, has a huge untapped market potential in and of itself. So the runway for each of the practices in GBS is enormous and is comparable to what we have at the end user side of GTS. Yes. So Mario, in our Consulting business, we're actually highly differentiated. The role of our Consulting business is -- the way to think about it is as an extension of our Research business in that there are some clients that want more in-depth and longer engagements with us than we have in our Research business. In Research, we have our written research and other kinds of tools and things. In addition to that, we have the ability to talk to an analyst typically for 0.5 hour at a time. Some companies, particularly large companies, would like more in-depth help from Gartner. And so that's the role of our Consulting business, and it's a very important role and supports our overall business. And so there's no - it's really - think about it as supporting our overall Research business and fulfilling that need for much more in-depth help than you would get from just reading our documents and having shorter calls with analysts. So as you heard in today's call, we performed well in 2021. We also expect to deliver a strong performance in 2022. We have a compelling value proposition and a large untapped market opportunity. Over the longer term, we're well positioned to drive strong top line growth with modest margin expansion from our normalized 2021 levels. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, and we'll deploy that cash flow to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and to make strategic tuck-in acquisitions. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nGene Hall: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Our growth increased again in the third quarter. We're performing well across the business. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. Total Company revenues were up 15% in Q3 with continued momentum across all three of our business segments. We also repurchased another $355 million in stock in the quarter. Bringing our year-to-date total through October to $1.6 billion and we're thriving in the current environment. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our research segment provides actionable, objective insight to executives and their teams. Reserve leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes, and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever. Everywhere around the world, our clients are facing more issues than ever before.  Challenging issues, things like the future of work, cybersecurity, carbon footprint, digital business, diversity, equity inclusion, Cloud and more. Our research is closely aligned to our client's priorities. We recently launched a new sustainability resource center that provides clients and prospects with actual insights on sustainable business strategy. Total research contract value growth increased to 14% with acceleration in both GTS and GBS driven by strong execution in both retention and new business. Global Technology Sales or GTS, returned to double-digit growth. GTS contract value growth accelerated to 12%. We expect GTS to deliver long-term, sustained double-digit contract value growth. Global Business Sales or GBS, delivered another outstanding quarter with contract value growth of 22%. All practices across GBS drove double-digit contract value growth. Across our entire research business, we're driving consistent execution of proven practices. And we continue to see the results of our efforts. Our conferences business also continues to deliver excellent performance. In 2020, we developed an entirely new conferences business model. This model leverages virtual conferences to deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to our audiences. We delivered a strong performance in conferences.  For the third quarter of 2021, conferences revenues were $24 billion. Total attendee numbers were up in Q3, as we are increasing our reach through our valuable content. There's a large constituency of our clients and prospects who prefer in-person conferences.  We've recently held some in-person event in advance which were very well received. As conditions continue to stabilize, we are operationally prepared to return to in-person conferences where and when we can. We'll continue to leverage our profitable virtual conferences as appropriate. Carter Consulting is an extension of Gartner research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business.  Consulting revenues grew 6% in Q3. So overall, we're performing really well as a Company. We're thriving in our current environments. We're able to serve our clients and sell the prospects very effectively in a virtual environment. Most of our associates appreciate working virtually. They would like some in-person interactions with their colleagues when that's the best way to engage with each other and get work done. We've created an operating model that supports virtual and in-person interactions. And these gives our associates flexibility, while promoting activities to drive associate engagement. We've also ramped up our recruiting function to support long-term sustained double-digit growth. We're seeing great success in hiring during one of the toughest labor markets ever. Finally, we're taking steps to make the associate experience at Gartner even better.  We're a growth Company. We're focused on ensuring our associates have clear and compelling career paths. We're helping our managers and leaders have powerful career development conversations with their teams. We continue to improve on our proven practices and we're innovating processes and technology to streamline operations. In closing, Gartner delivered another strong performance in Q3. We're performing well across all 3 of our business segments. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. And we repurchased another $355 million of stock in the quarter. We continue to get better, faster, stronger as a Company. Gartner is a great place to be for our associates. We deliver extraordinary value to our current clients. We provide outstanding returns for our shareholders. And we're thriving in the current environment. With that, I will hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Craig?\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene. And good morning. Third quarter results were again excellent with acceleration in contract value growth and strength in revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q3 performance. Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion of 16% year-over-year as reported, and 15% FX-neutral.  In addition, total contribution margin was 69% up more than 200 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $305 million up 82% year-over-year and up 80% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.03 and free cash flow in the quarter was $331 million. Research revenue in the third quarter grew 16% year-over-year as reported and 15% on an FX-neutral basis. We drove both strong retention and new business in the quarter. Third-quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, up over 200 basis points versus 2020. Higher-than-normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses, and lower than planned headcount. Total contract value grew 14% FX-neutral year-over-year to $4 billion at September 30th. Quarterly Net Contract Value Increase or NCVI was a very strong $146 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric.  Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, up almost 12% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $102 million from the second quarter. CV growth was led by the technology, manufacturing, and retail industries. While retention for GTS was 104% for the quarter, up 490 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business was up 25% versus last year with strong growth in new logos and expansion with existing client enterprises. GTS quota-bearing headcount increased from the second quarter.  We are beginning to see the positive effects of our investments to ramp up recruiting capacity. We continue to be successful recruiting new salespeople. Turnover among GTS front-line sellers is stable at the modestly elevated range we saw in the second quarter. With increased recruiting capacity and stable turnover, we expect to see continued expansion of the GTS sales team in Q4 and into 2022 and beyond. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global business sales contract value was $814 million at the end of the third quarter, up 22% year-over-year, which is above the high-end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $43 million from the second quarter. Broad-based CV growth included particular strength in the healthcare, technology and services industries.  All of our GBS practices achieved double-digit growth rates with the majority growing more than 20% year-over-year. Growth in the third quarter was led by the supply chain, HR, and sales practices. While retention for GBS was 113% for the quarter, up more than 14% points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 38% compared to last year, reflecting strong growth across the full portfolio. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased sequentially and is up 8% year-over-year. As with GTS, our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the third quarter was $24 million with reported growth of 92% and 93% FX-neutral. Contribution margin in the quarter was 47%. We held 8 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual and the meetings. We were able to reintroduce in-person event and meetings in the quarter and plan to ramp those up in Q4. Attendance is up significantly year-over-year as we've launched more virtual conferences to cover additional roles. Third quarter consulting revenues increased by 6% year-over-year to $95 million, on an FX-neutral basis, revenues were also up 6%. Consulting contribution margin was 33% in third quarter, up more than 110 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. Labor-based revenues were $78 million, up 5% versus Q3 of last year, and up 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 749 was up 2%, utilization was 62% up more than 130 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at September 30th was $126 million, increasing 27% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter.  Our contract optimization business was up 13% on a reported basis versus the prior-year quarter and up 12% FX-neutral. As we've detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly valuable. Consolidated cost of services increased 9% year-over-year and 8% FX-neutral in the third quarter. SG&A decreased 2% year-over-year and 3% FX during the third quarter. The year-over-year decline is largely related to the timing of certain prior-year expenses.  We expect SG&A expenses to increase over time as our hiring across the business continues to ramp. Total operating expenses were lower than planned because conferences continued to be virtual. We are resuming business travel and reopening offices at a very deliberate pace. And we're still ramping up or net growth hiring to our target levels. EBITDA for the third quarter was $305 million, up 82% year-over-year on a reported basis, and up 80% FX-neutral. Third quarter EBITDA again, reflected revenue above the high-end and cost towards the low-end of our expectations. Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, reflecting real estate and software which went into service since the third quarter of last year. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $30 million, up slightly versus the third quarter of 2020 due to an increase in total debt balances.  The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25.2% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust that income was 25.4% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.03. Weighted average fully diluted share count for the 3rd quarter was 84.8 million shares. We exited the quarter with 84.2 million fully diluted shares. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $345 million up 41% compared to last year. Cash flow strength continues to be driven by EBITDA growth and improved collections. Capex for the quarter was $14 million down 5% year-over-year. Lower capex is largely a function of lower real estate investments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $331 million.  Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest capital expense through needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 25% on a rolling four-quarter basis, adjusted for the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter. Free cash flow was well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. At the end of the third quarter, we had $766 million of cash. Our September 30th debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2 times. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy, of share of repurchases, and strategic tuck-in M&A.  Through the end of October, we have repurchased more than $1.6 billion in stock this year, including $355 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased over 7 million shares, reducing our net share count by around 7%. As of November 1st, we have around $600 million remaining on our repurchase authorization, which we expect the board will refresh as needed. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are updating our full-year guidance to reflect Q3 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. For revenue guidance, we now expect Research revenue of at least $4.07 billion, which is growth of 13%. We now expect Conferences revenue of at least $190 million, which is growth of 58%. We still expect Consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of 6%.  The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.66 billion, which is growth of 14%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX -benefit of about 190 basis points. This reflects modest headwinds from FX in the fourth quarter. For expenses we are investing in expanding our recruiting capacity to drive additional hiring across the entire business, including our sales teams. The additional hiring will continue into 2022 and beyond to support current and future growth. We plan to exit the year with quota-bearing headcount about flat for GTS. We expect low double-digit growth for GBS by the end of 2021.  Additionally, we continue to invest in a number of programs with a focus on improving sales productivity and cost effectiveness. We're also incurring some conference cancellation fees in the fourth quarter and during the process of reopening dozens of offices as well. We now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1.6 billion, which is an increase of about 54% versus 2020 and reflects reported margins of 27%.  Consistent with our comments last quarter, we estimate that normalized 2021 margins would be around 19%, if this had been a more typical year. About 2/3 of the adjustments are headcount related with most of the rest from travel and real estate. We expect our full-year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $113 million. Looking out to 2022 as the balance sheet stands today, we expect interest expense to be around $115 million.  We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $8.54. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.2 to $5 billion. This includes the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter this year. All the details of our full-year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. We had a strong 3rd quarter with momentum across the business. Contract value growth accelerated, and we had very strong revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow in the quarter. We've put our capital to work, repurchasing more than $1.6 billion worth of our stock this year through the end of October. And we've updated our guidance to reflect continuing strength and momentum in the business. Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged.  With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales cost growing in line with CV growth over time, and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest capex needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time and strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the Operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeff Mueller with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. So great to see sales headcount back to growth and fully hear you on the investments you're making in recruiting capacity and the payback you're seeing on that. I guess my question is, at what point does the sales headcount growth in GTS need to step up meaningfully, or how much capacity is remaining in the system where you can continue to drive this type of growth? Just -- like is it quarters? Is there -- just trying to understand how much leeway you have before you really need to hit the gas on sales headcount.\nGene Hall: Hey, Jeff. Gene. So first, the -- we do have a lot of headcounts and 1 of the leverage that we used for growth, but it's not the only lever. We also early are very focused on productivity and we believe there's quite a bit of room for productivity improvements going forward. In parallel with that, as I mentioned on the call and Craig did as well. We have initiatives underway to ramp up our recruiting capacity and output and refining actually we have a great value proposition, is very attractive markets. And so we're quite optimistic about our ability to ramp up hiring as we need to leverage productivity anytime.\nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then can you help me with some of the GTS metrics? It looks like most of the growth is coming from client enterprise growth, CV per enterprise flattish, despite having a 104% wallet retention. So I don't know to what extent there's sales head count mix impact -- if there is post-COVID win back -- just help me understand what's going on and is it a good thing that most of the growth is coming from client enterprises, given that you can expand after you land.\nCraig Safian: Good morning, Jeff. I think there's a couple of ways to look at what's happening under the covers. I think number 1, seeing the pickup in world attention is certainly a very positive trend which we anticipated. And as we've looked at the amount of up sell and expansion that we're driving within existing client enterprises, we're back to normal levels. While our retention is strongest, not quite back to historical levels, but we feel really good about the level of expansion we're driving within existing enterprises.  Again, some of that is when back, some of that is organic growth activities within existing enterprises. But while it is pretty strong, I think on the enterprise account, enterprise growth, we've seen now few quarters, enterprises expanding. And as you'd expect, when a new enterprise comes in, it comes in at a lower CV level than our overall average. And so the net enterprise adds that we've been doing will suppress a little bit or mute a little bit the CV for Enterprise that you see. And what you are seeing actually is both levers working really well for the last several quarters, particularly in the third quarter, with that expansion, with the existing enterprises showing up in a low retention number and the number of enterprises growing nicely as well.\nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nGary Bisbee: Hey, good morning, guys. I guess if I go back to GTS headcount, what's really kept you from bringing that back more quickly? I know last quarter you talked about having to ramp up recruiting capacity to deliver on that but how much is the tight labor market impacting the pace at which you bring people back and what's the risk in the next 6 months that you continue to have, sort of sluggish additions? How do we think about that? And when would that impact revenue growth in the segment if you don't get that up towards high-single-digits or wherever you're targeting? Thank you.\nGene Hall: Hey, Gary. A couple of things going on with GTS headcount. First, it is a highly competitive labor market and sort of the turnover is up modestly. And of course they're within the modestly higher turnover. Their pockets are hired to modest turnover, but overall it's modestly up. And we recognize that and we have a number of programs in place which we think will actually address that. We have a very good -- and we have a very strong employee value proposition. In fact, we don't have any trouble recruiting people into the Company.  And so the combination of continuing to strengthen our employee value proposition, we believe will get churn of this modest, high turnover back to normal levels in an [Indiscernible] that we are rapidly ramping up are recruiting capacity as I mentioned. We had just started ramping up recruiting capacity back in May, but obviously what happens is you start -- you've got to hire recruiters. It takes a while to actually get them on the job, and then just like any other job, it takes recruiters some time to get up to full capacity.  And so when we started ramping up recruiting capacity back in May, it takes a little time before that definitely kicks in. As Craig mentioned on the script, on his prepared remarks. We're already seeing that we're back to kind of the levels of hiring that we were back in 2019. Again, we expect that to continue to go up. So we expect a combination of improved employee turnover from the programs we have in place, combined with higher recruiting capacity to really address this issue.\nGary Bisbee: Okay. That's helpful. And then on GBS, outstanding productivity there, I guess on the back of outstanding new business over the last four quarters or five quarters now. How should we think about productivity? And I'm not asking Q4 or even next year like over the next few years, the LTM right now is way ahead of what, it's ever been in GTS, I guess one could argue you've got multiple franchises that you're selling there, and so it could be higher. But there's also a lot of factors have improved. Would it be reasonable to think that it gravitates back towards where GTS has been historically, or do you believe you can keep this level of productivity or at least higher just because of the number of shots on goal you've got with the different practice areas are selling? Thank you.\nGene Hall: In GTS, like GBS have a great value proposition. We provide actual insights to our clients on their toughest issues. So we start -- I think what we start with is we have a really great high proposition. As we talked about, we invested in making sure we had the content, sales training, a number of experts, etc. over the last really 2 or 3 years to make sure that we had all the pieces in place to have to be able deliver that incredible value proposition. And now we're seeing the benefits of that. We're going to continue to keep investing in those areas and so I'd expect our value proposition which is very strong. And also get our ability to execute on sales will continue to be very strong as well.\nCraig Safian: The other thing I know carriers in that net productivity number you're seeing it's as you called out. Really strong new business growth, but we've also seen meaningful improvements in the retention rates. And that obviously flows through to the NCVI per quota-bearing head as well. So it underscores [Indiscernible] points around the value proposition being super strong. So not only are we getting lots of shots on goal, as you say across the franchises, we're going those levels. I guess if I said the metaphor and keeping those seat holders in the franchise with stronger retention rates.\nGary Bisbee: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. Actually, just want to ask a follow-up on the last topic. So on GBS, you mentioned how you're seeing growth driven by supply chain and HR and sales practices. No surprise there. Those have been the topics really impacting many companies right now. Are these really new clients subscriptions or add - ons from existing clients for the most part and do you view any of that as temporary, so like, if supply issues are the -- like supply chain issues are doing, for example, would those clients still stay on or could you see a little bit of a higher turnover of those clients?\nCraig Safian: Good morning, Toni. It's Craig. I think across all the GBS practices, as we mentioned, all of them are at double-digit growth rates on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter and more than half of them are north of 20% year-over-year growth. So we highlighted the top 3 which are performing really strongly, but that's not -- those aren't the only ones that are even north of 20% and again, to underscore the point, all of them are at double-digit growth rates. I think what we're seeing, and you can see this through a combination of metrics is we are selling a lot of new functions within existing enterprises.  Which is why you've seen a wild retention rate move up as nicely as it has. And so just because the client is purchasing supply chain subscription, selling into their finance team or their HR team with our legal team is a brand new sale for us. And we're doing really, really well there and in addition to you bringing on brand new enterprises into the GBS franchise as well. It's a combination of those two factors really driving that GBS growth. On cyclical versus secular. I think I go back to James' points earlier. We have a really, really strong value proposition in each of these functional areas that we are selling into. We've invested a lot over the last several years to make sure that we've got the right content and the right analysts and advisors, and the right service capacity in the right selling capacity. And so we feel good about each of these opportunities. Again, if you scan back, I mean these are enormous market opportunities for us and we're in the really, really, really innings on going after that market opportunity.\nToni Kaplan: That's great. Wanted to ask about the pace of expenses returning things the way that I'm sort of thinking about it is. You have T&E and hiring that are going to make up probably some of the bigger buckets of returning costs and I know you talked about hiring a lot, so I'll skip that one, but just on T&E, I guess. How far back are you at this point versus what is fully back and versus pre - COVID? Like is the level sort of lower? And maybe the easier way to ask it is you talked about the 19% baseline for adjusted EBITDA margin this year. So modest growth off of that next year, is that how we should be thinking about '22 or could you see costs more gradually come back and we sort of are stuck in a situation like -- we had this year where you're a little bit over earning on the margin next year.\nCraig Safian: I think that's a great question. A couple ways to think about it. So one, the biggest bucket by far is headcount related. And as we talked about, we are making progress there. We've increased recruiting capacity as Gene talked about, we're growing both sales forces now sequentially and we intend to do that not only with sales, but across the rest of the Company as needed as well. That is by far the biggest piece of it I think as I mentioned. I've prepared remarks about two-thirds of the quote and quote normalizing adjustments relate to headcount.  On the travel front, we are still almost at zero. And so there is still a long way to bounce back from that. When we were sitting here in May, we thought, second half of the year, it would start to bounce back. When we were sitting here in August, we saw in the fourth quarter, it would bounce back. It is reopening a little bit, but we are still at a tiny fraction of where we were historically. And as we roll into 2022, we do think it will rebound to reset at a new normal level. Will that be all the way back to 2019? Perhaps not. Perhaps there are things we can do a little more efficiently and effectively, but it's still going to be a pretty significant step-up from what we spent in 2021, which is virtually nothing, back to a new normal level in 2022.\nToni Kaplan: Super helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to stay on GBS productivity. GBS and CPI, a $176,000 really come significantly above what we're seeing in GBS even before COVID and you mentioned strong new business growth, and an improved retention is drivers. Were there any unusual tailwinds to put activity or seasonality factors to consider in the quarter? How sustainable are current levels of productivity?\nGene Hall: Good morning, George. Productivity, it is an [Indiscernible] measure and so we're trying to even out or take out seasonality from the measure. There are some structural differences that we've talked about in the past -- in looking at GBS compared to GTS. And again, based on where we are in the journey on these two businesses. And so on GBS side, because we are, as I mentioned earlier in the really early innings of going after this really enormous market opportunity. We have a racer mix of what we call business developers or hunters whose sole job is to go out and find new business. And they're performing really, really well, and have been.  And we've been building to that. It wasn't just a 1 quarter phenomenon, let's say, several quarter multi-year phenomenon that we've been experiencing there. And so again, they are performing really well, the retention levels are helping a lot on the types of quota-bearing hires or AEs that managed CV and drive growth through expansion. So it's really a combination of those 2 things. As we look at the future, is this the right level to think about?  We will see, I mean, there is -- we do believe there was a little bit of pent-up demand out there in the market coming through the pandemic last year. But we feel like we're in a really good place with GBS achieving strong growth rates. And again, through a combination of really strong new business and improving retention rates as well.\nGeorge Tong: That's helpful. You mentioned normalized EBITDA margins are running at 19% and this is a little bit improved from previously, it was running at 18% to 19%. Can you discuss where in the business you're seeing improved cost profiles.\nGene Hall: Yes, George, it's actually a combination of improved spread revenue outlook and performance and some improved cost profiles as well, is really driving both the modest adjustment from 18% to 19% to where we are now which is around 19%. But I guess, generally, the way to think about a normalized margin of around 19% is, it is how our P&L would look at a more typical year with sales headcount growing a few points lower than CV, offices opened for the full year, normal travel levels as we just discussed on Toni question, and growth investment to support all the growth that we're driving across the business. And so a modest change. But again, I'd say a combination of the revenue performing a little bit better than expected as we've talked about each quarter. And some tightening or more efficiency on the cost side as well.\nGeorge Tong: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. I'll start with conferences. I realized that you are only in the early stages of reintroducing in-person conferences and events. But I'm wondering if you have an updated view on the long-term mix of conferences between in-person and virtual particularly as we start to plan for 2022. And then given even more experience today than the past couple of quarters with the virtual format, whether you have any additional clarity on the profitability of that model, the hybrid model, longer-term relative to pre -pandemic levels.\nGene Hall: Hey, Andrew, great question. Conferences are important part of our business. And we have -- with the pandemic, developed quite good virtual conferences that have a lot of value to our clients and our [Indiscernible] received. Having said that, a lot of our clients want to, in particular, used to go to in-person conference, as we do our customer research, there is strong interest and desire for us to provide them with in-person conferences as well. So the look of future, right now, the way we are thinking is we would -- whether it is safe to do so that allowed in each geographic area range for environment.  We will -- we plan to hold in-person conferences because it does provide tremendous value to our clients. And having said that, we also plan to continue with virtual conferences for those clients that either don't want to travel or can't travel, given when we have our in-person conferences. And so our long-term strategy, our long-term plan is to have a mix of both in-person conferences and virtual conferences. Going back to kind of the great success we had with the in-person ones combined with what we learned in the pandemic for the virtual conferences.\nAndrew Nicholas: Got it. Thank you. Is there anything you can say about the profitability differences between those 2 or what the profitability of that hybrid model looks like?\nGene Hall: You know Andrew, it's hard to say now. Just we've been operating a little bit in between the 2 models as we've -- as you know we were preparing to run a portion of our conferences this year in-person. And so we add staff onboard to be able to do that. And then obviously, we had to cancel those in-person conferences in the fourth quarter and relaunched our virtual -- And so again, I think the way we think about it is, the contribution margin will look similar to the way it looked pre -pandemic for the overall conferences business.  I do think and again, we'll provide guidance on 25 in February. We're working through our operational plans now. But we -- and again, we've talked about this in the past, we are not going to be in a position to relaunch the 70 inverse definition conferences that we had in 2019, run them at the exact same profile economic and otherwise in 2022 it's going to takes some time to build back into those. And so again, as we think about it, the combined operating margin for conferences looks pretty similar to the way it looks a lot prior to the pandemic, as it stands right now.\nAndrew Nicholas: That's really helpful. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, it looks like it looking at the Q that United States and Canada are growing a little bit faster than EMEA and the rest of the international business. Although it's certainly a small gap. Just wondering if you could speak to the different market dynamics in the U.S. versus internationally. And if there's anything specific, whether it's the selling motion or the receptiveness to the new products that you would call out between those regions. Thank you.\nGene Hall: So let me start on that, Andrew. So the first thing is GBS is largely weighted to the U.S. And so most of the GBS growth just because of it is much less mature outside U.S., even in the U.S., it's going to be we're heavily U.S. weighted. It's going well outside the U.S. as well but it's just a share of business, our share of salespeople are overwhelming U.S. Over time, just as we've done GTS, we expect to have our international markets and GBS be just strongly staff as we have GTS today. As we keep debt and salespeople over time. And so that's one of the factors to drives the U.S. markets. In terms of actual our value proposition is very strong in the U.S., is very strong in Europe, very strong in Asia. And so it's equally effective there.  Sometimes the mix of industries affects particular geography or particular market where one set of industries might not be doing as well and so it's a little tougher selling apartment. But again, overall, our [Indiscernible] crops are strong at all those markets, and it's more specific things like that that would have impacted it. And as I said that our mix of sales people, particularly in the GBS.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Silber: Thanks so much. Just a couple of follow-up questions. First, going back to the whole issue about labor supply, I'm just wondering what the Impact of these tight labor markets has been on wage inflation, both for the sales force and for your associates broadly without -- throughout the Company? Hi, Jeff. Good morning. With labor markets as you've identified, everyone has been dealing with -- yes, we've seen a little bit of wage inflation. It's totally within a manageable level as what we've basically seen. But there has been some wage inflation both from -- as we look at externally and also as we want to make sure that we are retaining our associates as well. But all within manageable levels at this point.\nGene Hall: What we found is the biggest issue is that we have a lot of associates and they are big pockets, where we didn't realize we might not a great couple of competitive. And now, we know we were competitive in those pockets. And so I think that's been the biggest source of, what you might call, wage inflation.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay. That's helpful. And then shifting over to Conferences, I know there's a lot of the issues in deciding whether to hold a conference remotely or hold it live. But I'm just curious and I know this may vary across your major conferences. How much lead time is needed if you decide to go -- you're going to hold it remote and then decided to go live. How quickly can you ramp that up?\nGene Hall: So if we were planning to be virtual, which in July takes a long time because you got to reserve venues. You have to sell exhibitors, things like that. It's easier to go the other way around, meaning, a plan for live and go virtual. Because you have all the pieces in place already. And so typically, like we, as you know, this year, we plan to go live for some of our conferences and then to conclude it, it was not either allowed or was not safe to do so. And so we didn't. But it's easier that way once you have an in-person conference, plans go virtual because you don't have to worry about the venue and things like that. If you have a reserve, those venues, trying to get them at the right time and then, etc., is pretty tough to do.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay. So we're talking months. I wouldn't say years but if you decide to do something for next year, you would have to start looking at it right now.\nGene Hall: So the -- yes, basically, it can take months -- it can take years because if you sort of those proper venues, get booked up literally a couple of years in advance. And so if you're trying to book, it's departure venue, trying to book at the last second can be very tough. So yes, the planning actually can take years.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay. Makes sense. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Gene, you talked about beefing up the recruiting efforts and making changes. I'm just curious, you guys were always good on that front. Just curious. What needs to change in the new, I guess hybrid world I suppose?\nGene Hall: Hey, Manav. Good question. One of the things in the Hybrid world we need to focus on, and we always focus on this to a degree, but we have to talk about it typically, which is our employee value proposition. And why should associate want to come work in Gartner? The talent market we compete in is a very, very competitive market. We're very attractive employer. We have to make sure that our candidates understand that and understand what's different in a virtual environment. It might have been when it was up to your office station environments. That's kind of the key change.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. And just curious on, you've done one I guess [Indiscernible] deal this year. That sounds like things are going well across the front, balance sheet is healthy. Just curious if M and E is something we should see higher up on the agenda or just more of the same?\nCraig Safian: Yeah. Good morning Manav. I'd say, again, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We're focused on returning capital to shareholders through our buyback programs, which you guys, you've seen, we've been very aggressive with over the course of this year and then also hunting out on strategic value enhancing tuck-in M&A. The priority -- 1 A and 1 B from a priority perspective, we continue to scour the market for assets that makes sense for us. We are an organic grower, we don't need to do M&A to support our medium-term objectives. And so we can be very, very, very disciplined on the M&A front. We'll remain very disciplined on that front.\nManav Patnaik: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Jefferies, your line is open.\nMario Cortellacci: Hi. This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for [Indiscernible]. First question is just around conversion rate and just could you help us maybe think about how we should think about the conversion rate and research business from those in-person conferences versus virtual. As you get more back to the in-person conferences, should we expect a larger uplift in that conversion and even better growth in research?\nGene Hall: Hey, Mario. Good morning. As you highlight, your Conferences are an important piece of overall portfolio, and really support our research business in a variety of ways. One of those is in getting prospects there and having that experience. Gartner. Gartner. Gartner inside. And then converting them. We also, obviously, have the benefit of engagement with existing clients and so there is positive benefit on retention as well. When we did pivot to virtual, we were very focused on making sure that we maintain those levels of engagement both in terms of engaging and existing seat holders to,\nCraig Safian: to help with retention rates and also getting lots of prospects. Through so, we've been very focused on the fourth quarter of last year when we really ran our virtual conference portfolio and RS. And we did really good job on both fronts. And we're seeing the benefit of that from a retention rate perspective. This year it's certainly helping and it's also a big contributing nicely to our overall new business growth rates on research as well.  And as we roll forward, Gene talked about it in this sort of hybrid world of running in-person where we can and where it is safe to do so. We're going to take advantage of that from a research perspective. And when we run virtual, we intend to make sure we get the benefits of that on the research side as well. Whatever format we run in, it's a great business but it's, it's really an extension of our research business and that's why we will continue to run it, whether it's in-person or virtual.\nMario Cortellacci: Got it. And then in terms of consulting, can you just talk about what practices are faring better than others? And maybe you can update us on which verticals or adjacencies that you may be underpenetrated in?\nCraig Safian: Yes, Mario. On the consulting side, we've continued to have irrelatively strong performance there. We're seeing obviously a lot of work with are the major trends in technology, digital transformation, Cloud optimization, cybersecurity, things of those nature, those are really the big ones for us. As you know, we tend to focus our Consulting business on our largest, most complex clients.  And they have those issues in earnest that do -- a lot of our other sized clients as well. But we've seen really good performance for all the -- geographically and spread nicely across those couple of areas. And I would throw in strategic sourcing and cost optimization and into that Consulting mix as well. That is a strong practice for us.\nMario Cortellacci: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Gene Hall for closing remarks.\nGene Hall: As you've heard us say in this call, we once again delivered strong performances in Q3. And we performed well across all three of our businesses, research, consulting, and conferences. Delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. And we repurchased another $355 million of stock in the quarter. We continued to get better, faster, and strong as a Company. Gartner is a great place for associates. We provide outstanding returns for our shareholders and we're thriving in the current environment. Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene. And good morning. Third quarter results were again excellent with acceleration in contract value growth and strength in revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q3 performance. Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion of 16% year-over-year as reported, and 15% FX-neutral.  In addition, total contribution margin was 69% up more than 200 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $305 million up 82% year-over-year and up 80% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.03 and free cash flow in the quarter was $331 million. Research revenue in the third quarter grew 16% year-over-year as reported and 15% on an FX-neutral basis. We drove both strong retention and new business in the quarter. Third-quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, up over 200 basis points versus 2020. Higher-than-normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses, and lower than planned headcount. Total contract value grew 14% FX-neutral year-over-year to $4 billion at September 30th. Quarterly Net Contract Value Increase or NCVI was a very strong $146 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric.  Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, up almost 12% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $102 million from the second quarter. CV growth was led by the technology, manufacturing, and retail industries. While retention for GTS was 104% for the quarter, up 490 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business was up 25% versus last year with strong growth in new logos and expansion with existing client enterprises. GTS quota-bearing headcount increased from the second quarter.  We are beginning to see the positive effects of our investments to ramp up recruiting capacity. We continue to be successful recruiting new salespeople. Turnover among GTS front-line sellers is stable at the modestly elevated range we saw in the second quarter. With increased recruiting capacity and stable turnover, we expect to see continued expansion of the GTS sales team in Q4 and into 2022 and beyond. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global business sales contract value was $814 million at the end of the third quarter, up 22% year-over-year, which is above the high-end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $43 million from the second quarter. Broad-based CV growth included particular strength in the healthcare, technology and services industries.  All of our GBS practices achieved double-digit growth rates with the majority growing more than 20% year-over-year. Growth in the third quarter was led by the supply chain, HR, and sales practices. While retention for GBS was 113% for the quarter, up more than 14% points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 38% compared to last year, reflecting strong growth across the full portfolio. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased sequentially and is up 8% year-over-year. As with GTS, our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the third quarter was $24 million with reported growth of 92% and 93% FX-neutral. Contribution margin in the quarter was 47%. We held 8 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual and the meetings. We were able to reintroduce in-person event and meetings in the quarter and plan to ramp those up in Q4. Attendance is up significantly year-over-year as we've launched more virtual conferences to cover additional roles. Third quarter consulting revenues increased by 6% year-over-year to $95 million, on an FX-neutral basis, revenues were also up 6%. Consulting contribution margin was 33% in third quarter, up more than 110 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. Labor-based revenues were $78 million, up 5% versus Q3 of last year, and up 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 749 was up 2%, utilization was 62% up more than 130 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at September 30th was $126 million, increasing 27% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter.  Our contract optimization business was up 13% on a reported basis versus the prior-year quarter and up 12% FX-neutral. As we've detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly valuable. Consolidated cost of services increased 9% year-over-year and 8% FX-neutral in the third quarter. SG&A decreased 2% year-over-year and 3% FX during the third quarter. The year-over-year decline is largely related to the timing of certain prior-year expenses.  We expect SG&A expenses to increase over time as our hiring across the business continues to ramp. Total operating expenses were lower than planned because conferences continued to be virtual. We are resuming business travel and reopening offices at a very deliberate pace. And we're still ramping up or net growth hiring to our target levels. EBITDA for the third quarter was $305 million, up 82% year-over-year on a reported basis, and up 80% FX-neutral. Third quarter EBITDA again, reflected revenue above the high-end and cost towards the low-end of our expectations. Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, reflecting real estate and software which went into service since the third quarter of last year. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $30 million, up slightly versus the third quarter of 2020 due to an increase in total debt balances.  The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25.2% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust that income was 25.4% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.03. Weighted average fully diluted share count for the 3rd quarter was 84.8 million shares. We exited the quarter with 84.2 million fully diluted shares. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $345 million up 41% compared to last year. Cash flow strength continues to be driven by EBITDA growth and improved collections. Capex for the quarter was $14 million down 5% year-over-year. Lower capex is largely a function of lower real estate investments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $331 million.  Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest capital expense through needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 25% on a rolling four-quarter basis, adjusted for the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter. Free cash flow was well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. At the end of the third quarter, we had $766 million of cash. Our September 30th debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2 times. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy, of share of repurchases, and strategic tuck-in M&A.  Through the end of October, we have repurchased more than $1.6 billion in stock this year, including $355 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased over 7 million shares, reducing our net share count by around 7%. As of November 1st, we have around $600 million remaining on our repurchase authorization, which we expect the board will refresh as needed. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are updating our full-year guidance to reflect Q3 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. For revenue guidance, we now expect Research revenue of at least $4.07 billion, which is growth of 13%. We now expect Conferences revenue of at least $190 million, which is growth of 58%. We still expect Consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of 6%.  The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.66 billion, which is growth of 14%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX -benefit of about 190 basis points. This reflects modest headwinds from FX in the fourth quarter. For expenses we are investing in expanding our recruiting capacity to drive additional hiring across the entire business, including our sales teams. The additional hiring will continue into 2022 and beyond to support current and future growth. We plan to exit the year with quota-bearing headcount about flat for GTS. We expect low double-digit growth for GBS by the end of 2021.  Additionally, we continue to invest in a number of programs with a focus on improving sales productivity and cost effectiveness. We're also incurring some conference cancellation fees in the fourth quarter and during the process of reopening dozens of offices as well. We now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1.6 billion, which is an increase of about 54% versus 2020 and reflects reported margins of 27%.  Consistent with our comments last quarter, we estimate that normalized 2021 margins would be around 19%, if this had been a more typical year. About 2/3 of the adjustments are headcount related with most of the rest from travel and real estate. We expect our full-year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $113 million. Looking out to 2022 as the balance sheet stands today, we expect interest expense to be around $115 million.  We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $8.54. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.2 to $5 billion. This includes the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter this year. All the details of our full-year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. We had a strong 3rd quarter with momentum across the business. Contract value growth accelerated, and we had very strong revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow in the quarter. We've put our capital to work, repurchasing more than $1.6 billion worth of our stock this year through the end of October. And we've updated our guidance to reflect continuing strength and momentum in the business. Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged.  With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales cost growing in line with CV growth over time, and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest capex needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time and strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the Operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Good morning, Jeff. I think there's a couple of ways to look at what's happening under the covers. I think number 1, seeing the pickup in world attention is certainly a very positive trend which we anticipated. And as we've looked at the amount of up sell and expansion that we're driving within existing client enterprises, we're back to normal levels. While our retention is strongest, not quite back to historical levels, but we feel really good about the level of expansion we're driving within existing enterprises.  Again, some of that is when back, some of that is organic growth activities within existing enterprises. But while it is pretty strong, I think on the enterprise account, enterprise growth, we've seen now few quarters, enterprises expanding. And as you'd expect, when a new enterprise comes in, it comes in at a lower CV level than our overall average. And so the net enterprise adds that we've been doing will suppress a little bit or mute a little bit the CV for Enterprise that you see. And what you are seeing actually is both levers working really well for the last several quarters, particularly in the third quarter, with that expansion, with the existing enterprises showing up in a low retention number and the number of enterprises growing nicely as well. The other thing I know carriers in that net productivity number you're seeing it's as you called out. Really strong new business growth, but we've also seen meaningful improvements in the retention rates. And that obviously flows through to the NCVI per quota-bearing head as well. So it underscores [Indiscernible] points around the value proposition being super strong. So not only are we getting lots of shots on goal, as you say across the franchises, we're going those levels. I guess if I said the metaphor and keeping those seat holders in the franchise with stronger retention rates. Good morning, Toni. It's Craig. I think across all the GBS practices, as we mentioned, all of them are at double-digit growth rates on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter and more than half of them are north of 20% year-over-year growth. So we highlighted the top 3 which are performing really strongly, but that's not -- those aren't the only ones that are even north of 20% and again, to underscore the point, all of them are at double-digit growth rates. I think what we're seeing, and you can see this through a combination of metrics is we are selling a lot of new functions within existing enterprises.  Which is why you've seen a wild retention rate move up as nicely as it has. And so just because the client is purchasing supply chain subscription, selling into their finance team or their HR team with our legal team is a brand new sale for us. And we're doing really, really well there and in addition to you bringing on brand new enterprises into the GBS franchise as well. It's a combination of those two factors really driving that GBS growth. On cyclical versus secular. I think I go back to James' points earlier. We have a really, really strong value proposition in each of these functional areas that we are selling into. We've invested a lot over the last several years to make sure that we've got the right content and the right analysts and advisors, and the right service capacity in the right selling capacity. And so we feel good about each of these opportunities. Again, if you scan back, I mean these are enormous market opportunities for us and we're in the really, really, really innings on going after that market opportunity. I think that's a great question. A couple ways to think about it. So one, the biggest bucket by far is headcount related. And as we talked about, we are making progress there. We've increased recruiting capacity as Gene talked about, we're growing both sales forces now sequentially and we intend to do that not only with sales, but across the rest of the Company as needed as well. That is by far the biggest piece of it I think as I mentioned. I've prepared remarks about two-thirds of the quote and quote normalizing adjustments relate to headcount.  On the travel front, we are still almost at zero. And so there is still a long way to bounce back from that. When we were sitting here in May, we thought, second half of the year, it would start to bounce back. When we were sitting here in August, we saw in the fourth quarter, it would bounce back. It is reopening a little bit, but we are still at a tiny fraction of where we were historically. And as we roll into 2022, we do think it will rebound to reset at a new normal level. Will that be all the way back to 2019? Perhaps not. Perhaps there are things we can do a little more efficiently and effectively, but it's still going to be a pretty significant step-up from what we spent in 2021, which is virtually nothing, back to a new normal level in 2022. Yeah. Good morning Manav. I'd say, again, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We're focused on returning capital to shareholders through our buyback programs, which you guys, you've seen, we've been very aggressive with over the course of this year and then also hunting out on strategic value enhancing tuck-in M&A. The priority -- 1 A and 1 B from a priority perspective, we continue to scour the market for assets that makes sense for us. We are an organic grower, we don't need to do M&A to support our medium-term objectives. And so we can be very, very, very disciplined on the M&A front. We'll remain very disciplined on that front. to help with retention rates and also getting lots of prospects. Through so, we've been very focused on the fourth quarter of last year when we really ran our virtual conference portfolio and RS. And we did really good job on both fronts. And we're seeing the benefit of that from a retention rate perspective. This year it's certainly helping and it's also a big contributing nicely to our overall new business growth rates on research as well.  And as we roll forward, Gene talked about it in this sort of hybrid world of running in-person where we can and where it is safe to do so. We're going to take advantage of that from a research perspective. And when we run virtual, we intend to make sure we get the benefits of that on the research side as well. Whatever format we run in, it's a great business but it's, it's really an extension of our research business and that's why we will continue to run it, whether it's in-person or virtual. Yes, Mario. On the consulting side, we've continued to have irrelatively strong performance there. We're seeing obviously a lot of work with are the major trends in technology, digital transformation, Cloud optimization, cybersecurity, things of those nature, those are really the big ones for us. As you know, we tend to focus our Consulting business on our largest, most complex clients.  And they have those issues in earnest that do -- a lot of our other sized clients as well. But we've seen really good performance for all the -- geographically and spread nicely across those couple of areas. And I would throw in strategic sourcing and cost optimization and into that Consulting mix as well. That is a strong practice for us."

            "name": "Gene Hall",
            "content": "Good morning and thanks for joining us. Our growth increased again in the third quarter. We're performing well across the business. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. Total Company revenues were up 15% in Q3 with continued momentum across all three of our business segments. We also repurchased another $355 million in stock in the quarter. Bringing our year-to-date total through October to $1.6 billion and we're thriving in the current environment. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our research segment provides actionable, objective insight to executives and their teams. Reserve leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes, and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever. Everywhere around the world, our clients are facing more issues than ever before.  Challenging issues, things like the future of work, cybersecurity, carbon footprint, digital business, diversity, equity inclusion, Cloud and more. Our research is closely aligned to our client's priorities. We recently launched a new sustainability resource center that provides clients and prospects with actual insights on sustainable business strategy. Total research contract value growth increased to 14% with acceleration in both GTS and GBS driven by strong execution in both retention and new business. Global Technology Sales or GTS, returned to double-digit growth. GTS contract value growth accelerated to 12%. We expect GTS to deliver long-term, sustained double-digit contract value growth. Global Business Sales or GBS, delivered another outstanding quarter with contract value growth of 22%. All practices across GBS drove double-digit contract value growth. Across our entire research business, we're driving consistent execution of proven practices. And we continue to see the results of our efforts. Our conferences business also continues to deliver excellent performance. In 2020, we developed an entirely new conferences business model. This model leverages virtual conferences to deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to our audiences. We delivered a strong performance in conferences.  For the third quarter of 2021, conferences revenues were $24 billion. Total attendee numbers were up in Q3, as we are increasing our reach through our valuable content. There's a large constituency of our clients and prospects who prefer in-person conferences.  We've recently held some in-person event in advance which were very well received. As conditions continue to stabilize, we are operationally prepared to return to in-person conferences where and when we can. We'll continue to leverage our profitable virtual conferences as appropriate. Carter Consulting is an extension of Gartner research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business.  Consulting revenues grew 6% in Q3. So overall, we're performing really well as a Company. We're thriving in our current environments. We're able to serve our clients and sell the prospects very effectively in a virtual environment. Most of our associates appreciate working virtually. They would like some in-person interactions with their colleagues when that's the best way to engage with each other and get work done. We've created an operating model that supports virtual and in-person interactions. And these gives our associates flexibility, while promoting activities to drive associate engagement. We've also ramped up our recruiting function to support long-term sustained double-digit growth. We're seeing great success in hiring during one of the toughest labor markets ever. Finally, we're taking steps to make the associate experience at Gartner even better.  We're a growth Company. We're focused on ensuring our associates have clear and compelling career paths. We're helping our managers and leaders have powerful career development conversations with their teams. We continue to improve on our proven practices and we're innovating processes and technology to streamline operations. In closing, Gartner delivered another strong performance in Q3. We're performing well across all 3 of our business segments. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. And we repurchased another $355 million of stock in the quarter. We continue to get better, faster, stronger as a Company. Gartner is a great place to be for our associates. We deliver extraordinary value to our current clients. We provide outstanding returns for our shareholders. And we're thriving in the current environment. With that, I will hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Craig? Hey, Jeff. Gene. So first, the -- we do have a lot of headcounts and 1 of the leverage that we used for growth, but it's not the only lever. We also early are very focused on productivity and we believe there's quite a bit of room for productivity improvements going forward. In parallel with that, as I mentioned on the call and Craig did as well. We have initiatives underway to ramp up our recruiting capacity and output and refining actually we have a great value proposition, is very attractive markets. And so we're quite optimistic about our ability to ramp up hiring as we need to leverage productivity anytime. Hey, Gary. A couple of things going on with GTS headcount. First, it is a highly competitive labor market and sort of the turnover is up modestly. And of course they're within the modestly higher turnover. Their pockets are hired to modest turnover, but overall it's modestly up. And we recognize that and we have a number of programs in place which we think will actually address that. We have a very good -- and we have a very strong employee value proposition. In fact, we don't have any trouble recruiting people into the Company.  And so the combination of continuing to strengthen our employee value proposition, we believe will get churn of this modest, high turnover back to normal levels in an [Indiscernible] that we are rapidly ramping up are recruiting capacity as I mentioned. We had just started ramping up recruiting capacity back in May, but obviously what happens is you start -- you've got to hire recruiters. It takes a while to actually get them on the job, and then just like any other job, it takes recruiters some time to get up to full capacity.  And so when we started ramping up recruiting capacity back in May, it takes a little time before that definitely kicks in. As Craig mentioned on the script, on his prepared remarks. We're already seeing that we're back to kind of the levels of hiring that we were back in 2019. Again, we expect that to continue to go up. So we expect a combination of improved employee turnover from the programs we have in place, combined with higher recruiting capacity to really address this issue. In GTS, like GBS have a great value proposition. We provide actual insights to our clients on their toughest issues. So we start -- I think what we start with is we have a really great high proposition. As we talked about, we invested in making sure we had the content, sales training, a number of experts, etc. over the last really 2 or 3 years to make sure that we had all the pieces in place to have to be able deliver that incredible value proposition. And now we're seeing the benefits of that. We're going to continue to keep investing in those areas and so I'd expect our value proposition which is very strong. And also get our ability to execute on sales will continue to be very strong as well. Good morning, George. Productivity, it is an [Indiscernible] measure and so we're trying to even out or take out seasonality from the measure. There are some structural differences that we've talked about in the past -- in looking at GBS compared to GTS. And again, based on where we are in the journey on these two businesses. And so on GBS side, because we are, as I mentioned earlier in the really early innings of going after this really enormous market opportunity. We have a racer mix of what we call business developers or hunters whose sole job is to go out and find new business. And they're performing really, really well, and have been.  And we've been building to that. It wasn't just a 1 quarter phenomenon, let's say, several quarter multi-year phenomenon that we've been experiencing there. And so again, they are performing really well, the retention levels are helping a lot on the types of quota-bearing hires or AEs that managed CV and drive growth through expansion. So it's really a combination of those 2 things. As we look at the future, is this the right level to think about?  We will see, I mean, there is -- we do believe there was a little bit of pent-up demand out there in the market coming through the pandemic last year. But we feel like we're in a really good place with GBS achieving strong growth rates. And again, through a combination of really strong new business and improving retention rates as well. Yes, George, it's actually a combination of improved spread revenue outlook and performance and some improved cost profiles as well, is really driving both the modest adjustment from 18% to 19% to where we are now which is around 19%. But I guess, generally, the way to think about a normalized margin of around 19% is, it is how our P&L would look at a more typical year with sales headcount growing a few points lower than CV, offices opened for the full year, normal travel levels as we just discussed on Toni question, and growth investment to support all the growth that we're driving across the business. And so a modest change. But again, I'd say a combination of the revenue performing a little bit better than expected as we've talked about each quarter. And some tightening or more efficiency on the cost side as well. Hey, Andrew, great question. Conferences are important part of our business. And we have -- with the pandemic, developed quite good virtual conferences that have a lot of value to our clients and our [Indiscernible] received. Having said that, a lot of our clients want to, in particular, used to go to in-person conference, as we do our customer research, there is strong interest and desire for us to provide them with in-person conferences as well. So the look of future, right now, the way we are thinking is we would -- whether it is safe to do so that allowed in each geographic area range for environment.  We will -- we plan to hold in-person conferences because it does provide tremendous value to our clients. And having said that, we also plan to continue with virtual conferences for those clients that either don't want to travel or can't travel, given when we have our in-person conferences. And so our long-term strategy, our long-term plan is to have a mix of both in-person conferences and virtual conferences. Going back to kind of the great success we had with the in-person ones combined with what we learned in the pandemic for the virtual conferences. You know Andrew, it's hard to say now. Just we've been operating a little bit in between the 2 models as we've -- as you know we were preparing to run a portion of our conferences this year in-person. And so we add staff onboard to be able to do that. And then obviously, we had to cancel those in-person conferences in the fourth quarter and relaunched our virtual -- And so again, I think the way we think about it is, the contribution margin will look similar to the way it looked pre -pandemic for the overall conferences business.  I do think and again, we'll provide guidance on 25 in February. We're working through our operational plans now. But we -- and again, we've talked about this in the past, we are not going to be in a position to relaunch the 70 inverse definition conferences that we had in 2019, run them at the exact same profile economic and otherwise in 2022 it's going to takes some time to build back into those. And so again, as we think about it, the combined operating margin for conferences looks pretty similar to the way it looks a lot prior to the pandemic, as it stands right now. So let me start on that, Andrew. So the first thing is GBS is largely weighted to the U.S. And so most of the GBS growth just because of it is much less mature outside U.S., even in the U.S., it's going to be we're heavily U.S. weighted. It's going well outside the U.S. as well but it's just a share of business, our share of salespeople are overwhelming U.S. Over time, just as we've done GTS, we expect to have our international markets and GBS be just strongly staff as we have GTS today. As we keep debt and salespeople over time. And so that's one of the factors to drives the U.S. markets. In terms of actual our value proposition is very strong in the U.S., is very strong in Europe, very strong in Asia. And so it's equally effective there.  Sometimes the mix of industries affects particular geography or particular market where one set of industries might not be doing as well and so it's a little tougher selling apartment. But again, overall, our [Indiscernible] crops are strong at all those markets, and it's more specific things like that that would have impacted it. And as I said that our mix of sales people, particularly in the GBS. What we found is the biggest issue is that we have a lot of associates and they are big pockets, where we didn't realize we might not a great couple of competitive. And now, we know we were competitive in those pockets. And so I think that's been the biggest source of, what you might call, wage inflation. So if we were planning to be virtual, which in July takes a long time because you got to reserve venues. You have to sell exhibitors, things like that. It's easier to go the other way around, meaning, a plan for live and go virtual. Because you have all the pieces in place already. And so typically, like we, as you know, this year, we plan to go live for some of our conferences and then to conclude it, it was not either allowed or was not safe to do so. And so we didn't. But it's easier that way once you have an in-person conference, plans go virtual because you don't have to worry about the venue and things like that. If you have a reserve, those venues, trying to get them at the right time and then, etc., is pretty tough to do. So the -- yes, basically, it can take months -- it can take years because if you sort of those proper venues, get booked up literally a couple of years in advance. And so if you're trying to book, it's departure venue, trying to book at the last second can be very tough. So yes, the planning actually can take years. Hey, Manav. Good question. One of the things in the Hybrid world we need to focus on, and we always focus on this to a degree, but we have to talk about it typically, which is our employee value proposition. And why should associate want to come work in Gartner? The talent market we compete in is a very, very competitive market. We're very attractive employer. We have to make sure that our candidates understand that and understand what's different in a virtual environment. It might have been when it was up to your office station environments. That's kind of the key change. Hey, Mario. Good morning. As you highlight, your Conferences are an important piece of overall portfolio, and really support our research business in a variety of ways. One of those is in getting prospects there and having that experience. Gartner. Gartner. Gartner inside. And then converting them. We also, obviously, have the benefit of engagement with existing clients and so there is positive benefit on retention as well. When we did pivot to virtual, we were very focused on making sure that we maintain those levels of engagement both in terms of engaging and existing seat holders to, As you've heard us say in this call, we once again delivered strong performances in Q3. And we performed well across all three of our businesses, research, consulting, and conferences. Delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. And we repurchased another $355 million of stock in the quarter. We continued to get better, faster, and strong as a Company. Gartner is a great place for associates. We provide outstanding returns for our shareholders and we're thriving in the current environment. Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nGene Hall: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Gartner's positive momentum continued in the second quarter of 2021. We again delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We significantly increased the pace of our buybacks.  Total company revenues were up 16% with strength in all three business segments and research exceeding our expectations. We continue to see growth opportunities across industries, geographies, and every size enterprise. Research is our largest and most profitable segment. Our research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is fast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. Total contract value growth increased to 11% with both GTS and GBS accelerating in the quarter. This was driven by strength in both retention and new business. Global Technology Sales or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. For Q2, GTS contract value growth accelerated to 9% and we have CD growth in all of our top 10 countries. GTS drove strong growth across virtually all industries, including manufacturing, services, and tech and telecom. And we expect GTS contract value growth to continue accelerating, returning to double-digit growth in the future. Global business sales or GPS serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS again accelerated, delivering outstanding contract value growth of 18%. Both practices contributed to our growth. And our HR, finance, sales and supply chain practices each exceeded 20% contract value growth. So across our entire research business, we're seeing the results of a sustained focus, a consistent execution of proven practices. We continued to have a vast market opportunity. And our research business is well-positioned as we continue to deliver long-term sustained double-digit growth. Turning to conferences. For the second quarter of 2021, conferences revenues were $58 million, again exceeding our expectations. As many of you know, during 2020 we were unable to hold in-person conferences. To address this situation we created virtual conferences to deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to our audiences. We continue to operationally prepare for some in-person conferences in the second half of the year if conditions allow. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project based work. Consulting revenues were up 4% in Q2. We had strength in our labor-based business. With labor-based revenue up 20% over this time last year. Contract optimization revenue was down from a record high last year. Overall, Consulting continues to be an important complement to our IT research business. To ensure we keep pace with our accelerating growth rates, we're rapidly growing our recruiting capacity. Our hiring is accelerating. Even in today's tough labor market, candidates see Gartner as a great place for a long-term career. They know we have an incredible impact on our clients, that we're a sales-driven growth company and our growth provides among the best promotion and professional development opportunities for all our associates. With strong revenues and continued disciplined cost management, EBITDA exceeded expectations. Strong EBITDA combined with effective cash management resulted in strong free cash flow. Our priorities for cash flow continue to be strategic, tuck-in acquisitions, like the small one we did this quarter and share repurchases. Summarizing, Q2 was another strong quarter with strength in all three business segments, and research exceeding our expectations. We delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Looking ahead, we're well-positioned for long-term sustained double-digit growth. We have a vast addressable market. We have an attractive recurring revenue business model with strong contribution margins. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which will continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. With that, I'll hand the call over to Craig. Craig?\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter results were excellent with strength in contract value growth, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q2 performance. Second quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up 20% year-over-year as reported and 16% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up more than 300 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $355 million, up 85% year-over-year and up 75% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.24. Free cash flow on the quarter was $563 million. Free cash flow includes $150 million from insurance proceeds related to cancelled 2020 conferences. Research revenue in the second quarter grew 15% year-over-year as reported and 11% on an FX neutral basis. We saw strong retention and new business in the quarter. Second quarter research contribution margin was 74%, up about 170 basis points versus 2020. Contribution margins reflect both improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses and lower than planned headcount. However, some of the margin improvement compared to historical levels is temporary and will reverse as we resume normal travel and increased spending to support growth. Total contract value grew 11% FX neutral year-over-year to $3.8 billion at June 30. Quarterly net contract value increased or NCVI was $114 million, significantly better than the pandemic lows in the second quarter of last year and a new record high for second quarter NCVI. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. Global technology sales contract value at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion, up 9% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $75 million from the first quarter. The selling environment continued to improve in the second quarter. By industry, CV growth was led by technology, manufacturing and services. While retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, up about 110 basis points year-over-year. While retention isn't yet fully back to normal because it's a rolling four quarter measure. GTS new business was up 38% versus last year with strength in new logos and continued improvement in upsell with existing clients. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales Contract Value was $770 million at the end of the second quarter, up 18% year-over-year, which is above the high-end of our medium term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $39 million from the first quarter. Broad-based CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. All of our practices including marketing delivered year-over-year and sequential CV growth. HR, finance, sales and supply chain each grew 20% or more year-over-year. While retention for GBS was 110% for the quarter, up more than 950 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 76% over last year, led by very strong growth across the full portfolio. As with GTS our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $58 million compared to no revenue in the year-ago quarter. Contribution margin in the quarter was 73% driven by strong top line performance. We held 13 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Avanta meetings. Second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 9% year-over-year to $106 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 4%. Consulting contribution margin was 40% in the second quarter, up almost 600 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Labor-based revenues were $86 million, up 25% versus Q2 of last year and up 20% on an FX neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 740 was down 7%. Utilization was 70%, up more than 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at June 30 was $108 million, up 7% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter. Our Contract Optimization business was down 31% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and down 33% FX neutral. The prior year period was the highest ever revenue quarter for Contract Optimization and as we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. Consolidated cost of service has increased 9% year-over-year and 6% FX neutral in the second quarter. Cost of services increased due to the reinstatement of annual merit increases and to support growth in the business. SG&A decreased 1% year-over-year and 4% FX neutral in the second quarter. Compared with the prior year period, SG&A declined due to lower severance and conference related expenses partially offset by higher personnel costs. E&E remains close to zero. Operating expenses were lower than planned in part because net headcount growth was below our targets. While our rate of hiring continues to ramp up, turnover remains modestly above normal levels due to tighter labor market conditions. As Gene said, we're rapidly growing our recruiting capacity to keep pace with our accelerating growth rates. EBITDA for the second quarter was $355 million, up 85% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 75% FX neutral. Second quarter EBITDA again reflected revenue above the high-end and cost towards the low-end of our expectations. Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, reflecting real estate and software which went into service since the second quarter of last year. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $26 million, roughly flat versus the second quarter of 2020. The Q2 adjusted tax rate which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 29.9% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 24.6% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $2.24. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the second quarter was 86.6 million shares. We exited the second quarter with 85.1 million fully diluted shares. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $575 million, up 68% compared to last year. Q2 operating cash flow includes $150 million of proceeds from insurance related to 2020 conference cancellations. Excluding the insurance proceeds, operating cash flow improved by 24% versus the prior year quarter. Cash flow strength continues to be driven by EBITDA growth and improved collections. CapEx for the quarter was $12 million, down 44% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $563 million, which was up about 75% versus the prior year. Excluding the insurance proceeds, free cash flow improved by 28% versus the prior year quarter. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 27% on a rolling four quarter basis. Excluding the insurance proceeds, free cash flow was 23% of revenue, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow was well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. At the end of the second quarter, we had $796 million of cash. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of new 8-year senior unsecured notes with a 3.625% coupon. We used the proceeds from this new issuance to repay $100 million of the existing term loan A. The balance is available for general corporate purposes including share repurchases. Our June 30 debt balance was $2.5 billion. At the end of the second quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2.3x. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity and cash to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. During the quarter, we made a small acquisition with net cash paid at closing of $23 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased more than $1 billion in stock, including $685 million during the second quarter. In July, the Board increased our share repurchase authorization for the third time this year, adding another $800 million. As of August 1, we have more than $1 billion available for share repurchases. We expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share, and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q2 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. For Research, the strong start to the year in CV performance and improvement to non-subscription revenue are contributing to higher than previously expected research revenue. For Conferences, our guidance is still based on being virtual for the full year. With the uptick in COVID and shifting government directives, there is much more uncertainty around our ability to run in-person conferences during the balance of the year. We continue to operationally plan for some in-person conferences. Our updated guidance reflects some additional cancellation related costs for conferences where we have been planning to run in-person, but may need to cancel. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. For expenses, we have reinstated benefits which were either cancelled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase, which took effect April 1. We are investing in expanding our recruiting capacity, drive additional hiring across the business. The additional hiring will continue into 2022 and beyond to support current and future growth. Our current plan is to increase quota-bearing headcount in the mid single digits for GTS and low double digits for GBS by the end of 2021. Additionally, we continue to invest in a number of programs with a focus on improving sales productivity. As you know, travel expenses were close to zero from April 2020 through June 2021. Our current plans continue to assume a ramp up in travel related expenses. Over the course of the rest of this year, we add more to the fourth quarter. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings. For our revenue guidance, we now expect research revenue of at least $4 billion, which is growth of 11%. We still expect Conferences revenue of at least $170 million, which is growth of 41%. We still expect Consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of 6%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.57 billion, which is growth of 11%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. The year-over-year FX benefit was more pronounced in the first half of the year. With the ongoing business momentum, we are seeing we will continue to restore growth spending as we move through the year. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1.16 billion, which is an increase of about 42% versus 2020 and reflects reported margins of 25.4%. We expect a reasonable baseline for thinking about the margins going forward is around 18% to 19% consistent with our comments last quarter. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $113 million. Looking out to 2022, as the balance sheet stands today, we expect interest expense to be around $115 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $7.60. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.13 billion. This includes the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter this year. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Turning to the second half of the year. For Research, we have more visibility into revenue the farther we get into the year. This is because NCVI earlier in the year has more of an effect on the full year revenue. Seasonally, Conferences and Consulting are also both typically later in Q3. Finally, at the start of 2021, there was a lot of uncertainty in the world and we began with a prudently conservative plan. More than halfway through the year and with less macro uncertainty, there's a lower likelihood of the kind of upside we've seen in the past few quarters. As a result, we expect reported numbers to be closer to our guidance than earlier in the year. Any upside is more likely to come from lower costs than higher revenue. For Q3, we expect to deliver at least $250 million of EBITDA. We also expect the tax rate for the quarter in the high 20s. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales cost growing in line with CV growth over time, and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 18% to 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us up front. We will repurchase shares over time, which will lower the share count. With a strong first half, with momentum across the business, we have meaningfully updated our outlook for 2021 to reflect the stronger demand environment and our enhanced visibility. We are restoring certain expenses and investing to ensure we are well-positioned to continue our momentum. We repurchased more than $1 billion worth of stock this year, and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gary Bisbee with BofA Securities. Your line is open.\nGary Bisbee: Hey, guys, good morning and congratulations on another strong results. I guess, I wanted to dig a little more into the cost. The trend all year has been revenue ahead of your plan and costs a bit below or at the low-end. What's really keeping you from accelerating investment? Is it the inability to hire, you talked about that investing there that being a little more difficult, is it in part that you don't need more sales to deliver to the target this year, given how strong productivity has been? Or are there other factors I guess, maybe particularly I'm interested in labor market tightness, and sort of how long you think it will take to get the hiring that you've been targeting on? Thank you.\nGene Hall: Hey, Gary, it's Gene. So we came into this year with a lot of sales capacity that we've built up over 2019. And so to your point -- you mentioned in your question, we actually have a lot of sales capacity, you're seeing that in our sales results. And so the reason we've been relatively slow to ramp up our sales hiring, our net sales hiring has been we felt like we had plenty of capacity and plenty of opportunity and productivity and we still do. Having said that, as I mentioned earlier in my results, we're now at the point we think it's time to start ramping up that capacity. And so we've been aggressively building our recruiting capability, building our pipeline of candidates and we'd expect to increase that hiring as we go through the year to position us very well for next year and beyond.\nCraig Safian: And, Gary, the other thing I would just add, good morning, is as the world has started to reopen, we've had fits and starts with that as well. And so we did have plans to have more travel. And that hasn't panned out given that the situation in the world. We had plans to reopen facilities, a lot of those have just been pushed back further into the year as well. So it's really a combination on the headcount side that Gene just highlighted as well as some other large expense buckets that have just continued to be pushed out into the back half of the year.\nGary Bisbee: Okay. And then just on that note, the quick follow-up, the 18% to 19% medium term margin target, if I backed into it, right, it appears like the second half is above that. Whereas last quarter, you were talking about it moving down to that level. Is that just delays in some of these costs, like travel coming back that you just cited? Or opening offices or is that inability to maybe hire as quickly as you want also part of what's going on there?\nCraig Safian: Yes, it's all three of those things, Gary, I would say. So, things getting pushed out further into the year, including the ramp up in hiring that Gene just talked about. So, let's pretend that we didn't hire all of our needs until December 1 that's obviously not going to happen. But low burden on the 2021 P&L, full year burden on the 2022 P&L. So our outlook in terms of margin for next year is really unchanged from last quarter. This year changed just because, again, we continue to push out certain expanses further and further into the back half of the year.\nGary Bisbee: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yes, thank you. I had noticed that GBS sales headcount has been back to sequential growth, GTS has not. I guess what I'm wondering is, is that a function of GBS metrics inflecting earlier and growth being stronger and therefore you kick the hiring into gear sooner there? Or is it more of a challenge in GTS because it's harder to retain individuals with tech domain selling experience? And if it's the latter, just any thoughts on if the comp packages are appropriate or need to be adjusted?\nGene Hall: Yes, hey, Jeff. So, the -- I'd say the biggest issue is where you -- the first you started with, which is with the faster growth in GBS, the rapid acceleration, we've got more of a need to get to -- our net hiring up sooner than we have with GTS. Having said that, as I mentioned in my remarks, turnover is modestly higher and it would be affect-- it affects the people that are in the parts of our business that are technology like our software [indiscernible] even as well as our GTS sales force. And while that's mostly higher, that's only a piece of it. I think it's greater pieces, just kind of my what I said in the earlier question about the timing of when we -- the capacity we have today and the time when we chose to have recruiting start back up again. We have -- we're a great place to work. Our salespeople know that and really love being here. And of course, we're a great place to attract new talents as well.\nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then not that I'd expect you to adjust your GBS medium term guidance, because you had one quarter above the range. But I guess how are you thinking about it? And is there some reason why there is like, cyclical lift in the current trends? Because I guess as I look at it, the growth sounds broad based, the comps aren't that easy. And the historical experience from GTS is on a organic constant currency basis that accelerated coming out of the financial crisis to a level and then it remained at that level kind of throughout the expansion. So just any thoughts on GBS and if there's, I guess, upside potential or why not.\nCraig Safian: Good morning, Jeff, and thanks for the question. I think in terms of the way we think about the business over the medium term unchanged. And so, again, we believe that over the medium term, we can grow both GTS and GBS in that 12% to 16% range. Obviously, GBS is performing exceptionally well. We've seen it accelerate, even last year the acceleration started, it has continued through the first half of the year. And this [indiscernible] has been a really nice combination of improvements in retention, which you can see in our key metrics as well as great new business growth across the board. So it's not any one practice. It's actually as you alluded to, broad based from industry perspective and from a practice perspective. And so, we remain bullish on GBS. We remain bullish on GTS as well. And over the medium term, again, we believe we can grow both in that 12% to 16% range.\nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. The sales force productivity or NCBI for GBS stepped up to 141,000, which came ahead of GTS for the first time ever. Can you elaborate on what drove the increase? And whether you expect GBS productivity to step back down to be below GPS levels over the near-term?\nGene Hall: Yes. hey, George. The thing that drives our productivity in both sales forces is we've heard before, which is our recruiting capability, the training portals we have, the tools we have in the process design. And so the thing that's driving productivity is, as the market has gotten, as the recession has come a little bit better, those combination of factors, the recruiting, training, tools and process affect both businesses. And that's what you're seeing what you're seeing drive the productivity improvement. And so over time, we expect both productivity improving in both sales forces.\nGeorge Tong: And just on the second part of the question, what drove GBS to come ahead of GTS for the first time? And when would you expect that productivity to flip over the near-term back to GBS being below GTS?\nGene Hall: We don't think about it as, one is going to be higher than the other. We expect both will actually have improvements over time. And there's one meaningful difference between GBS and GTS. And that is that we have a higher number of what we call business developers, which are sales people that don't have any existing accounts. GTS has a much larger installed base. And so we have a large number of what we call account executives, whose job is to sell more business to those existing clients. In GTS, we also have the business developers, but in GBS, we have a much higher number of business developers compared to account executives than we do at GTS. That's part of the thing that helps -- that impact sales productivity with GBS both now and over time.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, you've increased your EBITDA margins for the full year to 25.4% at the midpoint. What expectations respecting half margins? Are you embedding into your guidance? And how should 2022 margins compared with second half margins?\nGene Hall: Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. Obviously, the second half margins are lower than what we've run through the first half and what the full year implies. Yet, as Gary highlighted as well, it's a little bit higher than the 18% to 19% that we've guided, or at least preliminary -- preliminarily guided around how to think about a normalized margin for this year. And there's really one primary reason for that, and it's the deferral and the pushing out of spending that we expected to come in sooner, just happening a little bit later over the course of 2021, but I was assuming we bear the full burden of that as the business continues to accelerate into 2022. And so, a little bit higher than 80% to 90% is the expectation for the second half of the year. But again, that's largely because we've pushed out and deferred certain expenses to later in this year. But we'll have a full impact on the 2022 P&L.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you so much. I was hoping you could talk about what you're hearing from clients in terms of appetite for in-person conferences. I know you talked about you're operationally planning on running some of them later this year, and that would be upside to the guidance. But just what's the demand of that you're hearing from clients, and has the delta variant impacted that at all?\nGene Hall: Hey, Toni. Our in-person conferences remain usually popular with our clients. Clients are, I'd say, quite enthusiastic about returning to those in-person conferences and we're looking forward to it. As of -- as we sit here today, I'd say our registrations for the conferences in the U.S haven't been affected very much by the delta variant, that could change over time, if things goes on. But the sentiment, as of just right now, in terms of registrations things, hasn't changed very much. Outside of the U.S., I'd say there's more concern about it, and so it's not the same around the world. Having said that, either there's a concern about the delta variant, the kind of underlying demand there, even the clients that are concerned about the delta variant in terms of attending a conference, if we can address that are wildly enthusiastic about conferences and really want to return back to them. And so, over time, we'd expect when it's safe to do so to be introducing in-person conferences to meet that demand.\nToni Kaplan: That's great. And your free purchased more than a $1 billion of stock this year. Just any updates to capital allocation priorities and on strategic tuck-ins, I think you did a small one this quarter. So just give us a sense of what the optimal strategic tuck-in looks like right now at this point. Thanks.\nCraig Safian: Hey, good morning, Toni. I'll start out and then flip it over to Gene on the M&A strategy. You're right, we've repurchased over a $1 billion worth of our stock through the first half of this year. As we've always highlighted, we have two priorities from a capital allocation perspective. And they're not stacked to prioritize. It's 1A and 1B. I would characterize it as, which is returning capital to our shareholders, through buyback programs, and strategic value enhancing M&A, which is largely going to be in the small medium tuck-in size. As we look forward, those remain the two priorities, given what we see in the market. Clearly, in the first half of this year, we put a bias or a priority around returning capital through our buyback programs. But as we move forward, we have ample free cash flow, ample cash on balance sheet, ample balance sheet flexibility for it to be an end. So we can do buybacks and strategic tuck-in M&A as opposed to it being an overstatement. We just happened to put a strong bias towards buybacks through the first half of the year. And I'll flip it to Gene to talk about the M&A side.\nGene Hall: Yes, Toni, so over time, in general, our acquisitions have been focused on additions to our capabilities in one way or another. So sometimes they've been actual kind of acquisitions to get to talent. Other times it's been product extensions, which we've used. And so I think -- you can think about it as ways to improve our capabilities, either in a direct people sense or in a product offering sense.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning, I was hoping you could touch on the level of client engagement you've seen in the past quarter or two, and how that compares to pre-pandemic levels? If it's still elevated relative to two pre-COVID, and if so how important do you think that is to what I think is record client retention metrics you posted this quarter, just trying to get a sense for how much of this could be more of a temporary phenomenon, given the current environment?\nGene Hall: Andrew, client engagement is really important in our business, when they -- when clients buy our services, they do it to get value out of it. When they get the values, they engage with us. And so, client engagement is up substantially compared to 2019. It's about the same as it was in 2020. And that's partially as you said, due to the environment, there's a lot of uncertainty. But it's also due to the fact that we spend a lot of our energy, thinking of ways that we can actually stimulate an engagement because again, we know we get -- when we get more engagement, we -- our clients get more value out of our services. So it's kind of the two things are related.\nAndrew Nicholas: Got it. Makes sense. And then for my follow-up, several quarters in a row now have a pretty sizable upside in terms of your guidance, or at least relative to your at least, methodology. And so I'm just wondering given now that, that it seems to be a bit more stable of an operating environment than the past 12 to 18 months, it's if you're considering or how you're thinking about your approach to guidance, and whether you'll consider potentially reverting back to the more traditional bracketed approach at some point, whether it's later this year or early next. Thanks.\nGene Hall: Good morning, Andrew. Great question. We've actually shifted our guidance methodology to the at least pre-pandemic. And I don't see us slipping back. I think you guys, as you alluded to, obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty in the world. And we've been trying to since the beginning of the pandemic, plan thoughtfully, planned prudently. And even when we entered this year, I would say plan conservatively as well. As the world has stabilized and we've got a heck of a lot more visibility into how the business is performing. We are still comfortable with the guidance methodology that we have. That said, I'd reiterate what I said in my prepared remarks earlier around your expected variability. On that guidance moving forward, we would expect much less variability, probably more variability on the expense side than on the revenue side. But we are comfortable with the way that we guide now and the current methodology that we use.\nAndrew Nicholas: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Silber: Thank you so much. You noted in your prepared remarks about higher -- slightly higher than expected turnover from I believe it was your sales force. Where are these folks going? Are they going to competitors? Are they going out on their own going to other industries, any color would be great.\nGene Hall: Hey, Jeff. The -- as I mentioned, turnover across the business is modestly up. And the turnover is going to same places that it's always gone, which is the -- we are known as a company that has great recruiting, training programs. And so there's people like to recruit from us. We're trying to recruit from us. And there's one of the simplest that has gone, which tends to be the technology industry.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay, great. That's helpful. And you mentioned in your guidance that it includes your planning from some in-person destinations, but the guidance only -- on the conference side, excuse me, the guidance is the least since virtual for conference revenue can remind us what the delta would be just for us for modeling purposes, if you shift from virtual to in-person.\nGene Hall: Yes, Jeff, it's and part of the reason why we got it this way is, the difference will vary on a conference-by-conference basis. So it's very hard, or impossible to answer that question in terms of building your model. And I think the way to think about it is, with our current guide, it is virtual only. That is the best numbers to plug in right now. And as we said, if we are able to run some in-person conferences in the balance of the year, it would be upside to those numbers, but it will depend on the timing or location, and everything else and it will be done on a -- and decisions will be made on a conference-by-conference basis.\nJeffrey Silber: All right. If I could sneak in one quick one, I'm sorry. You mentioned that the guidance does include some additional cancellation related costs. Can you quantify those for us?\nGene Hall: Yes, sure. It's probably low double digits millions in terms of the potential cancellation costs. It's hard to quantify that right now. Some of them are contractual, some of them will be some [ph] costs that go into to the conference pre-cancellation decision, but it's in the low double-digit million is a current contemplation.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMario Cortellacci:  Hi, this Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Just kind of going back to the delta variant, wondering how you're thinking about that and considering opening your in-person conferences. Is your decision for the based more around government guidelines? Or is it just strictly more prudence on Gartner's part, and just making sure that events are safe? Or if there's no government restrictions, you guys, because you have the demand in place, you will feel more comfortable doing it?\nGene Hall: Yes, Mario. So as I mentioned, the starting point we have is that our clients, actually really appreciate the value of in-person conferences, and we'd like to get back to them. Having said that, what we're going to do and any -- before we hold in any in-person conference, we're certainly going to follow any government guidelines that are relevant. So where the CDC or the relevant agencies in other countries have said, you shouldn't have large gatherings in this sort of circumstance, even if it's not a regulation, we're going to follow those guidelines. And the third thing is we -- on a regular basis, survey our clients to see how they feel about it as well. And so, we want to reflect their center as well. Even if there were no government guidelines, but our client sentiment was, it's not a safe thing to do that we certainly wouldn't follow that as well. And, of course, we use finally our own assessment. And if we think even if the guidance, okay, and even if clients want to do it, we don't think it's safe. We wouldn't hold them as well. So it's kind of those are the factors that go into the decision making in terms of whether we hold in-person conference or not.\nMario Cortellacci: Got it. And then just for my follow-up, did you talk about when you're looking at a GTS sales force productivity, I guess, what are the biggest levers that you can pull to get back to pre-pandemic levels? You talked about, I guess, some of the levers for GBS being I guess, broad and that they're all contributing, but is there one bigger lever that you can pull in GTS. And then also, could you just compare what the 10-year is for the GTS sales force today versus pre-pandemic, and then how much of that 10-year can help add to productivity.\nGene Hall: Yes, so the first part it's the factors I missed earlier, which is the things that impact productivity are really our recruiting program, making sure we recruit the best people, making sure we bring them on board that they're trained to sell the Gartner kinds of products, equipped with great tools. And if we have the best processes, we're constantly improving those things. And so, over time, we expect those will drive productivity improvements. In terms of tenure compared to where we were in 2019, our tenures, on average, higher because we slowed hiring and so with fewer new -- a lower proportion of new people from our slowed hiring are the average tenure has gone up over time.\nCraig Safian: Anyway to help quantify or give us a sense for how much that can help contribute to productivity?\nGene Hall: Yes, I can't quantify it for you. I mean, again, we track the numbers, but we don't -- those aren't things we talked about publicly. And so the, I guess, I'll leave it at the 10 years higher.\nMario Cortellacci: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions, I could turn the call back over to Gene Hall for any closing remarks.\nGene Hall: Well, summarizing today's call, Q2 was another strong quarter. It was strengthened all three business segments, and research exceeding our expectations. We delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. GTS contract value growth accelerated to 9% and GBS contract value growth accelerated to 18%. We're accelerating hiring across our business to keep pace with this growth. Looking ahead, we're well-positioned for long-term sustained double-digit growth. We\u2019ve a vast addressable market. We\u2019ve an attractive recurring revenue business model with strong contribution margins. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow. Next is net income, which will continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. Thanks for joining us today and I look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter results were excellent with strength in contract value growth, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q2 performance. Second quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up 20% year-over-year as reported and 16% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up more than 300 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $355 million, up 85% year-over-year and up 75% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.24. Free cash flow on the quarter was $563 million. Free cash flow includes $150 million from insurance proceeds related to cancelled 2020 conferences. Research revenue in the second quarter grew 15% year-over-year as reported and 11% on an FX neutral basis. We saw strong retention and new business in the quarter. Second quarter research contribution margin was 74%, up about 170 basis points versus 2020. Contribution margins reflect both improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses and lower than planned headcount. However, some of the margin improvement compared to historical levels is temporary and will reverse as we resume normal travel and increased spending to support growth. Total contract value grew 11% FX neutral year-over-year to $3.8 billion at June 30. Quarterly net contract value increased or NCVI was $114 million, significantly better than the pandemic lows in the second quarter of last year and a new record high for second quarter NCVI. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. Global technology sales contract value at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion, up 9% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $75 million from the first quarter. The selling environment continued to improve in the second quarter. By industry, CV growth was led by technology, manufacturing and services. While retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, up about 110 basis points year-over-year. While retention isn't yet fully back to normal because it's a rolling four quarter measure. GTS new business was up 38% versus last year with strength in new logos and continued improvement in upsell with existing clients. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales Contract Value was $770 million at the end of the second quarter, up 18% year-over-year, which is above the high-end of our medium term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $39 million from the first quarter. Broad-based CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. All of our practices including marketing delivered year-over-year and sequential CV growth. HR, finance, sales and supply chain each grew 20% or more year-over-year. While retention for GBS was 110% for the quarter, up more than 950 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 76% over last year, led by very strong growth across the full portfolio. As with GTS our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $58 million compared to no revenue in the year-ago quarter. Contribution margin in the quarter was 73% driven by strong top line performance. We held 13 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Avanta meetings. Second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 9% year-over-year to $106 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 4%. Consulting contribution margin was 40% in the second quarter, up almost 600 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Labor-based revenues were $86 million, up 25% versus Q2 of last year and up 20% on an FX neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 740 was down 7%. Utilization was 70%, up more than 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at June 30 was $108 million, up 7% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter. Our Contract Optimization business was down 31% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and down 33% FX neutral. The prior year period was the highest ever revenue quarter for Contract Optimization and as we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. Consolidated cost of service has increased 9% year-over-year and 6% FX neutral in the second quarter. Cost of services increased due to the reinstatement of annual merit increases and to support growth in the business. SG&A decreased 1% year-over-year and 4% FX neutral in the second quarter. Compared with the prior year period, SG&A declined due to lower severance and conference related expenses partially offset by higher personnel costs. E&E remains close to zero. Operating expenses were lower than planned in part because net headcount growth was below our targets. While our rate of hiring continues to ramp up, turnover remains modestly above normal levels due to tighter labor market conditions. As Gene said, we're rapidly growing our recruiting capacity to keep pace with our accelerating growth rates. EBITDA for the second quarter was $355 million, up 85% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 75% FX neutral. Second quarter EBITDA again reflected revenue above the high-end and cost towards the low-end of our expectations. Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, reflecting real estate and software which went into service since the second quarter of last year. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $26 million, roughly flat versus the second quarter of 2020. The Q2 adjusted tax rate which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 29.9% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 24.6% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $2.24. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the second quarter was 86.6 million shares. We exited the second quarter with 85.1 million fully diluted shares. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $575 million, up 68% compared to last year. Q2 operating cash flow includes $150 million of proceeds from insurance related to 2020 conference cancellations. Excluding the insurance proceeds, operating cash flow improved by 24% versus the prior year quarter. Cash flow strength continues to be driven by EBITDA growth and improved collections. CapEx for the quarter was $12 million, down 44% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $563 million, which was up about 75% versus the prior year. Excluding the insurance proceeds, free cash flow improved by 28% versus the prior year quarter. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 27% on a rolling four quarter basis. Excluding the insurance proceeds, free cash flow was 23% of revenue, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow was well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. At the end of the second quarter, we had $796 million of cash. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of new 8-year senior unsecured notes with a 3.625% coupon. We used the proceeds from this new issuance to repay $100 million of the existing term loan A. The balance is available for general corporate purposes including share repurchases. Our June 30 debt balance was $2.5 billion. At the end of the second quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2.3x. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity and cash to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. During the quarter, we made a small acquisition with net cash paid at closing of $23 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased more than $1 billion in stock, including $685 million during the second quarter. In July, the Board increased our share repurchase authorization for the third time this year, adding another $800 million. As of August 1, we have more than $1 billion available for share repurchases. We expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share, and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q2 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. For Research, the strong start to the year in CV performance and improvement to non-subscription revenue are contributing to higher than previously expected research revenue. For Conferences, our guidance is still based on being virtual for the full year. With the uptick in COVID and shifting government directives, there is much more uncertainty around our ability to run in-person conferences during the balance of the year. We continue to operationally plan for some in-person conferences. Our updated guidance reflects some additional cancellation related costs for conferences where we have been planning to run in-person, but may need to cancel. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. For expenses, we have reinstated benefits which were either cancelled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase, which took effect April 1. We are investing in expanding our recruiting capacity, drive additional hiring across the business. The additional hiring will continue into 2022 and beyond to support current and future growth. Our current plan is to increase quota-bearing headcount in the mid single digits for GTS and low double digits for GBS by the end of 2021. Additionally, we continue to invest in a number of programs with a focus on improving sales productivity. As you know, travel expenses were close to zero from April 2020 through June 2021. Our current plans continue to assume a ramp up in travel related expenses. Over the course of the rest of this year, we add more to the fourth quarter. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings. For our revenue guidance, we now expect research revenue of at least $4 billion, which is growth of 11%. We still expect Conferences revenue of at least $170 million, which is growth of 41%. We still expect Consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of 6%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.57 billion, which is growth of 11%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. The year-over-year FX benefit was more pronounced in the first half of the year. With the ongoing business momentum, we are seeing we will continue to restore growth spending as we move through the year. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1.16 billion, which is an increase of about 42% versus 2020 and reflects reported margins of 25.4%. We expect a reasonable baseline for thinking about the margins going forward is around 18% to 19% consistent with our comments last quarter. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $113 million. Looking out to 2022, as the balance sheet stands today, we expect interest expense to be around $115 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $7.60. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.13 billion. This includes the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter this year. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Turning to the second half of the year. For Research, we have more visibility into revenue the farther we get into the year. This is because NCVI earlier in the year has more of an effect on the full year revenue. Seasonally, Conferences and Consulting are also both typically later in Q3. Finally, at the start of 2021, there was a lot of uncertainty in the world and we began with a prudently conservative plan. More than halfway through the year and with less macro uncertainty, there's a lower likelihood of the kind of upside we've seen in the past few quarters. As a result, we expect reported numbers to be closer to our guidance than earlier in the year. Any upside is more likely to come from lower costs than higher revenue. For Q3, we expect to deliver at least $250 million of EBITDA. We also expect the tax rate for the quarter in the high 20s. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales cost growing in line with CV growth over time, and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 18% to 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us up front. We will repurchase shares over time, which will lower the share count. With a strong first half, with momentum across the business, we have meaningfully updated our outlook for 2021 to reflect the stronger demand environment and our enhanced visibility. We are restoring certain expenses and investing to ensure we are well-positioned to continue our momentum. We repurchased more than $1 billion worth of stock this year, and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? And, Gary, the other thing I would just add, good morning, is as the world has started to reopen, we've had fits and starts with that as well. And so we did have plans to have more travel. And that hasn't panned out given that the situation in the world. We had plans to reopen facilities, a lot of those have just been pushed back further into the year as well. So it's really a combination on the headcount side that Gene just highlighted as well as some other large expense buckets that have just continued to be pushed out into the back half of the year. Yes, it's all three of those things, Gary, I would say. So, things getting pushed out further into the year, including the ramp up in hiring that Gene just talked about. So, let's pretend that we didn't hire all of our needs until December 1 that's obviously not going to happen. But low burden on the 2021 P&L, full year burden on the 2022 P&L. So our outlook in terms of margin for next year is really unchanged from last quarter. This year changed just because, again, we continue to push out certain expanses further and further into the back half of the year. Good morning, Jeff, and thanks for the question. I think in terms of the way we think about the business over the medium term unchanged. And so, again, we believe that over the medium term, we can grow both GTS and GBS in that 12% to 16% range. Obviously, GBS is performing exceptionally well. We've seen it accelerate, even last year the acceleration started, it has continued through the first half of the year. And this [indiscernible] has been a really nice combination of improvements in retention, which you can see in our key metrics as well as great new business growth across the board. So it's not any one practice. It's actually as you alluded to, broad based from industry perspective and from a practice perspective. And so, we remain bullish on GBS. We remain bullish on GTS as well. And over the medium term, again, we believe we can grow both in that 12% to 16% range. Hey, good morning, Toni. I'll start out and then flip it over to Gene on the M&A strategy. You're right, we've repurchased over a $1 billion worth of our stock through the first half of this year. As we've always highlighted, we have two priorities from a capital allocation perspective. And they're not stacked to prioritize. It's 1A and 1B. I would characterize it as, which is returning capital to our shareholders, through buyback programs, and strategic value enhancing M&A, which is largely going to be in the small medium tuck-in size. As we look forward, those remain the two priorities, given what we see in the market. Clearly, in the first half of this year, we put a bias or a priority around returning capital through our buyback programs. But as we move forward, we have ample free cash flow, ample cash on balance sheet, ample balance sheet flexibility for it to be an end. So we can do buybacks and strategic tuck-in M&A as opposed to it being an overstatement. We just happened to put a strong bias towards buybacks through the first half of the year. And I'll flip it to Gene to talk about the M&A side. Anyway to help quantify or give us a sense for how much that can help contribute to productivity?"

            "name": "Gene Hall",
            "content": "Good morning and thanks for joining us. Gartner's positive momentum continued in the second quarter of 2021. We again delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We significantly increased the pace of our buybacks.  Total company revenues were up 16% with strength in all three business segments and research exceeding our expectations. We continue to see growth opportunities across industries, geographies, and every size enterprise. Research is our largest and most profitable segment. Our research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is fast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. Total contract value growth increased to 11% with both GTS and GBS accelerating in the quarter. This was driven by strength in both retention and new business. Global Technology Sales or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. For Q2, GTS contract value growth accelerated to 9% and we have CD growth in all of our top 10 countries. GTS drove strong growth across virtually all industries, including manufacturing, services, and tech and telecom. And we expect GTS contract value growth to continue accelerating, returning to double-digit growth in the future. Global business sales or GPS serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS again accelerated, delivering outstanding contract value growth of 18%. Both practices contributed to our growth. And our HR, finance, sales and supply chain practices each exceeded 20% contract value growth. So across our entire research business, we're seeing the results of a sustained focus, a consistent execution of proven practices. We continued to have a vast market opportunity. And our research business is well-positioned as we continue to deliver long-term sustained double-digit growth. Turning to conferences. For the second quarter of 2021, conferences revenues were $58 million, again exceeding our expectations. As many of you know, during 2020 we were unable to hold in-person conferences. To address this situation we created virtual conferences to deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to our audiences. We continue to operationally prepare for some in-person conferences in the second half of the year if conditions allow. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project based work. Consulting revenues were up 4% in Q2. We had strength in our labor-based business. With labor-based revenue up 20% over this time last year. Contract optimization revenue was down from a record high last year. Overall, Consulting continues to be an important complement to our IT research business. To ensure we keep pace with our accelerating growth rates, we're rapidly growing our recruiting capacity. Our hiring is accelerating. Even in today's tough labor market, candidates see Gartner as a great place for a long-term career. They know we have an incredible impact on our clients, that we're a sales-driven growth company and our growth provides among the best promotion and professional development opportunities for all our associates. With strong revenues and continued disciplined cost management, EBITDA exceeded expectations. Strong EBITDA combined with effective cash management resulted in strong free cash flow. Our priorities for cash flow continue to be strategic, tuck-in acquisitions, like the small one we did this quarter and share repurchases. Summarizing, Q2 was another strong quarter with strength in all three business segments, and research exceeding our expectations. We delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Looking ahead, we're well-positioned for long-term sustained double-digit growth. We have a vast addressable market. We have an attractive recurring revenue business model with strong contribution margins. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which will continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. With that, I'll hand the call over to Craig. Craig? Hey, Gary, it's Gene. So we came into this year with a lot of sales capacity that we've built up over 2019. And so to your point -- you mentioned in your question, we actually have a lot of sales capacity, you're seeing that in our sales results. And so the reason we've been relatively slow to ramp up our sales hiring, our net sales hiring has been we felt like we had plenty of capacity and plenty of opportunity and productivity and we still do. Having said that, as I mentioned earlier in my results, we're now at the point we think it's time to start ramping up that capacity. And so we've been aggressively building our recruiting capability, building our pipeline of candidates and we'd expect to increase that hiring as we go through the year to position us very well for next year and beyond. Yes, hey, Jeff. So, the -- I'd say the biggest issue is where you -- the first you started with, which is with the faster growth in GBS, the rapid acceleration, we've got more of a need to get to -- our net hiring up sooner than we have with GTS. Having said that, as I mentioned in my remarks, turnover is modestly higher and it would be affect-- it affects the people that are in the parts of our business that are technology like our software [indiscernible] even as well as our GTS sales force. And while that's mostly higher, that's only a piece of it. I think it's greater pieces, just kind of my what I said in the earlier question about the timing of when we -- the capacity we have today and the time when we chose to have recruiting start back up again. We have -- we're a great place to work. Our salespeople know that and really love being here. And of course, we're a great place to attract new talents as well. Yes. hey, George. The thing that drives our productivity in both sales forces is we've heard before, which is our recruiting capability, the training portals we have, the tools we have in the process design. And so the thing that's driving productivity is, as the market has gotten, as the recession has come a little bit better, those combination of factors, the recruiting, training, tools and process affect both businesses. And that's what you're seeing what you're seeing drive the productivity improvement. And so over time, we expect both productivity improving in both sales forces. We don't think about it as, one is going to be higher than the other. We expect both will actually have improvements over time. And there's one meaningful difference between GBS and GTS. And that is that we have a higher number of what we call business developers, which are sales people that don't have any existing accounts. GTS has a much larger installed base. And so we have a large number of what we call account executives, whose job is to sell more business to those existing clients. In GTS, we also have the business developers, but in GBS, we have a much higher number of business developers compared to account executives than we do at GTS. That's part of the thing that helps -- that impact sales productivity with GBS both now and over time. Good morning, George. Thanks for the question. Obviously, the second half margins are lower than what we've run through the first half and what the full year implies. Yet, as Gary highlighted as well, it's a little bit higher than the 18% to 19% that we've guided, or at least preliminary -- preliminarily guided around how to think about a normalized margin for this year. And there's really one primary reason for that, and it's the deferral and the pushing out of spending that we expected to come in sooner, just happening a little bit later over the course of 2021, but I was assuming we bear the full burden of that as the business continues to accelerate into 2022. And so, a little bit higher than 80% to 90% is the expectation for the second half of the year. But again, that's largely because we've pushed out and deferred certain expenses to later in this year. But we'll have a full impact on the 2022 P&L. Hey, Toni. Our in-person conferences remain usually popular with our clients. Clients are, I'd say, quite enthusiastic about returning to those in-person conferences and we're looking forward to it. As of -- as we sit here today, I'd say our registrations for the conferences in the U.S haven't been affected very much by the delta variant, that could change over time, if things goes on. But the sentiment, as of just right now, in terms of registrations things, hasn't changed very much. Outside of the U.S., I'd say there's more concern about it, and so it's not the same around the world. Having said that, either there's a concern about the delta variant, the kind of underlying demand there, even the clients that are concerned about the delta variant in terms of attending a conference, if we can address that are wildly enthusiastic about conferences and really want to return back to them. And so, over time, we'd expect when it's safe to do so to be introducing in-person conferences to meet that demand. Yes, Toni, so over time, in general, our acquisitions have been focused on additions to our capabilities in one way or another. So sometimes they've been actual kind of acquisitions to get to talent. Other times it's been product extensions, which we've used. And so I think -- you can think about it as ways to improve our capabilities, either in a direct people sense or in a product offering sense. Andrew, client engagement is really important in our business, when they -- when clients buy our services, they do it to get value out of it. When they get the values, they engage with us. And so, client engagement is up substantially compared to 2019. It's about the same as it was in 2020. And that's partially as you said, due to the environment, there's a lot of uncertainty. But it's also due to the fact that we spend a lot of our energy, thinking of ways that we can actually stimulate an engagement because again, we know we get -- when we get more engagement, we -- our clients get more value out of our services. So it's kind of the two things are related. Good morning, Andrew. Great question. We've actually shifted our guidance methodology to the at least pre-pandemic. And I don't see us slipping back. I think you guys, as you alluded to, obviously, there's been a lot of uncertainty in the world. And we've been trying to since the beginning of the pandemic, plan thoughtfully, planned prudently. And even when we entered this year, I would say plan conservatively as well. As the world has stabilized and we've got a heck of a lot more visibility into how the business is performing. We are still comfortable with the guidance methodology that we have. That said, I'd reiterate what I said in my prepared remarks earlier around your expected variability. On that guidance moving forward, we would expect much less variability, probably more variability on the expense side than on the revenue side. But we are comfortable with the way that we guide now and the current methodology that we use. Hey, Jeff. The -- as I mentioned, turnover across the business is modestly up. And the turnover is going to same places that it's always gone, which is the -- we are known as a company that has great recruiting, training programs. And so there's people like to recruit from us. We're trying to recruit from us. And there's one of the simplest that has gone, which tends to be the technology industry. Yes, Jeff, it's and part of the reason why we got it this way is, the difference will vary on a conference-by-conference basis. So it's very hard, or impossible to answer that question in terms of building your model. And I think the way to think about it is, with our current guide, it is virtual only. That is the best numbers to plug in right now. And as we said, if we are able to run some in-person conferences in the balance of the year, it would be upside to those numbers, but it will depend on the timing or location, and everything else and it will be done on a -- and decisions will be made on a conference-by-conference basis. Yes, sure. It's probably low double digits millions in terms of the potential cancellation costs. It's hard to quantify that right now. Some of them are contractual, some of them will be some [ph] costs that go into to the conference pre-cancellation decision, but it's in the low double-digit million is a current contemplation. Yes, Mario. So as I mentioned, the starting point we have is that our clients, actually really appreciate the value of in-person conferences, and we'd like to get back to them. Having said that, what we're going to do and any -- before we hold in any in-person conference, we're certainly going to follow any government guidelines that are relevant. So where the CDC or the relevant agencies in other countries have said, you shouldn't have large gatherings in this sort of circumstance, even if it's not a regulation, we're going to follow those guidelines. And the third thing is we -- on a regular basis, survey our clients to see how they feel about it as well. And so, we want to reflect their center as well. Even if there were no government guidelines, but our client sentiment was, it's not a safe thing to do that we certainly wouldn't follow that as well. And, of course, we use finally our own assessment. And if we think even if the guidance, okay, and even if clients want to do it, we don't think it's safe. We wouldn't hold them as well. So it's kind of those are the factors that go into the decision making in terms of whether we hold in-person conference or not. Yes, so the first part it's the factors I missed earlier, which is the things that impact productivity are really our recruiting program, making sure we recruit the best people, making sure we bring them on board that they're trained to sell the Gartner kinds of products, equipped with great tools. And if we have the best processes, we're constantly improving those things. And so, over time, we expect those will drive productivity improvements. In terms of tenure compared to where we were in 2019, our tenures, on average, higher because we slowed hiring and so with fewer new -- a lower proportion of new people from our slowed hiring are the average tenure has gone up over time. Yes, I can't quantify it for you. I mean, again, we track the numbers, but we don't -- those aren't things we talked about publicly. And so the, I guess, I'll leave it at the 10 years higher. Well, summarizing today's call, Q2 was another strong quarter. It was strengthened all three business segments, and research exceeding our expectations. We delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. GTS contract value growth accelerated to 9% and GBS contract value growth accelerated to 18%. We're accelerating hiring across our business to keep pace with this growth. Looking ahead, we're well-positioned for long-term sustained double-digit growth. We've a vast addressable market. We've an attractive recurring revenue business model with strong contribution margins. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow. Next is net income, which will continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. Thanks for joining us today and I look forward to updating you again next quarter."

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nGene Hall: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Gartner performance accelerated in the first quarter of 2021. We delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Total revenues were up 6%, with each of our business segments, research, conferences, and consulting, exceeding our expectations. Research is our largest and most profitable segment. Our research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Research has a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. For Q1, GTS contract value grew 5%. First quarter new business was up 21% as a result of new logos and up-sell with existing clients. Client engagement continued to be strong, with content and analyst interaction volumes up to 26% compared to Q1 2020. We saw strong performances across several regions and industries, including tech and midsized enterprises. We expect GTS contract value growth to continue to accelerate in 2021 and return to double-digit growth in the future. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS achieved contract value growth of 12%, its first quarter of double-digit growth. New business growth was a very strong 87% in the quarter. All practices, with the exception of marketing, ended Q1 with double-digit contract value growth rates and all practices delivered positive quarterly NCVI. Across our entire research business, we practiced relentless execution of proven practices and we are seeing the results of our efforts. Our research business is well-positioned to return to sustained double-digit growth over the medium-term. Turning to conferences, as many of you know, during 2020, our conferences business pivoted from in-person destination conferences to virtual. Our value proposition for virtual conferences remains the same as for in-person conferences. We deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. While Q1 is a small quarter for conferences, the business exceeded our expectations. Beyond virtual conferences, we continue to prepare to return to in-person conferences in the second half of 2021. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project-based work. Our Consulting segment also exceeded our expectations, with bookings up 26% during Q1. Our Consulting business will continue to serve as an important complement to our IT research business. One of our objectives is to generate strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $145 million, up significantly versus the prior year. In addition, we used that cash flow plus cash balances to purchase more than $600 million in stock through April of this year. With these repurchases, our board increased our share repurchase authorization by another $500 million. We recently launched our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report. The report details the progress we made in accelerating positive social change and contributing to a more sustainable world. We want our associates, communities and clients to continue to thrive today and in the future. The report can be found on gartner.com and I encourage you to take a look. Summarizing, Q1 was a strong quarter with all three business segments exceeding our expectations. Looking ahead, we are well-positioned for sustained success. We have a vast addressable market, which will allow us to achieve double-digit contract value and revenue growth over the next 5 years and beyond. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we will continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call over to Craig. Craig?\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene and good morning. I hope everyone remains safe and well. First quarter results were outstanding with very good momentum across the business. Revenue was well above our expectations. Despite the lower than planned expenses, we are well-positioned to take advantage of the strong demand environment. We will continue to restore spending to support and drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. With stronger than expected results in contract value, non-subscription research and consulting we are increasing our revenue growth and normalized margin outlook, which results in a meaningful increase to our 2021 guidance. The improved outlook reflects the increased visibility we have following the stronger than expected first quarter. First quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year as reported and 6% FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up more than 320 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $320 million, up 50% year-over-year and up 44% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2 and free cash flow in the quarter was $145 million. Research revenue in the first quarter grew 8% year-over-year as reported and 6% on an FX-neutral basis and we saw strong retention and new business throughout the quarter. First quarter research contribution margin was 74%, up about 200 basis points versus 2020. Higher contribution margins reflect both improved operational effectiveness and the avoidance of travel expenses. Some of the margin improvement compared to historical levels is temporary and will reverse as the world reopens and we increase spending to support growth. We are seeing a benefit from increased scale and a mix shift to higher margin products, including from the discontinuation of certain lower margin marketing products. Total contract value grew 6% FX neutral to $3.7 billion at March 31. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $59 million significantly better than the pandemic affected first quarter last year. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. Global Technology Sales contract value at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, up 5% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $34 million from the fourth quarter. The selling environment continued to improve in the first quarter, but while retention isn\u2019t yet fully back to normal. Moving forward, we expect win backs and a return to more expansion with existing clients to contribute to growth in 2021 consistent with our experience coming out of the last downturn. By industry, CV growth was led by technology, healthcare and services, while retention for GTS was 98% for the quarter, down about 560 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, a majority of our industry group saw retention improve from the fourth quarter. GTS new business was up 21% versus last year with strength in new logos and an improvement in up-sell with existing clients. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $731 million at the end of the first quarter, up 12% year-over-year. GBS CV increased $25 million from the fourth quarter. This was the strongest first quarter performance we have seen from GBS. CV growth was led by the healthcare and technology industries. All practices recorded double-digit CV growth with the exception of marketing, which was impacted by discontinued products. However, our marketing practice saw improving retention rates and a return to year-over-year new business growth in the quarter. All of our practices, including marketing, showed sequential increases in CV from the fourth quarter. While retention for GBS was 104% for the quarter, up more than 330 basis points year-over-year, GBS new business was up 87% over last year led by very strong growth across the full portfolio. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the quarter was $25 million. We had about $10 million of one-time revenue in the quarter. This reflected contract entitlements, which we extended beyond the end of 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Contribution margin in the quarter was 56%. We held 5 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Avanta meetings. First quarter consulting revenues increased by 4% year-over-year to $100 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were flat. Consulting contribution margin was 39% in the first quarter, up 860 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Labor-based revenues were $84 million, up 4% versus Q1 of last year and down 1% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 744 was down 8% due to headcount actions taken in Q2 and Q3 of last year. Utilization was 68%, up about 550 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at March 31 was $116 million, up 3% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after a strong bookings quarter. Our backlog provides us with about 4 months of forward revenue coverage. Our contract optimization business was up 6% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and 3% FX neutral. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services decreased 2% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the first quarter. Cost of services declined due to lower travel and entertainment costs during the quarter as well as the continuation of various cost avoidance initiatives. SG&A decreased 2% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the first quarter as well. SG&A declined due to lower facilities, travel, entertainment, and conference-related expenses as well as the continuation of various cost avoidance initiatives. As CV rebounds this year, our traditional sales productivity metrics will also improve. For 2021, we have ample sales capacity to drive increasing CV growth, a more tenured-than-usual sales force, several consecutive quarters of strong client engagement which should drive improving retention and the insights to help our clients address their most critical priorities. Going forward, in addition to the initiatives to improve sales force productivity and cost effectiveness we have been discussing the past few years, this year we are investing to upgrade many of our sales technology tools. We will be ramping up our sales force hiring later in the year to ensure we have the team in place to drive strong CV growth next year. We still anticipate high single-digit growth in both GTS and GBS headcount by the end of 2021. EBITDA for the first quarter was $320 million, up 50% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 44% FX-neutral. First quarter EBITDA reflected revenue above the high-end and costs toward the low end of our expectations for the first quarter. Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, including real estate and software, which went into service since the first quarter of last year. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $25 million, flat versus the first quarter of 2020. The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 23.5% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 22.4% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2. Recall that about $6 million of equity compensation expense, which we normally would have incurred in the fourth quarter of 2020, shifted into the first quarter of 2021. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the first quarter was 89.1 million shares. The ending fully diluted share count at March 31 was 87.7 million shares. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $157 million compared to $56 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by EBITDA growth, improved collections and cost avoidance initiatives. CapEx for the quarter was $13 million, down 49% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $145 million, which was up about 360% versus the prior year. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model, with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 22% on a rolling four-quarter basis, continuing the improvement we have been making over the past few years. Free cash flow is well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. At the end of the first quarter, we had $446 million of cash. Our March 31, debt balance was $2 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2.2x. We remain very comfortable with our current gross debt level and the corresponding lower leverage multiple. The multiple has reduced predominantly from increased EBITDA. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity and cash to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. During the first quarter, we repurchased $398 million in stock at an average price of about $180 per share. In the month of April, we repurchased more than $200 million of our stock. At the end of April, the board increased our share repurchase authorization for the second time this year, adding another $500 million. As of April 30, we have around $790 million available for open market repurchases. We expect the board will continue to refresh the repurchased authorization as needed going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base to shrink going forward. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time as well. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q1 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. For research, the strong start to the year in CV performance and improvements to non-subscription revenue are contributing to higher than previously expected research revenue. For conferences, our guidance is still based on being virtual for the full year. Operationally, we are planning to re-launch in-person Avanta meetings in the third quarter and in-person destination conferences starting in September. Our guidance includes fixed costs, primarily people and marketing related to both a full year of virtual and a partial year of in-person conferences. We have excluded the variable costs, primarily venue-related associated with in-person conferences from our guidance. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. For consulting revenues, demand started the year better than we expected and the backlog improved during the first quarter. For expenses, we have reinstated benefits, which were either canceled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase, which took effect April 1. We also plan to increase quota-bearing headcount in the high single-digits for both GTS and GBS by the end of 2021. Additionally, we continue to invest in several other programs. The impact of most of these expense restorations or investments impacts our P&L starting in the second quarter. As you know, travel expenses were close to zero from April 2020 through March 2021. Our current plans continue to assume a modest ramp up in travel-related expenses over the course of 2021. Most of this ramp is built into the second half of the year. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we have assumed, we would see expense savings. For our revenue guidance, we now expect research revenue of at least $3.935 billion, which is growth of at least 9.2%. We expect conferences revenue of at least $170 million, which is growth of at least 42%. We now expect consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of at least 6.4%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.5 billion, which is growth of 9.9%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. The year-over-year FX benefit is more pronounced in the first half of the year. With the ongoing business momentum we are seeing, we are planning to restore growth spending as we move through the year. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1 billion, which is an increase of about 22.3% versus 2020 and reported margins of at least 22%. This is based on conferences running virtual-only. The 18% to 19% expected margins in the back half of the year should provide a reasonable run-rate for thinking about the margins going forward as we will have more fully restored costs and resumed growth hiring. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $102 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $6.25. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $850 million. This is before any insurance proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellations. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Finally, we expect to deliver at least $270 million of EBITDA in Q2 of 2021. We expect the second quarter tax rate in the high 20s. Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales cost growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 18% to 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA, because of our modest Capex needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. We will repurchase shares over time, which will lower the share count as well. We had a strong start to the year with momentum across the business. We have meaningfully updated our outlook for 2021 to reflect the stronger demand environment and our enhanced visibility. We are restoring certain expenses and investing to ensure we are well positioned to rebound as the economy recovers. We repurchased more than $600 million worth of stock this year through the end of April and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator and we will be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is now open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thanks. So anything further to say on the GBS metrics and how you look at the opportunity? Gene, you have obviously been really positive on it for a while and many on this call have been skeptical. But beyond I told you so answer like is it that there is a much richer seats per client opportunity because of all of the different verticals that you serve within GBS, just trying to I guess better understand how the new business sold for instance, could be up 87%?\nGene Hall: Hi, Jeff. No. So, GBS has been accelerating over several quarters if you look back. And what\u2019s going on is as you said, there is a tremendous growth opportunity, the untapped market in GBS \u2013 in GTS, it\u2019s a huge untapped market. In GBS, we are even less penetrated than that. And so, the first piece of it is there is an incredibly large market opportunity. The second piece of it is that we had to get all of the elements that we know that are part of the Gartner formula lined up to fully realize that opportunity and it\u2019s things like training the sales force, we introduced a whole set of products, which the GxL products we talked about over time. And the combination of both getting our sales force up to speed on the kind of Gartner way we sell and getting all the new products introduced and making sure the sales force understood on how to sell them, that has resulted in us getting and implementing all the kind of process improvements that we\u2019ve used historically and continue to improve. You pull all those things together, and that\u2019s resulted in GBS accelerating each of the quarters, as we talked about earlier. And so it\u2019s a combination of all the sort of applying subtle versions, it\u2019s applying the Gartner formula to the GBS market where we have this incredibly huge opportunity.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. And then I guess, I was \u2013 I know you said it was from Q2 and Q3 actions, but I was surprised that how much sales headcount was down sequentially with the momentum that seems to be building in the business. I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s not an issue here given the CV and new business sold metrics. But can you just help us maybe understand like the sales retention of the A players are those that you want to retain? How was it around year end? And then as you think about sales force headcount planning, I guess, how is the apparatus functioning for hiring new salespeople in a remote work and training environments or do you kind of need to get back to the office to release spend that up? Thanks.\nGene Hall: So in a remote environment as well as in office environment, we have a great value proposition to attract sellers to Gartner. We have over time, and we continue to be \u2013 if you want to be in the selling field, Gartner is the place to be. And by the way, we have had remote salespeople for a long time, many probably \u2013 a large proportion of our field salespeople are actually deployed remotely even before the pandemic. And so we\u2019re used to working remotely there. We use the opportunity of the pandemic to look at what sales territories were most productive. And our sales headcount did go down a little bit as we looked at areas that we thought that were less productive than we could actually invest better. And if you look at our sales productivity, for 2021, we have plenty of capacity to continue to accelerate the terms of our growth for both GBS and GTS. Then going forward, as Craig said, during the year, we expect to accelerate our hiring and end the year with high single-digit growth in headcount in both GBS and GTS, which positions us really well for 2022 to continue the growth as we\u2019ve done in the past.\nCraig Safian: And Gene, the other thing \u2013 Jeff, the other thing I would add is one of the things we are very mindful of last year is to not cut into our recruiting capacity base or selling organizations. And so, we really did maintain recruiting capacity, so that when we wanted to turn it back on, we have the ability to turn it back on relatively quickly. And again, we do believe and we\u2019re confident in our ability to get to those high single-digit growth rates for both GTS and GBS this year.\nJeff Meuler: Helpful. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. I was hoping you could dive into the margin drivers a little bit more, and just talk about the sustainability of the strengths there. I know you talked about travel being a potential lever in terms of the delta between what your guidance could be an upside. But maybe also talk about the shift to the higher-margin products that you talked about and the sales force ramp being faster or slower and how to think about the drivers for the year on the margin side? Thanks.\nCraig Safian: Sure. Good morning, Toni. Thank for that. On the margins, clearly, Q1 was an exceptionally strong margin performance. And as we talked about, earlier, it was a combination of super strong performance on the top line and under-spending versus our estimates, sort of across the board, resulting in very strong EBITDA and very strong EBITDA margins. As we look out over the balance of the year, we expect margins in the 18% to 19% range for the balance of the year, for the second half of the year. And we feel like that\u2019s a good baseline because we will have fully restored or at least begun \u2013 begin restoring all the expenses that we have been avoiding for the last several quarters that we want to put back in. We will be aggressively adding growth to our sales force in a number of other areas and also investing in key areas that we believe are super important for us to be able to sustain double-digit growth. Obviously, moving forward, the business is going to look a little bit different. The P&L is going to look a little bit different than it did pre pandemic. And clearly, our expectations around our normal operating margins, or EBITDA margins, are a lot higher than they were pre pandemic. And that\u2019s because of some of the structural changes that you alluded to Toni that we are going to fully harvest moving forward. And so those are things like having lower overall travel expenses. We have learned through the pandemic that we do want to travel and we do need to travel but we don\u2019t need to spend nearly as much \u2013 or drive as much volume in terms of travel to run our business going forward. I think similarly, with facilities, we have the ability now to reallocate and reapportion our facility footprint which means we can really grow into what we currently have and we shouldn\u2019t need to meaningfully increase our facilities expenses as we did historically when we added lots of people. We always needed to make sure we grow our facilities. Those are the two big ones. And then the last thing I would mention, just on your point on the margin side, we are benefiting from a few things there. One is \u2013 and I\u2019ll give you the example, is within the marketing practice. And as we told you several quarters ago, we discontinued several low margin products, and the sales team has been focused on replacing them with higher-margin products. And we\u2019re seeing that happen in the marketing practice, and we\u2019re also seeing that happen in several of our other practices, including GTS as well, which is certainly helping the overall gross margin and overall margin profile as well. And then lastly, clearly with GBS growing the way it is, we\u2019re adding scale to each of the practices that we serve and support as well, which is clearly helping on the economic and margin front as well.\nToni Kaplan: That\u2019s helpful. And during the prepared remarks, you mentioned upgrading your sales technology tools. Is this a major program or just a more modest upgrade? And can you talk about how long that might take and when we start to see the benefits and just what kind of benefits we should expect there? Thanks.\nGene Hall: So Toni, yes, as you know, one of the important elements of growing sales productivity is the tools we provide our sales force. We\u2019ve been focused on that over time. And in fact, over the last couple of years specifically, we\u2019ve done a program to upgrade all of the \u2013 many of the internal systems that support sales, things like billing systems, things like that, that impact sales productivity in an indirect way because salespeople use them, even though it\u2019s not necessarily the toolings everyday. In addition to that, we are currently in the process of implementing a new CRM system, which we use by sales as well as other people throughout the business. And as we design that system, we know there are a number of opportunities to put capabilities of that system that we believe will enhance sales productivity over time. And in fact, not just sales productivity, but also help our service teams be more effective as well.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nGary Bisbee: Hey, guys. Good morning and terrific results. I guess let me ask one about free cash flow. Craig, you introduced this concept in the last couple of quarters of a free cash flow margin. Given the higher-normalized EBITDA margin commentary you just provided, is it reasonable to think that the free cash flow margin may be somewhat better beyond this year than how you\u2019ve been framing that previously?\nCraig Safian: Good morning, Gary, and great question. Yes, so I think the way that we think about the free cash flow margin is running about 3 points below the EBITDA margin. And so with an improved EBITDA margin outlook, the free cash flow margin outlook moves up in conjunction with that. And it\u2019s \u2013 obviously, the EBITDA growth is sort of the primary fuel for the strong free cash flow. But clearly, our focus on managing that CapEx line and also our focus on making sure that our collections pacing and collections efficiency, is strong as well or the things that are driving our updated outlook on that free cash flow margin.\nGary Bisbee: Okay, great. And then just a question on the new business metric and the strength across both segments, how much of this would you attribute to just sort of catch-up to what was, obviously, a period of time where it was very difficult to sell a couple of quarters ago versus improvement in the underlying momentum? Certainly, GBS, it feels like you\u2019ve had that momentum improving regardless of the pandemic impact for a number of quarters now. But on the GTS side, is it more just catch-up or has just the continued dynamic change in technology, driving real underlying growth other than just catch-up from a couple of tough quarters to sell? Thank you.\nGene Hall: Yes, Gary, great question. And I think it\u2019s actually both. I think there is clearly some pent-up demand where people want to buy our services, but the company \u2013 our clients were cautious in the past in terms of \u2013 which extended selling cycles and obviously left some pent-up demand. So I think we\u2019re certainly seeing some of that. In addition, though, to your point, every business has now figured out that they want to be \u2013 that they need to be a digital business. And so that\u2019s clearly also supporting new business growth as well. And in GBS in particular, again, I just think we \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve just been getting better and better at every aspect of our business. Both the products are better, the sales execution, sales support is great, the service support is great. And so I think we\u2019re getting better over time. So it\u2019s a combination of those factors.\nGary Bisbee: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. GBS CV growth was 12% in the quarter. How do you expect GBS CV to perform over the remainder of the year, especially considering CV comps get easier as we move through the year?\nCraig Safian: Good morning, George. Go ahead, Gene, do you want to take it?\nGene Hall: Go ahead, Craig. Go ahead.\nCraig Safian: Okay, thanks. So I think with \u2013 obviously, with the GBS CV growth, we\u2019ve seen an acceleration in that metric over the last few quarters. And I\u2019d agree with you that the Q1 and Q2 comps were easier. I think with the acceleration we saw in contract value growth and in new business strength the second half of last year, the GBS comps, I wouldn\u2019t say are particularly easy. We do feel really good about where we are with the GBS business and have a lot of strength there. And again, logging 87% year-over-year new business growth even on an easy compare is still a pretty impressive number. So we feel good about where the CV balance is at the end of the first quarter. The pipeline looks strong. Our sales teams, we all feel good about the future. We don\u2019t guide on CV specifically, as you know, George. And so we\u2019re not going to provide what we think the number is going to be in Q3 or Q4, but we do feel very good about the pacing and the strength of the business that we\u2019ve seen. And the other thing I\u2019d mention is the really nice thing about the GBS growth, and both Gene and I alluded to this earlier is its real great strength across all of the major practices. And we\u2019re starting to see marketing chip in as well, which is great. So it\u2019s not just one practice that is driving the growth. We\u2019re seeing really strong growth in HR, in supply chain, in finance, in legal, in sales and with marketing starting to gain altitude as well. So we do feel good about the strength of the GBS business right now.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. You mentioned under-spending a bit in 1Q and that you\u2019re now targeting 18% to 19% normalized EBITDA margins in the second half of the year, which is going to be the base of which to expand margins going forward. How should we think about margins more near-term, say, in 2Q?\nCraig Safian: Yes, so the margins in 2Q, based on what we\u2019re seeing from a revenue outlook perspective, will also be probably a little bit higher than normal, it will be a little bit higher than normal just based on the pacing of us making the investments and putting the money to work. And so, as we talked about, one of the big investments, obviously, is growing the sales forces. And that will happen in ramp over the balance of the year. And so, we will have some of that hit in Q2, but then it sort of compounds as we roll into Q3 and Q4. And so, I think, the Q2 margins will be higher than that normalized level that we\u2019re talking about for the second half of the year, for sure.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Given the strength in both GTS and GBS, it would certainly seem like a pretty receptive end market. Just wondering how aggressive you can be on the hiring front. I know you mentioned sticking with high single-digit growth in headcount in both businesses and that\u2019s certainly not a small number. But did you give any thought to accelerating that growth even further? Are there limitations to how quickly you can add bodies or any other considerations worth keeping in mind?\nGene Hall: Yes, hi Andrew, it\u2019s Gene. Great question. So as we look at our sales force today, we believe we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity in terms of improving our sales productivity. And so we want to make sure we capture that capacity as well and then complement that with growth. As we said, our target right now is in the high single digits this year to position us really well for next year in terms of double-digit growth. And so that\u2019s kind of our plan right now.\nAndrew Nicholas: Got it. Thank you. And then maybe a bigger-picture question. We are over a year now from what most would consider to be the start of the pandemic. I was hoping you could spend some time kind of discussing what you think are the biggest learnings for the management team in terms of running the business. Obviously, you spent time on the cost structure already, so probably don\u2019t need to spend more time there. But maybe on kind of sales force training or execution or the optimal conference mix between hybrid and in-person content engagement, whatever it is, just love to hear kind of the top two or three things that you feel like you\u2019re taking away from the past year that you might not have otherwise had transparency into. Thanks.\nGene Hall: Yes, Andrew, it\u2019s a great question. We\u2019ve thought about it a lot. There is the old adage about the tough times make you stronger, I think, certainly applies to how we feel about it for us in the sense that when the pandemic hit last year it was pretty tough. And so, there were a lot of innovations we tried. We really were \u2013 had the largest set of innovative things that we tried in \u2013 I guess, in the second \u2013 beginning second quarter of last year, things like different kinds of formats for adding value remotely, things like that. And what we found is that the whole wave of innovation has resulted in some learnings. Some stuff didn\u2019t work that great. Some stuff worked really, really well, and we\u2019re going to continue that \u2013 those things going forward. So I think one learning is just that there were a bunch of specific innovations that we came up with. An example of it kind of is very clear is virtual conferences where we didn\u2019t have any virtual conferences before. It certainly begs the question going forward. We\u2019ve learned to be very successful with virtual conferences. Well, when we can go back to in-person, should we continue those virtual conferences as well, which we almost certainly will in different circumstances. Similarly, with our products, we learned some ways to add value remotely that we hadn\u2019t used before that we will continue to use going forward. We also learned that we need less travel \u2013 as Craig said earlier, we\u2019d probably need less travel than we thought we did before the pandemic. We also \u2013 we\u2019ve always had a large \u2013 a relatively large share of our workforce working remotely, but for the pandemic, where everybody working remotely. So again, we developed new work practices that will, I think, improve our productivity going forward for all of our remote workers, even when some of our workers are back in the office. So those are some examples of some of the learnings that we\u2019ve had from the \u2013 this time we\u2019ve gone through this pandemic time.\nAndrew Nicholas: Thanks, Gene.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. And let me add my congratulations as well. My first question is just on the guidance for the year. It looks like you took revenue guidance up about $140 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance up about $240 million. I know you had that big upside in the first quarter, I don\u2019t think you provided official guidance. But compared to where we were three months ago, are you also raising expectations for the last three quarters of the year or is it just basically on the first quarter upside surprise?\nCraig Safian: Hey, good morning, Jeff. It\u2019s a combination of both. So the strength we saw in the first quarter or the source of the beat, if you will, was a combination of revenue strength which sticks. And also, because a lot of it was CV strength, we get to flow that through now the balance of the year combined with lightness in spending. And we are going to be increasing costs nicely and consistently over the next three quarters. That said, it\u2019s a little bit lighter than what we originally baked into our forecast just based on some of the softness we saw in Q1 and our ability to ramp up as quickly as we want to. So it is definitely a combination of the Q1 over performance and then extending that through the balance of the year, given the momentum we\u2019ve seen, not only on the subscription part of the research business, but the non-subscription part of the research business, the strength we saw in bookings and backlog in the quarter allowed us to increase our consulting outlook. We increased our conferences outlook a little bit as well. So it was strength across the board. And I\u2019d say the other big thing is, obviously, getting through the first quarter gave us a lot more visibility into not only what happened in the rearview mirror during the first quarter, but the outlook as well and the combination of all those things gave us the confidence to increase the overall outlook for the year the way you see in our updated guidance.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Appreciate that. And if I could just switch back to Research, I know you talked about strength across all verticals. I wonder if you can give us some comments about geographies. I\u2019m just curious how the U.S. is doing versus the non-U.S., and if there is any international countries to call out either positively or negative, that would be great. Thanks.\nGene Hall: Yes, I mean, basically \u2013 go ahead, Craig.\nCraig Safian: No, please. Go ahead. You got it.\nGene Hall: Yes, so the \u2013 what I\u2019d say is, the \u2013 we did well around the world. The U.S. was stronger than some other markets, and there are some markets, like you can imagine, India, which isn\u2019t big for us, but didn\u2019t grow as well. Europe didn\u2019t grow as fast as the U.S. So you think about kind of \u2013 it correlates pretty closely to how the pandemic is doing around the world.\nJeff Silber: Okay. That\u2019s what I thought. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Gene, I just wanted to ask just on GBS again. Obviously, the growth was very impressive. I just wanted to really talk about the dynamic of the client count in GBS continue to decline. I was just hoping you could just talk about that again.\nGene Hall: So, Manav, are you asking about \u2013 just to clarify, are you asking about what\u2019s happened with the growth in the number of clients?\nManav Patnaik: Yes, I mean, the \u2013 you\u2019re selling obviously \u2013 it sounds as with the wallet retention maybe you\u2019re selling more of the existing plans, but that client count that you report keeps declining. So I\u2019m just curious what\u2019s happening there.\nCraig Safian: Gene, yes. I\u2019ll...\nGene Hall: Yes. So \u2013 yes, go ahead.\nCraig Safian: Good morning, Manav. Sorry. So I think a couple of things. One is, it\u2019s down year-over-year, but we\u2019ve actually seen nice sequential improvement, particularly from fourth quarter into Q1. If you\u2019ll remember, Manav, the way we go to market in GBS is essentially by functional area. And so just because a client might be an HR client, we\u2019ve got a team that goes in and then tries to convert the finance team and bring them honest clients. And so, we are able to generate really nice growth from existing enterprises because we may only have one function. As clients, we may have two, we may have three, we may have four, and it varies across the board. And so I think, the strength in GBS new business was a combination of new logo growth and expanding within existing client enterprises. But even, again, to understand our point, when we are expanding in client enterprises, it is often like a brand-new client, where they have gone from zero CV in finance, they become a finance client. And again, it won\u2019t increment up necessarily the client enterprise count. But again, we did see a nice sequential bump from 4Q into the first quarter and a large portion of that new business strength we saw in GBS in the first quarter could be attributed to brand-new logos.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And Craig, just on the guidance, obviously, understandably given the COVID dynamics, you\u2019ve gone through this kind of at least guidance number that you gave out there. And I just wanted to have you talk a little bit more about the increased visibility you talked about, but still perhaps what else is cloudy out there of the Events business? Just to try and gauge how conservative you\u2019re still being with these numbers?\nCraig Safian: Sure, yes. So we actually converted to the at least pre pandemic. It gets associated with the it \u2013 with the pandemic, but we had actually converted to this way of guiding just prior to the pandemic. Yes, I think, we want to guide in ways that we feel that we are very confident that we will be able to achieve that guidance. And the way we\u2019ve been updating our guidance each quarter over the last several quarters is we analyzed what happened in the most recent quarter. We utilized the enhanced visibility we have from a performance in that quarter and looking forward. And then we flow that through both our top line metrics and on the expense side as well. I think, in particular, we were a little cautious entering the year, particularly with thinking about the CV ramp, which drives the bulk of our \u2013 bulk of our revenue for the business. And we had a really strong first quarter from a CV ramp perspective. And the beauty of that is we had some benefit in the first quarter. But the reality is the bulk of that benefit flows through to the balance of the year as we recognize that revenue. And now we\u2019ve got a view into Q2 pipeline and into Q3 pipeline as well. So we just have that advanced \u2013 enhanced visibility as well. And so again, I think, from a guidance perspective, these are numbers that, based on everything we\u2019re seeing, based on most recent performance, based on the visibility that we have around subsequent quarters or quarters that are coming up, this is what we believe the business is going to perform at. And that hasn\u2019t really changed in terms of our, I\u2019d say, guidance philosophy or guidance methodology. So just given the volatility in the overall selling environment driven by the pandemic, driven by recessions, driven by other things. Obviously, the visibility does change or the facts that drive the visibility have been changing very rapidly quarter-to-quarter, and we\u2019ve been adjusting on that each and every quarter since. And so from where we sit today, the updated guide, while it is significantly higher than what we had guided originally in the year, those are the numbers we feel very confident with.\nManav Patnaik: Alright. Thanks a lot, Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is John filling in for Hamzah. Could you talk a bit about your current penetration level? I believe it sits around four to six seats across the enterprise. Where do you think it could go from here? Thanks.\nGene Hall: So great question, John. I mean the \u2013 we have two levels that were under-penetrated. One is just the number of enterprises that we have. As we talked about before, we have more than 100,000 enterprises that we target today. And so we have a large number of enterprises we can go after. And then secondly then, within each enterprise, we have a lot of opportunity for additional seats. And it\u2019s a little different with GTS and GBS. With GTS, if you think about it as being within the technology organizations, those are large organizations, they are growing. And even among our existing clients, there is tremendous growth opportunities, we have products for, obviously, the C level, their direct reports and then on down through to their organization. And then if you look at GBS, then you have each of the functions, as Craig mentioned earlier, finance, marketing, sales, legal, etcetera. And each of those functions today, we have very, very low penetration in both enterprises, and we still have the same opportunity to add seats for each of those organizations as well. And many of those organizations are quite large, like you think about the sales organization, for example, our finance organization. There is just enormous opportunities there. And so the \u2013 whether it\u2019s GTS or GBS, we have huge opportunities, both for additional enterprises, but also for individual seats within those enterprises, both directly reporting \u2013 the C level \u2013 reporting the C level and then throughout the organization.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. Maybe could you just walk us through how sales trends progressed throughout the quarter from January, February and March? And then if you have any thoughts on April, did we accelerate throughout the quarter? Thanks.\nGene Hall: So what I\u2019d say is the selling environment improved throughout the quarter. In particular, I think, selling cycles became shorter throughout the quarter. And what most clients would say is that they got more visibility in terms of their own operations. And so knew better what kind of money \u2013 budget money they had and so I would sort of say the selling arm got better throughout the quarter.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Gene Hall for closing remarks.\nGene Hall: So summarizing today\u2019s call, Q1 was a strong quarter. We stated expectations across all three of our business segments: Research, Conferences, and Consulting. GBS delivered its first quarter of double-digit growth. And across GTS and GBS, we had very strong new business growth. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for success, for sustained success. And we have a vast addressable market, which will allow us to achieve double-digit contract value and revenue growth over the next 5 years and beyond. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we will continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene and good morning. I hope everyone remains safe and well. First quarter results were outstanding with very good momentum across the business. Revenue was well above our expectations. Despite the lower than planned expenses, we are well-positioned to take advantage of the strong demand environment. We will continue to restore spending to support and drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. With stronger than expected results in contract value, non-subscription research and consulting we are increasing our revenue growth and normalized margin outlook, which results in a meaningful increase to our 2021 guidance. The improved outlook reflects the increased visibility we have following the stronger than expected first quarter. First quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year as reported and 6% FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up more than 320 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $320 million, up 50% year-over-year and up 44% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2 and free cash flow in the quarter was $145 million. Research revenue in the first quarter grew 8% year-over-year as reported and 6% on an FX-neutral basis and we saw strong retention and new business throughout the quarter. First quarter research contribution margin was 74%, up about 200 basis points versus 2020. Higher contribution margins reflect both improved operational effectiveness and the avoidance of travel expenses. Some of the margin improvement compared to historical levels is temporary and will reverse as the world reopens and we increase spending to support growth. We are seeing a benefit from increased scale and a mix shift to higher margin products, including from the discontinuation of certain lower margin marketing products. Total contract value grew 6% FX neutral to $3.7 billion at March 31. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $59 million significantly better than the pandemic affected first quarter last year. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. Global Technology Sales contract value at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, up 5% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $34 million from the fourth quarter. The selling environment continued to improve in the first quarter, but while retention isn't yet fully back to normal. Moving forward, we expect win backs and a return to more expansion with existing clients to contribute to growth in 2021 consistent with our experience coming out of the last downturn. By industry, CV growth was led by technology, healthcare and services, while retention for GTS was 98% for the quarter, down about 560 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, a majority of our industry group saw retention improve from the fourth quarter. GTS new business was up 21% versus last year with strength in new logos and an improvement in up-sell with existing clients. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $731 million at the end of the first quarter, up 12% year-over-year. GBS CV increased $25 million from the fourth quarter. This was the strongest first quarter performance we have seen from GBS. CV growth was led by the healthcare and technology industries. All practices recorded double-digit CV growth with the exception of marketing, which was impacted by discontinued products. However, our marketing practice saw improving retention rates and a return to year-over-year new business growth in the quarter. All of our practices, including marketing, showed sequential increases in CV from the fourth quarter. While retention for GBS was 104% for the quarter, up more than 330 basis points year-over-year, GBS new business was up 87% over last year led by very strong growth across the full portfolio. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the quarter was $25 million. We had about $10 million of one-time revenue in the quarter. This reflected contract entitlements, which we extended beyond the end of 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Contribution margin in the quarter was 56%. We held 5 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Avanta meetings. First quarter consulting revenues increased by 4% year-over-year to $100 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were flat. Consulting contribution margin was 39% in the first quarter, up 860 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Labor-based revenues were $84 million, up 4% versus Q1 of last year and down 1% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 744 was down 8% due to headcount actions taken in Q2 and Q3 of last year. Utilization was 68%, up about 550 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at March 31 was $116 million, up 3% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after a strong bookings quarter. Our backlog provides us with about 4 months of forward revenue coverage. Our contract optimization business was up 6% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and 3% FX neutral. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services decreased 2% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the first quarter. Cost of services declined due to lower travel and entertainment costs during the quarter as well as the continuation of various cost avoidance initiatives. SG&A decreased 2% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the first quarter as well. SG&A declined due to lower facilities, travel, entertainment, and conference-related expenses as well as the continuation of various cost avoidance initiatives. As CV rebounds this year, our traditional sales productivity metrics will also improve. For 2021, we have ample sales capacity to drive increasing CV growth, a more tenured-than-usual sales force, several consecutive quarters of strong client engagement which should drive improving retention and the insights to help our clients address their most critical priorities. Going forward, in addition to the initiatives to improve sales force productivity and cost effectiveness we have been discussing the past few years, this year we are investing to upgrade many of our sales technology tools. We will be ramping up our sales force hiring later in the year to ensure we have the team in place to drive strong CV growth next year. We still anticipate high single-digit growth in both GTS and GBS headcount by the end of 2021. EBITDA for the first quarter was $320 million, up 50% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 44% FX-neutral. First quarter EBITDA reflected revenue above the high-end and costs toward the low end of our expectations for the first quarter. Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, including real estate and software, which went into service since the first quarter of last year. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $25 million, flat versus the first quarter of 2020. The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 23.5% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 22.4% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2. Recall that about $6 million of equity compensation expense, which we normally would have incurred in the fourth quarter of 2020, shifted into the first quarter of 2021. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the first quarter was 89.1 million shares. The ending fully diluted share count at March 31 was 87.7 million shares. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $157 million compared to $56 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by EBITDA growth, improved collections and cost avoidance initiatives. CapEx for the quarter was $13 million, down 49% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $145 million, which was up about 360% versus the prior year. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model, with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 22% on a rolling four-quarter basis, continuing the improvement we have been making over the past few years. Free cash flow is well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. At the end of the first quarter, we had $446 million of cash. Our March 31, debt balance was $2 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2.2x. We remain very comfortable with our current gross debt level and the corresponding lower leverage multiple. The multiple has reduced predominantly from increased EBITDA. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity and cash to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. During the first quarter, we repurchased $398 million in stock at an average price of about $180 per share. In the month of April, we repurchased more than $200 million of our stock. At the end of April, the board increased our share repurchase authorization for the second time this year, adding another $500 million. As of April 30, we have around $790 million available for open market repurchases. We expect the board will continue to refresh the repurchased authorization as needed going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base to shrink going forward. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time as well. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q1 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. For research, the strong start to the year in CV performance and improvements to non-subscription revenue are contributing to higher than previously expected research revenue. For conferences, our guidance is still based on being virtual for the full year. Operationally, we are planning to re-launch in-person Avanta meetings in the third quarter and in-person destination conferences starting in September. Our guidance includes fixed costs, primarily people and marketing related to both a full year of virtual and a partial year of in-person conferences. We have excluded the variable costs, primarily venue-related associated with in-person conferences from our guidance. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. For consulting revenues, demand started the year better than we expected and the backlog improved during the first quarter. For expenses, we have reinstated benefits, which were either canceled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase, which took effect April 1. We also plan to increase quota-bearing headcount in the high single-digits for both GTS and GBS by the end of 2021. Additionally, we continue to invest in several other programs. The impact of most of these expense restorations or investments impacts our P&L starting in the second quarter. As you know, travel expenses were close to zero from April 2020 through March 2021. Our current plans continue to assume a modest ramp up in travel-related expenses over the course of 2021. Most of this ramp is built into the second half of the year. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we have assumed, we would see expense savings. For our revenue guidance, we now expect research revenue of at least $3.935 billion, which is growth of at least 9.2%. We expect conferences revenue of at least $170 million, which is growth of at least 42%. We now expect consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of at least 6.4%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.5 billion, which is growth of 9.9%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. The year-over-year FX benefit is more pronounced in the first half of the year. With the ongoing business momentum we are seeing, we are planning to restore growth spending as we move through the year. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1 billion, which is an increase of about 22.3% versus 2020 and reported margins of at least 22%. This is based on conferences running virtual-only. The 18% to 19% expected margins in the back half of the year should provide a reasonable run-rate for thinking about the margins going forward as we will have more fully restored costs and resumed growth hiring. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $102 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $6.25. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $850 million. This is before any insurance proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellations. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Finally, we expect to deliver at least $270 million of EBITDA in Q2 of 2021. We expect the second quarter tax rate in the high 20s. Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales cost growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 18% to 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA, because of our modest Capex needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. We will repurchase shares over time, which will lower the share count as well. We had a strong start to the year with momentum across the business. We have meaningfully updated our outlook for 2021 to reflect the stronger demand environment and our enhanced visibility. We are restoring certain expenses and investing to ensure we are well positioned to rebound as the economy recovers. We repurchased more than $600 million worth of stock this year through the end of April and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator and we will be happy to take your questions. Operator? And Gene, the other thing \u2013 Jeff, the other thing I would add is one of the things we are very mindful of last year is to not cut into our recruiting capacity base or selling organizations. And so, we really did maintain recruiting capacity, so that when we wanted to turn it back on, we have the ability to turn it back on relatively quickly. And again, we do believe and we're confident in our ability to get to those high single-digit growth rates for both GTS and GBS this year. Sure. Good morning, Toni. Thank for that. On the margins, clearly, Q1 was an exceptionally strong margin performance. And as we talked about, earlier, it was a combination of super strong performance on the top line and under-spending versus our estimates, sort of across the board, resulting in very strong EBITDA and very strong EBITDA margins. As we look out over the balance of the year, we expect margins in the 18% to 19% range for the balance of the year, for the second half of the year. And we feel like that's a good baseline because we will have fully restored or at least begun \u2013 begin restoring all the expenses that we have been avoiding for the last several quarters that we want to put back in. We will be aggressively adding growth to our sales force in a number of other areas and also investing in key areas that we believe are super important for us to be able to sustain double-digit growth. Obviously, moving forward, the business is going to look a little bit different. The P&L is going to look a little bit different than it did pre pandemic. And clearly, our expectations around our normal operating margins, or EBITDA margins, are a lot higher than they were pre pandemic. And that's because of some of the structural changes that you alluded to Toni that we are going to fully harvest moving forward. And so those are things like having lower overall travel expenses. We have learned through the pandemic that we do want to travel and we do need to travel but we don't need to spend nearly as much \u2013 or drive as much volume in terms of travel to run our business going forward. I think similarly, with facilities, we have the ability now to reallocate and reapportion our facility footprint which means we can really grow into what we currently have and we shouldn't need to meaningfully increase our facilities expenses as we did historically when we added lots of people. We always needed to make sure we grow our facilities. Those are the two big ones. And then the last thing I would mention, just on your point on the margin side, we are benefiting from a few things there. One is \u2013 and I'll give you the example, is within the marketing practice. And as we told you several quarters ago, we discontinued several low margin products, and the sales team has been focused on replacing them with higher-margin products. And we're seeing that happen in the marketing practice, and we're also seeing that happen in several of our other practices, including GTS as well, which is certainly helping the overall gross margin and overall margin profile as well. And then lastly, clearly with GBS growing the way it is, we're adding scale to each of the practices that we serve and support as well, which is clearly helping on the economic and margin front as well. Good morning, Gary, and great question. Yes, so I think the way that we think about the free cash flow margin is running about 3 points below the EBITDA margin. And so with an improved EBITDA margin outlook, the free cash flow margin outlook moves up in conjunction with that. And it's \u2013 obviously, the EBITDA growth is sort of the primary fuel for the strong free cash flow. But clearly, our focus on managing that CapEx line and also our focus on making sure that our collections pacing and collections efficiency, is strong as well or the things that are driving our updated outlook on that free cash flow margin. Good morning, George. Go ahead, Gene, do you want to take it? Okay, thanks. So I think with \u2013 obviously, with the GBS CV growth, we've seen an acceleration in that metric over the last few quarters. And I'd agree with you that the Q1 and Q2 comps were easier. I think with the acceleration we saw in contract value growth and in new business strength the second half of last year, the GBS comps, I wouldn't say are particularly easy. We do feel really good about where we are with the GBS business and have a lot of strength there. And again, logging 87% year-over-year new business growth even on an easy compare is still a pretty impressive number. So we feel good about where the CV balance is at the end of the first quarter. The pipeline looks strong. Our sales teams, we all feel good about the future. We don't guide on CV specifically, as you know, George. And so we're not going to provide what we think the number is going to be in Q3 or Q4, but we do feel very good about the pacing and the strength of the business that we've seen. And the other thing I'd mention is the really nice thing about the GBS growth, and both Gene and I alluded to this earlier is its real great strength across all of the major practices. And we're starting to see marketing chip in as well, which is great. So it's not just one practice that is driving the growth. We're seeing really strong growth in HR, in supply chain, in finance, in legal, in sales and with marketing starting to gain altitude as well. So we do feel good about the strength of the GBS business right now. Yes, so the margins in 2Q, based on what we're seeing from a revenue outlook perspective, will also be probably a little bit higher than normal, it will be a little bit higher than normal just based on the pacing of us making the investments and putting the money to work. And so, as we talked about, one of the big investments, obviously, is growing the sales forces. And that will happen in ramp over the balance of the year. And so, we will have some of that hit in Q2, but then it sort of compounds as we roll into Q3 and Q4. And so, I think, the Q2 margins will be higher than that normalized level that we're talking about for the second half of the year, for sure. Hey, good morning, Jeff. It's a combination of both. So the strength we saw in the first quarter or the source of the beat, if you will, was a combination of revenue strength which sticks. And also, because a lot of it was CV strength, we get to flow that through now the balance of the year combined with lightness in spending. And we are going to be increasing costs nicely and consistently over the next three quarters. That said, it's a little bit lighter than what we originally baked into our forecast just based on some of the softness we saw in Q1 and our ability to ramp up as quickly as we want to. So it is definitely a combination of the Q1 over performance and then extending that through the balance of the year, given the momentum we've seen, not only on the subscription part of the research business, but the non-subscription part of the research business, the strength we saw in bookings and backlog in the quarter allowed us to increase our consulting outlook. We increased our conferences outlook a little bit as well. So it was strength across the board. And I'd say the other big thing is, obviously, getting through the first quarter gave us a lot more visibility into not only what happened in the rearview mirror during the first quarter, but the outlook as well and the combination of all those things gave us the confidence to increase the overall outlook for the year the way you see in our updated guidance. No, please. Go ahead. You got it. Gene, yes. I'll... Good morning, Manav. Sorry. So I think a couple of things. One is, it's down year-over-year, but we've actually seen nice sequential improvement, particularly from fourth quarter into Q1. If you'll remember, Manav, the way we go to market in GBS is essentially by functional area. And so just because a client might be an HR client, we've got a team that goes in and then tries to convert the finance team and bring them honest clients. And so, we are able to generate really nice growth from existing enterprises because we may only have one function. As clients, we may have two, we may have three, we may have four, and it varies across the board. And so I think, the strength in GBS new business was a combination of new logo growth and expanding within existing client enterprises. But even, again, to understand our point, when we are expanding in client enterprises, it is often like a brand-new client, where they have gone from zero CV in finance, they become a finance client. And again, it won't increment up necessarily the client enterprise count. But again, we did see a nice sequential bump from 4Q into the first quarter and a large portion of that new business strength we saw in GBS in the first quarter could be attributed to brand-new logos. Sure, yes. So we actually converted to the at least pre pandemic. It gets associated with the it \u2013 with the pandemic, but we had actually converted to this way of guiding just prior to the pandemic. Yes, I think, we want to guide in ways that we feel that we are very confident that we will be able to achieve that guidance. And the way we've been updating our guidance each quarter over the last several quarters is we analyzed what happened in the most recent quarter. We utilized the enhanced visibility we have from a performance in that quarter and looking forward. And then we flow that through both our top line metrics and on the expense side as well. I think, in particular, we were a little cautious entering the year, particularly with thinking about the CV ramp, which drives the bulk of our \u2013 bulk of our revenue for the business. And we had a really strong first quarter from a CV ramp perspective. And the beauty of that is we had some benefit in the first quarter. But the reality is the bulk of that benefit flows through to the balance of the year as we recognize that revenue. And now we've got a view into Q2 pipeline and into Q3 pipeline as well. So we just have that advanced \u2013 enhanced visibility as well. And so again, I think, from a guidance perspective, these are numbers that, based on everything we're seeing, based on most recent performance, based on the visibility that we have around subsequent quarters or quarters that are coming up, this is what we believe the business is going to perform at. And that hasn't really changed in terms of our, I'd say, guidance philosophy or guidance methodology. So just given the volatility in the overall selling environment driven by the pandemic, driven by recessions, driven by other things. Obviously, the visibility does change or the facts that drive the visibility have been changing very rapidly quarter-to-quarter, and we've been adjusting on that each and every quarter since. And so from where we sit today, the updated guide, while it is significantly higher than what we had guided originally in the year, those are the numbers we feel very confident with."

            "name": "Gene Hall",
            "content": "Good morning and thanks for joining us. Gartner performance accelerated in the first quarter of 2021. We delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Total revenues were up 6%, with each of our business segments, research, conferences, and consulting, exceeding our expectations. Research is our largest and most profitable segment. Our research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Research has a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. For Q1, GTS contract value grew 5%. First quarter new business was up 21% as a result of new logos and up-sell with existing clients. Client engagement continued to be strong, with content and analyst interaction volumes up to 26% compared to Q1 2020. We saw strong performances across several regions and industries, including tech and midsized enterprises. We expect GTS contract value growth to continue to accelerate in 2021 and return to double-digit growth in the future. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS achieved contract value growth of 12%, its first quarter of double-digit growth. New business growth was a very strong 87% in the quarter. All practices, with the exception of marketing, ended Q1 with double-digit contract value growth rates and all practices delivered positive quarterly NCVI. Across our entire research business, we practiced relentless execution of proven practices and we are seeing the results of our efforts. Our research business is well-positioned to return to sustained double-digit growth over the medium-term. Turning to conferences, as many of you know, during 2020, our conferences business pivoted from in-person destination conferences to virtual. Our value proposition for virtual conferences remains the same as for in-person conferences. We deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. While Q1 is a small quarter for conferences, the business exceeded our expectations. Beyond virtual conferences, we continue to prepare to return to in-person conferences in the second half of 2021. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project-based work. Our Consulting segment also exceeded our expectations, with bookings up 26% during Q1. Our Consulting business will continue to serve as an important complement to our IT research business. One of our objectives is to generate strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $145 million, up significantly versus the prior year. In addition, we used that cash flow plus cash balances to purchase more than $600 million in stock through April of this year. With these repurchases, our board increased our share repurchase authorization by another $500 million. We recently launched our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report. The report details the progress we made in accelerating positive social change and contributing to a more sustainable world. We want our associates, communities and clients to continue to thrive today and in the future. The report can be found on gartner.com and I encourage you to take a look. Summarizing, Q1 was a strong quarter with all three business segments exceeding our expectations. Looking ahead, we are well-positioned for sustained success. We have a vast addressable market, which will allow us to achieve double-digit contract value and revenue growth over the next 5 years and beyond. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we will continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. And with that, I will hand the call over to Craig. Craig? Hi, Jeff. No. So, GBS has been accelerating over several quarters if you look back. And what's going on is as you said, there is a tremendous growth opportunity, the untapped market in GBS \u2013 in GTS, it's a huge untapped market. In GBS, we are even less penetrated than that. And so, the first piece of it is there is an incredibly large market opportunity. The second piece of it is that we had to get all of the elements that we know that are part of the Gartner formula lined up to fully realize that opportunity and it's things like training the sales force, we introduced a whole set of products, which the GxL products we talked about over time. And the combination of both getting our sales force up to speed on the kind of Gartner way we sell and getting all the new products introduced and making sure the sales force understood on how to sell them, that has resulted in us getting and implementing all the kind of process improvements that we've used historically and continue to improve. You pull all those things together, and that's resulted in GBS accelerating each of the quarters, as we talked about earlier. And so it's a combination of all the sort of applying subtle versions, it's applying the Gartner formula to the GBS market where we have this incredibly huge opportunity. So in a remote environment as well as in office environment, we have a great value proposition to attract sellers to Gartner. We have over time, and we continue to be \u2013 if you want to be in the selling field, Gartner is the place to be. And by the way, we have had remote salespeople for a long time, many probably \u2013 a large proportion of our field salespeople are actually deployed remotely even before the pandemic. And so we're used to working remotely there. We use the opportunity of the pandemic to look at what sales territories were most productive. And our sales headcount did go down a little bit as we looked at areas that we thought that were less productive than we could actually invest better. And if you look at our sales productivity, for 2021, we have plenty of capacity to continue to accelerate the terms of our growth for both GBS and GTS. Then going forward, as Craig said, during the year, we expect to accelerate our hiring and end the year with high single-digit growth in headcount in both GBS and GTS, which positions us really well for 2022 to continue the growth as we've done in the past. So Toni, yes, as you know, one of the important elements of growing sales productivity is the tools we provide our sales force. We've been focused on that over time. And in fact, over the last couple of years specifically, we've done a program to upgrade all of the \u2013 many of the internal systems that support sales, things like billing systems, things like that, that impact sales productivity in an indirect way because salespeople use them, even though it's not necessarily the toolings everyday. In addition to that, we are currently in the process of implementing a new CRM system, which we use by sales as well as other people throughout the business. And as we design that system, we know there are a number of opportunities to put capabilities of that system that we believe will enhance sales productivity over time. And in fact, not just sales productivity, but also help our service teams be more effective as well. Yes, Gary, great question. And I think it's actually both. I think there is clearly some pent-up demand where people want to buy our services, but the company \u2013 our clients were cautious in the past in terms of \u2013 which extended selling cycles and obviously left some pent-up demand. So I think we're certainly seeing some of that. In addition, though, to your point, every business has now figured out that they want to be \u2013 that they need to be a digital business. And so that's clearly also supporting new business growth as well. And in GBS in particular, again, I just think we \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, I've just been getting better and better at every aspect of our business. Both the products are better, the sales execution, sales support is great, the service support is great. And so I think we're getting better over time. So it's a combination of those factors. Go ahead, Craig. Go ahead. Yes, hi Andrew, it's Gene. Great question. So as we look at our sales force today, we believe we've got a lot of capacity in terms of improving our sales productivity. And so we want to make sure we capture that capacity as well and then complement that with growth. As we said, our target right now is in the high single digits this year to position us really well for next year in terms of double-digit growth. And so that's kind of our plan right now. Yes, Andrew, it's a great question. We've thought about it a lot. There is the old adage about the tough times make you stronger, I think, certainly applies to how we feel about it for us in the sense that when the pandemic hit last year it was pretty tough. And so, there were a lot of innovations we tried. We really were \u2013 had the largest set of innovative things that we tried in \u2013 I guess, in the second \u2013 beginning second quarter of last year, things like different kinds of formats for adding value remotely, things like that. And what we found is that the whole wave of innovation has resulted in some learnings. Some stuff didn't work that great. Some stuff worked really, really well, and we're going to continue that \u2013 those things going forward. So I think one learning is just that there were a bunch of specific innovations that we came up with. An example of it kind of is very clear is virtual conferences where we didn't have any virtual conferences before. It certainly begs the question going forward. We've learned to be very successful with virtual conferences. Well, when we can go back to in-person, should we continue those virtual conferences as well, which we almost certainly will in different circumstances. Similarly, with our products, we learned some ways to add value remotely that we hadn't used before that we will continue to use going forward. We also learned that we need less travel \u2013 as Craig said earlier, we'd probably need less travel than we thought we did before the pandemic. We also \u2013 we've always had a large \u2013 a relatively large share of our workforce working remotely, but for the pandemic, where everybody working remotely. So again, we developed new work practices that will, I think, improve our productivity going forward for all of our remote workers, even when some of our workers are back in the office. So those are some examples of some of the learnings that we've had from the \u2013 this time we've gone through this pandemic time. Yes, I mean, basically \u2013 go ahead, Craig. Yes, so the \u2013 what I'd say is, the \u2013 we did well around the world. The U.S. was stronger than some other markets, and there are some markets, like you can imagine, India, which isn't big for us, but didn't grow as well. Europe didn't grow as fast as the U.S. So you think about kind of \u2013 it correlates pretty closely to how the pandemic is doing around the world. So, Manav, are you asking about \u2013 just to clarify, are you asking about what's happened with the growth in the number of clients? Yes. So \u2013 yes, go ahead. So great question, John. I mean the \u2013 we have two levels that were under-penetrated. One is just the number of enterprises that we have. As we talked about before, we have more than 100,000 enterprises that we target today. And so we have a large number of enterprises we can go after. And then secondly then, within each enterprise, we have a lot of opportunity for additional seats. And it's a little different with GTS and GBS. With GTS, if you think about it as being within the technology organizations, those are large organizations, they are growing. And even among our existing clients, there is tremendous growth opportunities, we have products for, obviously, the C level, their direct reports and then on down through to their organization. And then if you look at GBS, then you have each of the functions, as Craig mentioned earlier, finance, marketing, sales, legal, etcetera. And each of those functions today, we have very, very low penetration in both enterprises, and we still have the same opportunity to add seats for each of those organizations as well. And many of those organizations are quite large, like you think about the sales organization, for example, our finance organization. There is just enormous opportunities there. And so the \u2013 whether it's GTS or GBS, we have huge opportunities, both for additional enterprises, but also for individual seats within those enterprises, both directly reporting \u2013 the C level \u2013 reporting the C level and then throughout the organization. So what I'd say is the selling environment improved throughout the quarter. In particular, I think, selling cycles became shorter throughout the quarter. And what most clients would say is that they got more visibility in terms of their own operations. And so knew better what kind of money \u2013 budget money they had and so I would sort of say the selling arm got better throughout the quarter. So summarizing today's call, Q1 was a strong quarter. We stated expectations across all three of our business segments: Research, Conferences, and Consulting. GBS delivered its first quarter of double-digit growth. And across GTS and GBS, we had very strong new business growth. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for success, for sustained success. And we have a vast addressable market, which will allow us to achieve double-digit contract value and revenue growth over the next 5 years and beyond. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we will continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nGene Hall: Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove a strong performance in the fourth quarter with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS. We generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow and we returned even more than that to shareholders through our ongoing share repurchase program. Enterprise leaders are dealing with high volatility and uncertainty. Inflation accelerated to the highest level in 40-years. The dollar was the strongest it's been in 20-years and it remains extremely volatile. There are ongoing supply chain issues, energy prices has been volatile. The labor market has been volatile. Enterprises are assessing the impact of remote versus hybrid versus in-person work. There are widespread concerns of a recession. All of these factors and more impact enterprises around the world. Leaders need help navigating this turbulent time and they know Gartner is the best source for that help. Our services often make the difference between success and failure for executives and their enterprises. We help clients succeed with their mission critical priorities, whether they're in growth mode or cutting costs. With all this volatility, our most recent research shows that Chief Financial Officers are more carefully scrutinizing expenses. But at the same time, they're increasing investment and mission critical priorities. Even in enterprises, they are under extreme financial pressure. Our research business continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. We help leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is fast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever. Research revenue grew 13% in the fourth quarter. Total contract value growth was 12%. Contract value growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. We serve the executives and their teams through two distinct sales channels: global technology sales or GTS is our largest sales force. GTS contract value grew 11%. The large majority of GTS serves IP leaders and their teams and we saw double-digit growth with this client segment despite tough compares. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs and product managers. In this segment, growth moderated, but still grew at high-single-digits, despite even tougher compares. Global Business Sales or GBS serves leaders in their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 19% in 2022. In the five years since we launched our GXL products within GBS, we've seen exceptional compound annual growth rates. Gartner conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights and engaged and qualified audience. In the first half of 2022, we delivered most of our conferences virtually. In the second half, we pivoted back to in-person for nearly all our conferences. Feedback has been excellent. Most in-person conferences were sold out in 2022 and we've sold significantly more than half of our exhibitor space for 2023. Gartner consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 24% in the fourth quarter. We exited the year with a strong backlog and pipeline. Our business is fueled by our highly talented associates. During 2022, we grew our team by about 2,900 associates. With this growth, we ended 2022 with the lowest percentage of open positions ever. When we're fully staffed, we provide our clients better service, which results in better retention. We also sell more in territories that are fully staffed. We have carefully aligned our hiring with recent demand and the long-term opportunity we have for growth. Our 2023 outlook reflects our most recent experiences from Q4. We've also been prudent in considering the potential impact of volatility from the global environment. We expect to deliver at least 21.5% margins across a wide range of economic scenarios. And our guidance has opportunity for upside if the business performs in line with historical trends. Craig will take you through our guidance in more detail. One of the unique things about Gartner is that we provide value to enterprises that are thriving, shortly or anywhere in between. By being exceptionally agile and adapting to the changing world, we have sustained record of success. We're well prepared as we enter 2023. We've carefully aligned staffing levels with demand and we have the lowest percentage of open positions ever. Our content addresses today's mission critical priorities. And we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. In closing, we again saw strong growth across the business. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to drive growth far into the future. Even as we invest for future growth, we expect margins to increase modestly over time and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income or return capital to our shareholders through buybacks, which reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Fourth quarter results were strong with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. FX neutral growth was even stronger than our reported results. We also delivered better than planned EBITDA margins. During 2022, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow and we returned more than that to shareholders through stock repurchases. Our financial performance for the full-year 2022 included total contract value growth of 12%, total revenue growth of 16%, EBITDA growth of 14%, diluted adjusted EPS of $11.27, and free cash flow of $993 million. We are introducing 2023 guidance, which reflects higher than normal variability in the set of reasonably likely outcomes. The guidance accounts for the tough compares at the start of the year and the opportunity for upside if near-term demand is stronger than we built into the outlook. With the catch up hiring we did last year; we are very well positioned to add value to enterprise function leaders and their teams across all industries and around the world. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year as reported and 20% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, down 100 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $421 million, up 37% year-over-year and up 44% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $3.70, up 24% and free cash flow in the quarter was $166 million. We finished the year with 19,505 associates, up 18% from the end of 2021. About 40% of the headcount growth was catch up from prior years. Our hiring has been carefully calibrated to revenue growth and future demand and we are well positioned from a talent perspective heading into 2023. Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 9% year-over-year as reported and 13% on an FX neutral basis driven by our strong contract value growth. Fourth quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with 2021. The contribution margin had a benefit during the quarter from somewhat lower headcount levels and travel expenses still modestly below our post-pandemic expectations. For the full-year 2022, research revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and 16% FX neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74% in line with 2021. Contract value or CV represents the annualized revenue under contract at a point in time. In looking at our global contract value across both GTS and GBS, more than 75% of our CV is from enterprise function leaders and their teams with the bulk of the balance coming from leaders at tech vendors. Our enterprise function leader\u2019s business includes IT leaders, who are end users of technology and who we serve through our GTS sales force. And leaders of other business functions who we serve through our GBS sales force. In both cases, we serve leaders around the world and across all industries. We're helping these enterprise function leaders address their most important mission critical priorities. CV was $4.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 11.9% versus the prior year and up 12.3% adjusted for the impact of exiting Russia. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at strong double-digit rates. CV from tech vendors grew high-single-digits, compared to a high-teens growth rate in the fourth quarter of \u201821. Quarterly net contract value increase or NCVI was $189 million [Technical Difficulty] business of almost $400 million. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, all industry sectors grew at double-digit rates other than technology and media, which grew at high-single-digit rates. The fastest growth was in the transportation, retail and manufacturing sectors. We had double-digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories. We also drove double-digit growth in nine of our top 10 countries, with high-single-digit growth in the 10. Global technology sales CV was $3.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 10% versus prior year and up 10.5% adjusted for the exit of Russia. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $138 million, while retention for GTS was 105% for the quarter. GTS new business was down 8.5% versus last year. New business with IT function leaders was up modestly year-over-year against a tough compare. New business with tech vendors facing even tougher compare against Q4 of 2021, which was its strongest quarter ever. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 18%, compared to December of last year, about 40% of the growth was catch up hiring from 2021. Our continued investments in our sales teams will drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global business sales CV was over $1 billion at the end of fourth quarter, up 19% year-over-year, which is above the high-end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. All of our GBS practices other than marketing grew at double-digit growth rates led by supply chain and HR, which both continued to grow faster than 20%. GBS CV increased $52 million from the third quarter, while retention for GBS was 112%. GBS new business was up 3% versus last year against a very strong compare. The two-year compound annual growth rate for new business was 9%. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased 22% year-over-year with a little more than 50% of the growth being catch up from 2021. Headcount we hired in 2022 will help to position us for sustained double-digit growth in the future. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $188 million, contribution margin in the quarter was 53%, we held nine in-person conferences in the quarter. It has been very exciting for our business to return to in-person conferences. For the full year 2022, revenue increased 82% on a reported basis and 90% FX neutral. Gross contribution margin was 54%. Fourth quarter consulting revenues increased by 17% year-over-year to $138 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 24%. Consulting contribution margin was 37% in the fourth quarter. Labor based revenues were $96 million, up 11% versus Q4 of last year and up 19% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at December 31 was $140 million, increasing 24% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with another strong bookings quarter. The inclusion of multi-year contracts in our backlog calculation a change we described earlier last year, contributed about 13 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate. Our contract optimization business had a very strong quarter increasing 36 % as reported and 39% on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. Full-year consulting revenue was up 15% on a reported basis and 22% on an FX neutral basis. Gross contribution margin of 39% was up 140 basis points from 2021. Consolidated cost of services increased 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 24% on an FX neutral basis. The biggest drivers of the increase were higher headcount to support our continued strong growth and the return to in-person destination conferences. SG&A decreased 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and increased 1% on an FX neutral basis. We had lower non-cash non-recurring charges in 2022, compared to 2021. On a comparable basis, SG&A was up due to additional headcount for sales and G&A functions. For the full -year, cost of services increased 17% on a reported basis and 21% on an FX neutral basis. SG&A increased 15% on a reported basis and 19% on an FX neutral basis in 2022. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $421 million, up 37% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 44% FX neutral. Fourth quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our forecasts, most notably in consulting and expenses at the low-end of our expectations. EBITDA for the full-year was $1.47 billion, 14% increase over 2021 on a reported basis and up 19% FX neutral. Depreciation was $24 million in the fourth quarter, down modestly versus 2021. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $29 million about flat with the prior year. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 16.7% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 23.2% for the quarter. The full-year tax rate was 21.6% on the same basis. Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $3.70, up 19% year-over-year. The average share count for the fourth quarter was 80 million shares. This is a reduction of about 3.7 million shares or about 4% year-over-year. We exited the fourth quarter with about 80 million shares outstanding on an unweighted basis. For the full-year, adjusted EPS was $11.27, EPS growth for the year was 22%. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $203 million, excluding insurance proceeds in Q4 of 2021, operating cash flow was down about 7%. Q4 cash flow was impacted by Hurricane Ian, which hit our center of excellence in Fort Myers extremely hard in late September. While we were able to sell and service our clients from Fort Myers, we did have some delays in getting invoices out as quickly as we normally would. Elections for some of these delayed invoices slipped into January, but we are now caught up. CapEx for the quarter was $38 million, up about $16 million year-over-year, led by increases in capitalized technology labor costs and catch-up laptop spend. Free cash flow for the quarter was $166 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. As many of you know, we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income. Our conversion from EBITDA is also very strong. With the differences being cash interest, cash taxes and modest CapEx, partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 18% on a rolling fourth quarter basis. On the same basis, free cash flow was 68% of EBITDA and 123% of GAAP net income. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had almost $700 million of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing-12-month EBITDA was under 2 times. Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases, and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.7 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased more than $1 billion of stock throughout 2022. We expect the Board will refresh our share repurchase authorization as needed, which they did earlier this month. We now have about $1 billion authorized for share repurchases. Across the past two years, we have returned $2.7 billion to shareholders by repurchasing more than 11 million shares. Over that timeframe, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 11%. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. Before providing the 2023 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2023. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. Our plan allows for a higher-than-normal level of uncertainty in the world as Gene discussed. We've got tough compares across the business and particularly with tech vendors for another quarter or two. We've taken a prudent approach based on historical trends, as well as more normal patterns which we reflected in the guidance. If near-term demand is stronger than we've built into the outlook and NCVI phasing, retention rates, and non-subscription growth performed closer to the way they have historically, there would be upside to our guidance. In addition, our teams are focused on driving greater growth than what's embedded in the guidance. Finally, as you think about GBS overall CV and revenue growth for 2023, please keep in mind that we closed on the divestiture of a small non-core asset last week. We sold Talentneuron which we acquired as part of the CEB transaction for $164 million. In the earnings supplement appendix, we've provided historical contract value updated for 2023 FX rates, as well as the removal of Talentneuron from prior years. For conferences, we are basing our guidance on being 100% in-person for the 47 destination conferences we have planned for 2023. We expect to return to more typical seasonality for the business with fourth quarter the largest followed by the second quarter. For consulting revenues, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization is seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. We had a very strong year in 2022, especially in contract optimization in the fourth quarter. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect significant headcount increases from 2022 annualizing into 2023. Our plan for headcount for 2023 is more in line with our normal model as we caught up on hiring last year. If demand is stronger than what's in the initial plan, we will have opportunity to add even more great talent to our teams. We also expect T&E cost to more fully normalize this year. Finally, we continue to invest in our systems and process automation, both client facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. We will continue both to manage expenses prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins. At current rates, FX will be a modest tailwind to growth for the full-year with the benefit in the second half. Our guidance for 2023 is as follows: we expect research revenue of at least $4.92 billion, which is growth of about 7%. Excluding the effect of the divest adds 1 percentage point to the year-over-year growth rate. We expect conferences revenue of at least $445 million, which is growth of about 14%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $500 million, which is growth of about 4%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.865 billion, which is growth of about 7%. Excluding the divested business from 2022 would add about 80 basis points to the growth rate. As I've mentioned, we've taken a prudent approach to planning for 2023. This applies to revenue, operating expenses and free cash flow. We expect full-year EBITDA of at least $1.26 billion. We expect to be able to deliver at least 21.5% margins in most economic scenarios. If revenue is stronger than our guidance, we expect upside to EBITDA and margins. Included in the guidance is equity comp of $132 million, up from 2022. We expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $8.80 per share. For 2023, we expect free cash flow of at least $920 million. Our EPS guidance is based on 80 million shares, which only assumes repurchases to offset dilution. Finally, for the first quarter of 2023, we expect to deliver at least $310 million of EBITDA. All the details of our full-year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Our strong performance in 2022 continued in the fourth quarter. Contract value grew 12%, adjusted EPS increased 195, fueled in part by the significant reduction of shares in 2021 and 2022. Over the past few years, our hiring has been carefully calibrated to demand and we are well positioned from a top perspective heading into 2023. Our continued investments in our teams will drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. We repurchased more than $1 billion in stock last year and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time. As I mentioned, we expect to generate at least $920 million in free cash flow in 2023. In addition, we have ample liquidity and the net proceeds from last week's divestiture for capital deployment initiatives. Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA, because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. Maybe if you could talk through what you think for the outlook for the tech vendor channel? Just given the more recent risks and a need to cycle through kind of renewals on annual and multi-year contracts? And related to that, is there an opportunity or a plan to reallocate some of those sales resources into, kind of, the functional leader channels?\nGene Hall: Hey, Jeff. It's Gene, I'll get started. So as we think about the tech vendor channel, I'm going to start with tech industry itself, the technology companies. And we think that those as being in two different segments: One, is sort of enterprise IT and the other is consumer and devices, things like that. On the enterprise IT, we're expecting the technology companies -- technology vendors to grow about 7.8% globally during \u201823. And the reason they're growing pretty robustly is that enterprise IT spending that's the ones that are not certainly consumers is selling to large complex B2B sales and they tend to be multi-year contracts and annual increases, et cetera. So that's the technology vendors that are selling to enterprise IT. They're also seeing continued demand for cloud, security, digital modernization. And so all those things are growing at a much higher rate than the general tech industry. And when we survey CEOs, that CEO's this is a end users, their customers, they're buying the speed of the equipment. Their business is saying things, I believe digital modernization is still really important to meet the economic situation, as well as staffing situations they face, as well as consumer requirements for more technology and services they offer. So on the enterprise IT, just summarizing the enterprise IT, tech vendors, we have to see that growing about 7.8% globally at \u201923. On the consumer device side, that's going to be a lot worse in the sense that we expect demand to be lower there. And that's because a lot of demand was pulled forward during the recession and during the pandemic. And so there's sort of a tale of two cities in the tech industry. So that's the tech vendors themselves, our business is predominantly on the enterprise IT side. We just proportionally serve those. So looking forward, we expect actually to check vendors that we serve to be doing okay as opposed to the consumer and device manufacturers, which we expect actually to shrink during 2023. And so that translates into our own business we expect -- we had a -- as Craig [Indiscernible] results, our vendor, our sales force that sells to technology vendors actually went from very high teens growth. I'm sorry, that's a high teens growth to low-single-digit growth. So they actually -- I\u2019m sorry in high-single-digit growth. So they actually performed pretty well in the fourth quarter. Going forward again because our major business is selling to the enterprise IT technology vendors, we expect that business to do pretty well on a go forward basis.\nCraig Safian: And Jeff, the last part of your question on the territory assignment and where we're putting our growth, we've got a pretty robust territory optimization and analytics team that is always looking at this and we have the ability to very quickly and with a lot of agility flex up or down on where we're putting those territories. And so obviously as we're looking at our selling environment and the growth of the business, we're continuing to allocate those resources accordingly. And then the last thing, I mentioned and you sort of had this buried in your question, but I'll pull it out, is our business selling to the enterprise functions, both in IT and outside of IT through GBS performed very, very well in Q4 and for the full-year. And it was really the tech vendors that had, as Gene said, a very tough compare going from high-teens growth to high-single-digit growth in the quarter.\nJeff Meuler: Appreciate that. And maybe just a follow-up, given that comment on the strength selling to the functional leader channel. Productivity metrics, I understand, kind of, the way the metric works and the year-over-year acceleration in sales headcount growth, but productivity was down and quarterly productivity was also quite a bit down year-over-year. Can you just kind of like tease out 10-year mix impacts? I don't know if there's anything on -- anything further to say at the tech vendor channel, but just kind of like help us bridge that because it does look pretty soft. Thank you.\nGene Hall: Yes. So Jeff, I mean, again, the way to kind of think about the results in quarter and if you look at it on a rolling four quarter basis, is again that the end user side of the GTS business held up really, really well. And performed really well throughout the year and in the fourth quarter, including the productivity. And again just we saw that deceleration from high-teens to high-single-digits, obviously impacting the productivity as well. I think as we have brought in more and more new associates and the sales force. Last year, we talked about in 2021 rather, we had the best tender mix we've ever had. In 2022, we had really the highest proportion of new people we've ever had that's obviously going to impact productivity. We'll start to see the benefits of the tenuring over the course of 2023 as all of those people we hired over the course of 2022 start getting up the productivity curves.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I guess, first off, you've communicated a fair amount during the call that you're taking a prudent approach to guidance. And I know you just addressed the tech center piece of the business, but I'm curious if you can elaborate a little bit in terms of how you're thinking about the overall macro environment in your guide, especially on the research side? And then as well for conferences and consulting, because it seems like the guide for those parts of the business imply the economy holds up pretty well. So just want to kind of get your deeper into your train of thought? Thanks.\nCraig Safian: Sure. Good morning, Heather, and thanks for the questions. So I think a couple of thoughts there. So I'll start with conferences and consulting first. And so as we look at those two businesses, again, coming off of very strong 2022, if you look at the backlog position in consulting, we actually entered the year in really good shape. We had a very strong delivery quarter in the fourth quarter, but also a very strong bookings quarter. And again, based on the visibility that we have, roughly through the first half of the year, we feel really good about the consulting business and the trending looks good there. And again, I think our client base to Gene\u2019s earlier comments about the tech sector, are still embarking on a lot of -- embarking or continuing on a lot of digital transformation and major tech projects and programs where our consulting team really can't help them get the most value out of that. On the conferences side, again, we had a great year of returning to in-person conferences in 2022 and the team has done a fantastic job of driving forward, what we call, forward bookings, but basically locking up the revenue from the exhibitor side into 2023, and so as Gene mentioned, we've got significantly more than 50% of our pre bookings already under contract. As we head into 2023, and so feel very, very good about the conferences business as well. On the research side, again, our enterprise function leader business is performing very well and we expect that to continue to perform well. We do have -- continue to have tough compares there, but we do -- we're driving great value for our clients and we expect that to continue. We have been thoughtful and prudent about our experience in the fourth quarter with our tech vendor clients and making sure that we don't assume just some magical return to high-teens growth right out of the gate. And so we're trying to be prudent by making sure we use our most recent experience, enrolling that through the four quarters from a research perspective. But again, end user enterprise function leader business again performing very strong, nice double-digit growth rates. The tech vendor business still at high-single-digits. Just down from where we were a year ago.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. And as a follow-up question, sort of, a follow-up on the last -- the earlier question with regards to the new associates and the hiring you've done, you're going into a potentially tougher environment in 2023. And you have a kind of a relatively young sales force. How are you preparing your teams for this environment and thoughts around ability to attract new customers in this environment with sort of associates who are, say, one-year in?\nGene Hall : Hey, Heather, it's Gene. So we always train our associates on what are the most important mission critical priorities with our clients and prospects today. One of the issues that's going to be on people's minds in some industries is going to be cost reduction. And so we train our salespeople on, among other things how to help clients with cost reduction. We're a very small proportion of cost for any client. They can't -- they're not going to save a lot of money by cutting our services. On the other hand, we can help them save a whole number of multiples of what they pay for us in their actual ongoing business. In addition to that, as I mentioned earlier, most companies, even in a tough environment [Indiscernible] they want to invest in technology and it's on things, like automation that helps with their own labor situation, their own labor costs, [Indiscernible] other kinds of costs. And again, the continuing transition to more and more digital services that are often in just about every single industry. So we train our new salespeople on both how to sell to clients that value proposition, which is the continuing transition to digital, but also how to save money on their IT purchases, so that they actually get -- they could be more efficient over time. So the combination of those things, and of course, our traditional selling skills where we -- I think, are quite good at training new salespeople in terms of how to sell effectively, you put those things together and it lets new salespeople -- they're not as productive as experienced salespeople, but they're actually quite good in the broad context.\nHeather Balsky: Alright. Thank you for the help.\nOperato: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks, so much. Wanted to start out on the margins. Margins in the quarter, really exceptionally strong again. And obviously, the guide being 21.5% next year. You've had about 2.5 quarters, let's say, of this sort of higher sales headcount level. I guess, are you fully back on T&E? What's really going to drive the margins to that sort of low 20s level?\nCraig Safian: Good morning, Toni. Yes, I mean, the way to think about the bridge from 2022 to 2023 is consistent with the way we've been talking about it for the last several quarters. And so, the biggest piece of it is the annualization of all the hiring we did in 2022 and obviously, paying the full load for all those new associates over the course of 2023. So that's by far the biggest piece of it. A lot of our hiring was back-end loaded or second-half loaded, I should say. And so, obviously, there's a pretty significant uplift in the annual cost as we annualize all of those individuals. There's an element of T&E, to your point. And so, we're -- fourth quarter was kind of in line with where we expected to be. But obviously, the first part of 2022, we were still mostly in lockdown and not traveling. And so, there are incremental T&E expense that we expect in 2023, as we get to kind of the new normal of travel post-pandemic. And there's a few other nits here and there, but the two primary ones are really the annualization of the headcount and a little bit more on the T&E side.\nToni Kaplan: Okay. Great. And wanted to ask about free cash flow. I know you mentioned a couple of things in the prepared remarks, but maybe just talk about why the free cash flow came in below the guidance and then the \u201823 guidance also looked a little bit lighter than I was thinking? So any puts and takes on free cash flow would be helpful. Thanks.\nCraig Safian: Yes, absolutely. So in 2022, the bulk of the story is, what, I discussed in my prepared remarks, which is just some invoicing delays coming out as a result of the Hurricane. And we thought we would be able to get all caught up on that in 2022 and a bunch of it did slip into 2023. And actually, through the end of January, we actually are all caught up on that. So we feel good about both the \u201822 finish and getting that all behind us. In terms of 2023, obviously, there can be a lot of variability to the free cash flow numbers. If you look at it on the surface from the guidance, the free cash flow margin is in line with what we'd expect free cash flow as a percent of EBITDA is roughly where we'd expect and the free cash flow conversion as a percent of GAAP net income is in the range as well. And so, I think the free cash flow guidance and the free cash flow expectation is sort of in line with the business performance. I do think there are a couple of things impacting \u201823 that potentially put it a little bit below your expectations, probably, most notably cash taxes. So because of all that extra earnings in 2022, we have more to pay in taxes, and that's obviously reflected into 2023 free cash flow guidance as well.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one I wanted to ask was just on conferences. I think you said in your prepared remarks that there would be 47 conferences in \u201823, or at least that's what's planned at this point and all in-person. Obviously, a decent bit lower than where you were running pre-pandemic. So just looking for an update in terms of strategy there. I know you've talked about adding conferences to different functional lines over the course of the next couple of years. Where does kind of \u201823 sit relative to your ultimate goal on conferences? And is there the potential for additional destination conferences to be added as we move through the year?\nGene Hall: Yes. Hey Andrew. So the -- our strategy is to have conferences for all the major functional areas in our businesses, I think, in IT, HR, finance, et cetera, as well as within -- cybersecurity applications and so forth. And we're far from that now -- and sorry, and also each of those conferences in each of our major geographies. And so, there's a -- it will take us a long time to get to the point where we have the aspiration I just said, which is to have a conference for every major of share count in every major geographic region. And we're at -- because these conferences add so much value to our -- the attendees, our seat holders that actually go and attend these conferences, we really want to expand those as quickly as we can. We're limited by what you do operationally with how fast we can actually hire people and build these conferences. And so, we're going to continue on that path. We did that -- we've had as an as we think we can handle operationally in 2023. If we find during the year, we can have more, we will do that. And certainly, in \u201824, \u201825, \u201826, we expect to have a continuing expansion of these conferences, again, because of the very high value they provide to our attendees, our seat holders and also our prospects.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, switching gears a little bit. I just wanted to ask more specifically about growth in GBS. You talked about some of the things that have, kind of, evolved outside of the functional leader channel in GTS. But can you speak to the different businesses within GBS, how conversations with clients have evolved over the past couple of months there? And if there's any individual businesses there to call out either positively or negatively relative to last quarter? Thank you.\nGene Hall: Yes. We had great performance in GBS during 2022, including the fourth quarter. There's tremendous opportunity in GBS. As with the rest of our business, really grow GBS as quickly as we can to capture that enormous opportunity. We had growth in -- across all functional areas, very robust growth, actually. And the areas that were slower, it was more internal operational things that we had. So for example, we might have had one area where we were a little slow in hiring than another area. And so, the places that GBS was a little slower, we believe are more due to more internal operational things that we're working on. But again, the overall performance was very strong, we're very happy with that performance.\nCraig Safian: Yes. And Andrew, just to underscore that, I mean, 18.9% growth for the full-year coming off of a 24% full-year growth in 2021 is really, really strong, continued consistent growth. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, both supply chain and HR were well above 20% year-over-year growth again, coming off of really strong years in 2021 as well. And so, really strong demand there. It's indicative of the fact that across all of GBS, we are providing enormous value to the functional leaders that we serve in finance, HR, supply chain, marketing, sales, legal and so on.\nAndrew Nicholas: Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nSeth Weber: Hey, good morning, guys. Gene, in an answer to one of the prior questions, you mentioned customers looking to manage costs better. I'm wondering if you're getting any pushback on pricing, less appetite for multiyear contracts? Or can you just talk about the pricing environment and how perceptive customers are? And what you think that might look like in an environment where inflation starts to come down? Thanks.\nGene Hall: Yes. So we've had larger-than-usual price increases over the recent past, because of accelerated inflation. And we've had, I'd say, essentially zero pushback from our clients on it. And if you look at the cost of Gartner for an individual user or for even a contract for the company, it's a small ticket item. And whether it increases 3% or 7% isn't a swing factor. The swing factor is the value we provide. And we provide a tremendous better value to these clients for the costs that they have to pay, spend any alternative and can provide some credible value. So we have had, I'd say, kind of, no measurable pushback on our price increases, even though they're at higher rates.\nSeth Weber: Okay. And is there still appetite for multiyear contracts? Or is that changed \u2026\nGene Hall: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. In fact, again, the -- many of our clients prefer multi-year contracts. It's a small ticket item and they have administrative costs in dealing with it. And so, many, if not most of our clients actually prefer multi-years, because the procurement people don't want to waste their time doing this over and over again. And so, to actually see demand from our clients for multi-years as opposed to the other way around.\nCraig Safian: Yes. And on top of that, obviously, their mission-critical priorities are not founded by a contractual term. And so, they want to make sure that they have support and insight to support their mission-critical priorities. And so, we've seen no pushback at all on our ability to sell multiyear contracts.\nSeth Weber: Okay. And then Craig, you mentioned the 50% sign-up prebooking for the conference business. Can you just -- how does that compare to pre-COVID levels for this time of the year?\nCraig Safian: Yes, it's a great question. So actually, significantly greater than 50% is actually the -- what both Gene and I said, we're actually comparable or perhaps even a little bit stronger than we were pre-pandemic on that metric.\nQ - Seth Webe: Perfect. Okay, thank you very much guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You mentioned headcount growth in 2023 for Research will be more in line with the normal model. Can you discuss how hiring is progressing in GTS and GBS given the tight labor market? And what level of headcount growth do you think will be achievable this year?\nA - Gene Hal: Hey, George. So the -- our -- we are a very attractive employer in the marketplace. When we go for talent, we're a place that people want to work. And we -- it's a -- we're actually a tough place to drive into reverse selective as well. We've had no trouble hiring at all, which is why our growth rate in our associate body has accelerated so much as I talked about in my remarks. So again, we're an attractive place to work, people going want to work here. And so, they have a great associate value proposition, so we don't have any trouble hiring people.\nCraig Safian: And I think, George, the way to think about just building on Gene's comments, we've -- in \u201821 and \u201822, we invested to rebuild our recruiting function and recruiting capacity. And we have that now available rolling forward. As Gene mentioned, we have a great selling brand and associate brand more broadly for those recruiters to go out and attract people. As we think about the headcount growth for this year, it is more in line with our kind of \u201cnormal algorithm\u201d where we expect to grow headcount 4 points to 5 points lower than CV growth. That being said, given the recruitment capacity we have and given our standing in the market, if we see our CV growth accelerating, it gives us the opportunity to potentially go a little bit faster there. And if we see challenges with the business, we can easily tap the breaks and slow down. So we've built a plan that we feel real comfortable with that is in line with our normal -- or our go-forward model, but also allows us the flexibility to flex up or flex down given on what we're seeing from a demand perspective.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, you're guiding to at least 21.5% EBITDA margins in 2023. Under what conditions could you outperform the 21.5% target?\nCraig Safian: Yes. I mean, I think that the major way would be from revenue upside. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've taken a prudent approach on the revenue, on the expenses and on the free cash flow. And if revenue does come in stronger, we would anticipate potential upside to the margins, that's probably the primary way that we see it. We are, again, making sure that we are calibrating all of our expenses most notably headcount, but all of our expenses with what we're seeing from a revenue perspective. And we're making sure that we're also seeing the right investments so that we can sustain growth into the future and also deliver really, really strong margins. And so, we feel like we've got the balance right now. We're obviously -- our structural margins are significantly higher than they were pre-pandemic. And as we talk about, we believe we could modestly expand margins on a year-over-year-over-year basis moving forward.\nGeorge Tong: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. You mentioned the divestiture of the Talentneuron business. Can we get a little bit more color on that? It looks like you own that business for about five or six years. What did it do? Why we sell it now? And should we expect any other kind of divestitures?\nGene Hall: Hi, Jeff. So Talentneuron is a business that provides data -- labor market data, principally to people that -- in companies, that are doing long-term planning for where companies should have their workforce. And we've got the business when we bought CEB. It was an acquisition CEB had done. When we bought CEB, therefore, we acquired that business. As we looked at it, we've been looking at the business to see does it really fit with our business on a go-forward basis, and it is strategic to us. We've looked at it in a lot of depth. We've looked for innovative ways we could use it. And at the end of the day, we decided that it was not a strategic bet that were better owners for that business than us, which is why we divested it. Let\u2019s just focus on the -- our core business in HR, which that was not really related to. In terms of other divestitures, again, if we see things that don't fit our core business, we would divest them. We'll discuss those when it's appropriate.\nJeff Silber: All right. Great. Sorry, I got the name mixed up with Jimmy Neutron. In terms of my follow-up, nothing mid take here, you provided a tremendous amount of data. But in looking at wallet retention, it did decline slightly year-over-year. Is there anything to read into it? Are you giving pricing concessions or people pushing back on reordering, et cetera?\nCraig Safian: Jeff, I won't comment on your Jimmy Neutron comment. We'll save that for later. In terms of wallet retention, again, I think it's consistent with the way we talked about all of the GTS business earlier and the overall research business as well. Our enterprise function leader business performed very, very well across GBS and GTS. And essentially, what you're seeing in the wild is just that deceleration of the tech vendor business from high teens growth to single-digit growth. Even with that, it's still really strong at 105%, obviously, well above 100% and significantly in excess of client retention. And so, the core value is still there. But the slight deceleration or variance on a year-over-year basis can be completely attributed to the tech center business. And again, I underscore the enterprise function business in both GTS and GBS performed very well in the fourth quarter.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify on the tech lender side again. I think you said it was a quarter of your business. It grew high-single-digits. And did I hear you say that even for \u201823, you assume it's going to be growing high-single-digits? I was just curious if that decel was due to churn or new business and how that's going to come basically?\nCraig Safian: Hey, good morning, Manav. So we didn't talk about the expectation from a CV growth perspective. For any part of the business, we don't provide CV guidance or anything like that. I think, again, it's -- as we built the plan and our guidance for 2023, we've utilized what we saw in the fourth quarter in terms of retention metrics, new business metrics and productivity metrics and things of that nature as some of the inputs to extrapolate out our expectation for 2023. I think on the tech vendor side, in particular, obviously, there's a lot going on in that industry right now. We're still selling through it. High-single-digit growth is still pretty nice growth, just not high-teens growth. And so, we believe that given the value proposition that we have for even leaders in that space, that we've got a great value proposition and a great set of products, and we'll continue to serve those clients and help them with their mission-critical priorities in the same way that we help the enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. And then just on the sales -- the question around the sales force growth. You said 4 points to 5 points below CV. I guess -- and I think you said lowest level of open position. So does that mean this year's growth is going to be less than the kind of -- maybe even much less than the kind of 10% we were used to historically?\nCraig Safian: Yes. So we recalibrated the way that we were going to grow the sales force back in 2019. And essentially, the model -- obviously, 2022 is different, because we had to do a lot of catch up. But our model moving forward is we want to essentially not dilute our overall cost of sale. And the way we do that is grow the sales headcount, call it, 4 points to 5 points depending on wage inflation, slower than CV growth. That's our stated model moving forward. And so, that's what we've got in place for 2023. And so, yes, it will not be 10% to 15% headcount growth unless we see 15% to 20% CV growth. And again, as I mentioned, during George's question, we believe we are set up to speed up or slow down accordingly as needed. And so, if we see CV growth start to accelerate, we have the recruitment capacity to be able to increase that. And if we see CV growth slowing, we obviously can tap the brakes as well. So we feel like we're in a really, really good place from a talent perspective. We are, as we both mentioned, Gene and I carefully calibrating headcount growth and expenses. And we feel like we've struck the right balance between making sure we're investing for future growth and delivering strong margin performance.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Gene Hall for any closing remarks.\nGene Hall: Here's what I'd like you to take away from today's call. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we again saw strong growth across the business. Gartner delivers incredible value to enterprises that are thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. By being exceptionally agile and adaptive to a changing world, we've delivered a sustained record of success. We're well prepared as we enter 2023. We've carefully aligned staffing levels with demand and with the lowest percentage of open positions ever. Our content is today's mission-critical priorities. And we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to drive growth far into the future. And even as we invest for future growth, we expect margin to increase modestly over time. We generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. We'll return capital to our shareholders through buybacks, which reduced shares outstanding and increases returns over time. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Fourth quarter results were strong with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. FX neutral growth was even stronger than our reported results. We also delivered better than planned EBITDA margins. During 2022, we generated almost $1 billion of free cash flow and we returned more than that to shareholders through stock repurchases. Our financial performance for the full-year 2022 included total contract value growth of 12%, total revenue growth of 16%, EBITDA growth of 14%, diluted adjusted EPS of $11.27, and free cash flow of $993 million. We are introducing 2023 guidance, which reflects higher than normal variability in the set of reasonably likely outcomes. The guidance accounts for the tough compares at the start of the year and the opportunity for upside if near-term demand is stronger than we built into the outlook. With the catch up hiring we did last year; we are very well positioned to add value to enterprise function leaders and their teams across all industries and around the world. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year as reported and 20% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, down 100 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $421 million, up 37% year-over-year and up 44% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $3.70, up 24% and free cash flow in the quarter was $166 million. We finished the year with 19,505 associates, up 18% from the end of 2021. About 40% of the headcount growth was catch up from prior years. Our hiring has been carefully calibrated to revenue growth and future demand and we are well positioned from a talent perspective heading into 2023. Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 9% year-over-year as reported and 13% on an FX neutral basis driven by our strong contract value growth. Fourth quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with 2021. The contribution margin had a benefit during the quarter from somewhat lower headcount levels and travel expenses still modestly below our post-pandemic expectations. For the full-year 2022, research revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and 16% FX neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74% in line with 2021. Contract value or CV represents the annualized revenue under contract at a point in time. In looking at our global contract value across both GTS and GBS, more than 75% of our CV is from enterprise function leaders and their teams with the bulk of the balance coming from leaders at tech vendors. Our enterprise function leader's business includes IT leaders, who are end users of technology and who we serve through our GTS sales force. And leaders of other business functions who we serve through our GBS sales force. In both cases, we serve leaders around the world and across all industries. We're helping these enterprise function leaders address their most important mission critical priorities. CV was $4.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 11.9% versus the prior year and up 12.3% adjusted for the impact of exiting Russia. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at strong double-digit rates. CV from tech vendors grew high-single-digits, compared to a high-teens growth rate in the fourth quarter of \u201821. Quarterly net contract value increase or NCVI was $189 million [Technical Difficulty] business of almost $400 million. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, all industry sectors grew at double-digit rates other than technology and media, which grew at high-single-digit rates. The fastest growth was in the transportation, retail and manufacturing sectors. We had double-digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories. We also drove double-digit growth in nine of our top 10 countries, with high-single-digit growth in the 10. Global technology sales CV was $3.6 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 10% versus prior year and up 10.5% adjusted for the exit of Russia. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $138 million, while retention for GTS was 105% for the quarter. GTS new business was down 8.5% versus last year. New business with IT function leaders was up modestly year-over-year against a tough compare. New business with tech vendors facing even tougher compare against Q4 of 2021, which was its strongest quarter ever. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 18%, compared to December of last year, about 40% of the growth was catch up hiring from 2021. Our continued investments in our sales teams will drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global business sales CV was over $1 billion at the end of fourth quarter, up 19% year-over-year, which is above the high-end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. All of our GBS practices other than marketing grew at double-digit growth rates led by supply chain and HR, which both continued to grow faster than 20%. GBS CV increased $52 million from the third quarter, while retention for GBS was 112%. GBS new business was up 3% versus last year against a very strong compare. The two-year compound annual growth rate for new business was 9%. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased 22% year-over-year with a little more than 50% of the growth being catch up from 2021. Headcount we hired in 2022 will help to position us for sustained double-digit growth in the future. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $188 million, contribution margin in the quarter was 53%, we held nine in-person conferences in the quarter. It has been very exciting for our business to return to in-person conferences. For the full year 2022, revenue increased 82% on a reported basis and 90% FX neutral. Gross contribution margin was 54%. Fourth quarter consulting revenues increased by 17% year-over-year to $138 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 24%. Consulting contribution margin was 37% in the fourth quarter. Labor based revenues were $96 million, up 11% versus Q4 of last year and up 19% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at December 31 was $140 million, increasing 24% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with another strong bookings quarter. The inclusion of multi-year contracts in our backlog calculation a change we described earlier last year, contributed about 13 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate. Our contract optimization business had a very strong quarter increasing 36 % as reported and 39% on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. Full-year consulting revenue was up 15% on a reported basis and 22% on an FX neutral basis. Gross contribution margin of 39% was up 140 basis points from 2021. Consolidated cost of services increased 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 24% on an FX neutral basis. The biggest drivers of the increase were higher headcount to support our continued strong growth and the return to in-person destination conferences. SG&A decreased 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and increased 1% on an FX neutral basis. We had lower non-cash non-recurring charges in 2022, compared to 2021. On a comparable basis, SG&A was up due to additional headcount for sales and G&A functions. For the full -year, cost of services increased 17% on a reported basis and 21% on an FX neutral basis. SG&A increased 15% on a reported basis and 19% on an FX neutral basis in 2022. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $421 million, up 37% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 44% FX neutral. Fourth quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our forecasts, most notably in consulting and expenses at the low-end of our expectations. EBITDA for the full-year was $1.47 billion, 14% increase over 2021 on a reported basis and up 19% FX neutral. Depreciation was $24 million in the fourth quarter, down modestly versus 2021. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $29 million about flat with the prior year. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 16.7% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 23.2% for the quarter. The full-year tax rate was 21.6% on the same basis. Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $3.70, up 19% year-over-year. The average share count for the fourth quarter was 80 million shares. This is a reduction of about 3.7 million shares or about 4% year-over-year. We exited the fourth quarter with about 80 million shares outstanding on an unweighted basis. For the full-year, adjusted EPS was $11.27, EPS growth for the year was 22%. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $203 million, excluding insurance proceeds in Q4 of 2021, operating cash flow was down about 7%. Q4 cash flow was impacted by Hurricane Ian, which hit our center of excellence in Fort Myers extremely hard in late September. While we were able to sell and service our clients from Fort Myers, we did have some delays in getting invoices out as quickly as we normally would. Elections for some of these delayed invoices slipped into January, but we are now caught up. CapEx for the quarter was $38 million, up about $16 million year-over-year, led by increases in capitalized technology labor costs and catch-up laptop spend. Free cash flow for the quarter was $166 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. As many of you know, we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income. Our conversion from EBITDA is also very strong. With the differences being cash interest, cash taxes and modest CapEx, partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 18% on a rolling fourth quarter basis. On the same basis, free cash flow was 68% of EBITDA and 123% of GAAP net income. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had almost $700 million of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing-12-month EBITDA was under 2 times. Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases, and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.7 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased more than $1 billion of stock throughout 2022. We expect the Board will refresh our share repurchase authorization as needed, which they did earlier this month. We now have about $1 billion authorized for share repurchases. Across the past two years, we have returned $2.7 billion to shareholders by repurchasing more than 11 million shares. Over that timeframe, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 11%. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. Before providing the 2023 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2023. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. Our plan allows for a higher-than-normal level of uncertainty in the world as Gene discussed. We've got tough compares across the business and particularly with tech vendors for another quarter or two. We've taken a prudent approach based on historical trends, as well as more normal patterns which we reflected in the guidance. If near-term demand is stronger than we've built into the outlook and NCVI phasing, retention rates, and non-subscription growth performed closer to the way they have historically, there would be upside to our guidance. In addition, our teams are focused on driving greater growth than what's embedded in the guidance. Finally, as you think about GBS overall CV and revenue growth for 2023, please keep in mind that we closed on the divestiture of a small non-core asset last week. We sold Talentneuron which we acquired as part of the CEB transaction for $164 million. In the earnings supplement appendix, we've provided historical contract value updated for 2023 FX rates, as well as the removal of Talentneuron from prior years. For conferences, we are basing our guidance on being 100% in-person for the 47 destination conferences we have planned for 2023. We expect to return to more typical seasonality for the business with fourth quarter the largest followed by the second quarter. For consulting revenues, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization is seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. We had a very strong year in 2022, especially in contract optimization in the fourth quarter. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect significant headcount increases from 2022 annualizing into 2023. Our plan for headcount for 2023 is more in line with our normal model as we caught up on hiring last year. If demand is stronger than what's in the initial plan, we will have opportunity to add even more great talent to our teams. We also expect T&E cost to more fully normalize this year. Finally, we continue to invest in our systems and process automation, both client facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. We will continue both to manage expenses prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins. At current rates, FX will be a modest tailwind to growth for the full-year with the benefit in the second half. Our guidance for 2023 is as follows: we expect research revenue of at least $4.92 billion, which is growth of about 7%. Excluding the effect of the divest adds 1 percentage point to the year-over-year growth rate. We expect conferences revenue of at least $445 million, which is growth of about 14%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $500 million, which is growth of about 4%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.865 billion, which is growth of about 7%. Excluding the divested business from 2022 would add about 80 basis points to the growth rate. As I've mentioned, we've taken a prudent approach to planning for 2023. This applies to revenue, operating expenses and free cash flow. We expect full-year EBITDA of at least $1.26 billion. We expect to be able to deliver at least 21.5% margins in most economic scenarios. If revenue is stronger than our guidance, we expect upside to EBITDA and margins. Included in the guidance is equity comp of $132 million, up from 2022. We expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $8.80 per share. For 2023, we expect free cash flow of at least $920 million. Our EPS guidance is based on 80 million shares, which only assumes repurchases to offset dilution. Finally, for the first quarter of 2023, we expect to deliver at least $310 million of EBITDA. All the details of our full-year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Our strong performance in 2022 continued in the fourth quarter. Contract value grew 12%, adjusted EPS increased 195, fueled in part by the significant reduction of shares in 2021 and 2022. Over the past few years, our hiring has been carefully calibrated to demand and we are well positioned from a top perspective heading into 2023. Our continued investments in our teams will drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. We repurchased more than $1 billion in stock last year and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time. As I mentioned, we expect to generate at least $920 million in free cash flow in 2023. In addition, we have ample liquidity and the net proceeds from last week's divestiture for capital deployment initiatives. Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA, because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? And Jeff, the last part of your question on the territory assignment and where we're putting our growth, we've got a pretty robust territory optimization and analytics team that is always looking at this and we have the ability to very quickly and with a lot of agility flex up or down on where we're putting those territories. And so obviously as we're looking at our selling environment and the growth of the business, we're continuing to allocate those resources accordingly. And then the last thing, I mentioned and you sort of had this buried in your question, but I'll pull it out, is our business selling to the enterprise functions, both in IT and outside of IT through GBS performed very, very well in Q4 and for the full-year. And it was really the tech vendors that had, as Gene said, a very tough compare going from high-teens growth to high-single-digit growth in the quarter. Sure. Good morning, Heather, and thanks for the questions. So I think a couple of thoughts there. So I'll start with conferences and consulting first. And so as we look at those two businesses, again, coming off of very strong 2022, if you look at the backlog position in consulting, we actually entered the year in really good shape. We had a very strong delivery quarter in the fourth quarter, but also a very strong bookings quarter. And again, based on the visibility that we have, roughly through the first half of the year, we feel really good about the consulting business and the trending looks good there. And again, I think our client base to Gene's earlier comments about the tech sector, are still embarking on a lot of -- embarking or continuing on a lot of digital transformation and major tech projects and programs where our consulting team really can't help them get the most value out of that. On the conferences side, again, we had a great year of returning to in-person conferences in 2022 and the team has done a fantastic job of driving forward, what we call, forward bookings, but basically locking up the revenue from the exhibitor side into 2023, and so as Gene mentioned, we've got significantly more than 50% of our pre bookings already under contract. As we head into 2023, and so feel very, very good about the conferences business as well. On the research side, again, our enterprise function leader business is performing very well and we expect that to continue to perform well. We do have -- continue to have tough compares there, but we do -- we're driving great value for our clients and we expect that to continue. We have been thoughtful and prudent about our experience in the fourth quarter with our tech vendor clients and making sure that we don't assume just some magical return to high-teens growth right out of the gate. And so we're trying to be prudent by making sure we use our most recent experience, enrolling that through the four quarters from a research perspective. But again, end user enterprise function leader business again performing very strong, nice double-digit growth rates. The tech vendor business still at high-single-digits. Just down from where we were a year ago. Good morning, Toni. Yes, I mean, the way to think about the bridge from 2022 to 2023 is consistent with the way we've been talking about it for the last several quarters. And so, the biggest piece of it is the annualization of all the hiring we did in 2022 and obviously, paying the full load for all those new associates over the course of 2023. So that's by far the biggest piece of it. A lot of our hiring was back-end loaded or second-half loaded, I should say. And so, obviously, there's a pretty significant uplift in the annual cost as we annualize all of those individuals. There's an element of T&E, to your point. And so, we're -- fourth quarter was kind of in line with where we expected to be. But obviously, the first part of 2022, we were still mostly in lockdown and not traveling. And so, there are incremental T&E expense that we expect in 2023, as we get to kind of the new normal of travel post-pandemic. And there's a few other nits here and there, but the two primary ones are really the annualization of the headcount and a little bit more on the T&E side. Yes, absolutely. So in 2022, the bulk of the story is, what, I discussed in my prepared remarks, which is just some invoicing delays coming out as a result of the Hurricane. And we thought we would be able to get all caught up on that in 2022 and a bunch of it did slip into 2023. And actually, through the end of January, we actually are all caught up on that. So we feel good about both the \u201822 finish and getting that all behind us. In terms of 2023, obviously, there can be a lot of variability to the free cash flow numbers. If you look at it on the surface from the guidance, the free cash flow margin is in line with what we'd expect free cash flow as a percent of EBITDA is roughly where we'd expect and the free cash flow conversion as a percent of GAAP net income is in the range as well. And so, I think the free cash flow guidance and the free cash flow expectation is sort of in line with the business performance. I do think there are a couple of things impacting \u201823 that potentially put it a little bit below your expectations, probably, most notably cash taxes. So because of all that extra earnings in 2022, we have more to pay in taxes, and that's obviously reflected into 2023 free cash flow guidance as well. Yes. And Andrew, just to underscore that, I mean, 18.9% growth for the full-year coming off of a 24% full-year growth in 2021 is really, really strong, continued consistent growth. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, both supply chain and HR were well above 20% year-over-year growth again, coming off of really strong years in 2021 as well. And so, really strong demand there. It's indicative of the fact that across all of GBS, we are providing enormous value to the functional leaders that we serve in finance, HR, supply chain, marketing, sales, legal and so on. Yes. And on top of that, obviously, their mission-critical priorities are not founded by a contractual term. And so, they want to make sure that they have support and insight to support their mission-critical priorities. And so, we've seen no pushback at all on our ability to sell multiyear contracts. Yes, it's a great question. So actually, significantly greater than 50% is actually the -- what both Gene and I said, we're actually comparable or perhaps even a little bit stronger than we were pre-pandemic on that metric. And I think, George, the way to think about just building on Gene's comments, we've -- in \u201821 and \u201822, we invested to rebuild our recruiting function and recruiting capacity. And we have that now available rolling forward. As Gene mentioned, we have a great selling brand and associate brand more broadly for those recruiters to go out and attract people. As we think about the headcount growth for this year, it is more in line with our kind of \u201cnormal algorithm\u201d where we expect to grow headcount 4 points to 5 points lower than CV growth. That being said, given the recruitment capacity we have and given our standing in the market, if we see our CV growth accelerating, it gives us the opportunity to potentially go a little bit faster there. And if we see challenges with the business, we can easily tap the breaks and slow down. So we've built a plan that we feel real comfortable with that is in line with our normal -- or our go-forward model, but also allows us the flexibility to flex up or flex down given on what we're seeing from a demand perspective. Yes. I mean, I think that the major way would be from revenue upside. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've taken a prudent approach on the revenue, on the expenses and on the free cash flow. And if revenue does come in stronger, we would anticipate potential upside to the margins, that's probably the primary way that we see it. We are, again, making sure that we are calibrating all of our expenses most notably headcount, but all of our expenses with what we're seeing from a revenue perspective. And we're making sure that we're also seeing the right investments so that we can sustain growth into the future and also deliver really, really strong margins. And so, we feel like we've got the balance right now. We're obviously -- our structural margins are significantly higher than they were pre-pandemic. And as we talk about, we believe we could modestly expand margins on a year-over-year-over-year basis moving forward. Jeff, I won't comment on your Jimmy Neutron comment. We'll save that for later. In terms of wallet retention, again, I think it's consistent with the way we talked about all of the GTS business earlier and the overall research business as well. Our enterprise function leader business performed very, very well across GBS and GTS. And essentially, what you're seeing in the wild is just that deceleration of the tech vendor business from high teens growth to single-digit growth. Even with that, it's still really strong at 105%, obviously, well above 100% and significantly in excess of client retention. And so, the core value is still there. But the slight deceleration or variance on a year-over-year basis can be completely attributed to the tech center business. And again, I underscore the enterprise function business in both GTS and GBS performed very well in the fourth quarter. Hey, good morning, Manav. So we didn't talk about the expectation from a CV growth perspective. For any part of the business, we don't provide CV guidance or anything like that. I think, again, it's -- as we built the plan and our guidance for 2023, we've utilized what we saw in the fourth quarter in terms of retention metrics, new business metrics and productivity metrics and things of that nature as some of the inputs to extrapolate out our expectation for 2023. I think on the tech vendor side, in particular, obviously, there's a lot going on in that industry right now. We're still selling through it. High-single-digit growth is still pretty nice growth, just not high-teens growth. And so, we believe that given the value proposition that we have for even leaders in that space, that we've got a great value proposition and a great set of products, and we'll continue to serve those clients and help them with their mission-critical priorities in the same way that we help the enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS. Yes. So we recalibrated the way that we were going to grow the sales force back in 2019. And essentially, the model -- obviously, 2022 is different, because we had to do a lot of catch up. But our model moving forward is we want to essentially not dilute our overall cost of sale. And the way we do that is grow the sales headcount, call it, 4 points to 5 points depending on wage inflation, slower than CV growth. That's our stated model moving forward. And so, that's what we've got in place for 2023. And so, yes, it will not be 10% to 15% headcount growth unless we see 15% to 20% CV growth. And again, as I mentioned, during George's question, we believe we are set up to speed up or slow down accordingly as needed. And so, if we see CV growth start to accelerate, we have the recruitment capacity to be able to increase that. And if we see CV growth slowing, we obviously can tap the brakes as well. So we feel like we're in a really, really good place from a talent perspective. We are, as we both mentioned, Gene and I carefully calibrating headcount growth and expenses. And we feel like we've struck the right balance between making sure we're investing for future growth and delivering strong margin performance."

            "name": "Gene Hall",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove a strong performance in the fourth quarter with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS. We generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow and we returned even more than that to shareholders through our ongoing share repurchase program. Enterprise leaders are dealing with high volatility and uncertainty. Inflation accelerated to the highest level in 40-years. The dollar was the strongest it's been in 20-years and it remains extremely volatile. There are ongoing supply chain issues, energy prices has been volatile. The labor market has been volatile. Enterprises are assessing the impact of remote versus hybrid versus in-person work. There are widespread concerns of a recession. All of these factors and more impact enterprises around the world. Leaders need help navigating this turbulent time and they know Gartner is the best source for that help. Our services often make the difference between success and failure for executives and their enterprises. We help clients succeed with their mission critical priorities, whether they're in growth mode or cutting costs. With all this volatility, our most recent research shows that Chief Financial Officers are more carefully scrutinizing expenses. But at the same time, they're increasing investment and mission critical priorities. Even in enterprises, they are under extreme financial pressure. Our research business continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. We help leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is fast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever. Research revenue grew 13% in the fourth quarter. Total contract value growth was 12%. Contract value growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. We serve the executives and their teams through two distinct sales channels: global technology sales or GTS is our largest sales force. GTS contract value grew 11%. The large majority of GTS serves IP leaders and their teams and we saw double-digit growth with this client segment despite tough compares. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs and product managers. In this segment, growth moderated, but still grew at high-single-digits, despite even tougher compares. Global Business Sales or GBS serves leaders in their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 19% in 2022. In the five years since we launched our GXL products within GBS, we've seen exceptional compound annual growth rates. Gartner conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights and engaged and qualified audience. In the first half of 2022, we delivered most of our conferences virtually. In the second half, we pivoted back to in-person for nearly all our conferences. Feedback has been excellent. Most in-person conferences were sold out in 2022 and we've sold significantly more than half of our exhibitor space for 2023. Gartner consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 24% in the fourth quarter. We exited the year with a strong backlog and pipeline. Our business is fueled by our highly talented associates. During 2022, we grew our team by about 2,900 associates. With this growth, we ended 2022 with the lowest percentage of open positions ever. When we're fully staffed, we provide our clients better service, which results in better retention. We also sell more in territories that are fully staffed. We have carefully aligned our hiring with recent demand and the long-term opportunity we have for growth. Our 2023 outlook reflects our most recent experiences from Q4. We've also been prudent in considering the potential impact of volatility from the global environment. We expect to deliver at least 21.5% margins across a wide range of economic scenarios. And our guidance has opportunity for upside if the business performs in line with historical trends. Craig will take you through our guidance in more detail. One of the unique things about Gartner is that we provide value to enterprises that are thriving, shortly or anywhere in between. By being exceptionally agile and adapting to the changing world, we have sustained record of success. We're well prepared as we enter 2023. We've carefully aligned staffing levels with demand and we have the lowest percentage of open positions ever. Our content addresses today's mission critical priorities. And we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. In closing, we again saw strong growth across the business. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to drive growth far into the future. Even as we invest for future growth, we expect margins to increase modestly over time and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income or return capital to our shareholders through buybacks, which reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Hey, Jeff. It's Gene, I'll get started. So as we think about the tech vendor channel, I'm going to start with tech industry itself, the technology companies. And we think that those as being in two different segments: One, is sort of enterprise IT and the other is consumer and devices, things like that. On the enterprise IT, we're expecting the technology companies -- technology vendors to grow about 7.8% globally during \u201823. And the reason they're growing pretty robustly is that enterprise IT spending that's the ones that are not certainly consumers is selling to large complex B2B sales and they tend to be multi-year contracts and annual increases, et cetera. So that's the technology vendors that are selling to enterprise IT. They're also seeing continued demand for cloud, security, digital modernization. And so all those things are growing at a much higher rate than the general tech industry. And when we survey CEOs, that CEO's this is a end users, their customers, they're buying the speed of the equipment. Their business is saying things, I believe digital modernization is still really important to meet the economic situation, as well as staffing situations they face, as well as consumer requirements for more technology and services they offer. So on the enterprise IT, just summarizing the enterprise IT, tech vendors, we have to see that growing about 7.8% globally at '23. On the consumer device side, that's going to be a lot worse in the sense that we expect demand to be lower there. And that's because a lot of demand was pulled forward during the recession and during the pandemic. And so there's sort of a tale of two cities in the tech industry. So that's the tech vendors themselves, our business is predominantly on the enterprise IT side. We just proportionally serve those. So looking forward, we expect actually to check vendors that we serve to be doing okay as opposed to the consumer and device manufacturers, which we expect actually to shrink during 2023. And so that translates into our own business we expect -- we had a -- as Craig [Indiscernible] results, our vendor, our sales force that sells to technology vendors actually went from very high teens growth. I'm sorry, that's a high teens growth to low-single-digit growth. So they actually -- I'm sorry in high-single-digit growth. So they actually performed pretty well in the fourth quarter. Going forward again because our major business is selling to the enterprise IT technology vendors, we expect that business to do pretty well on a go forward basis. Yes. So Jeff, I mean, again, the way to kind of think about the results in quarter and if you look at it on a rolling four quarter basis, is again that the end user side of the GTS business held up really, really well. And performed really well throughout the year and in the fourth quarter, including the productivity. And again just we saw that deceleration from high-teens to high-single-digits, obviously impacting the productivity as well. I think as we have brought in more and more new associates and the sales force. Last year, we talked about in 2021 rather, we had the best tender mix we've ever had. In 2022, we had really the highest proportion of new people we've ever had that's obviously going to impact productivity. We'll start to see the benefits of the tenuring over the course of 2023 as all of those people we hired over the course of 2022 start getting up the productivity curves. Hey, Heather, it's Gene. So we always train our associates on what are the most important mission critical priorities with our clients and prospects today. One of the issues that's going to be on people's minds in some industries is going to be cost reduction. And so we train our salespeople on, among other things how to help clients with cost reduction. We're a very small proportion of cost for any client. They can't -- they're not going to save a lot of money by cutting our services. On the other hand, we can help them save a whole number of multiples of what they pay for us in their actual ongoing business. In addition to that, as I mentioned earlier, most companies, even in a tough environment [Indiscernible] they want to invest in technology and it's on things, like automation that helps with their own labor situation, their own labor costs, [Indiscernible] other kinds of costs. And again, the continuing transition to more and more digital services that are often in just about every single industry. So we train our new salespeople on both how to sell to clients that value proposition, which is the continuing transition to digital, but also how to save money on their IT purchases, so that they actually get -- they could be more efficient over time. So the combination of those things, and of course, our traditional selling skills where we -- I think, are quite good at training new salespeople in terms of how to sell effectively, you put those things together and it lets new salespeople -- they're not as productive as experienced salespeople, but they're actually quite good in the broad context. Yes. Hey Andrew. So the -- our strategy is to have conferences for all the major functional areas in our businesses, I think, in IT, HR, finance, et cetera, as well as within -- cybersecurity applications and so forth. And we're far from that now -- and sorry, and also each of those conferences in each of our major geographies. And so, there's a -- it will take us a long time to get to the point where we have the aspiration I just said, which is to have a conference for every major of share count in every major geographic region. And we're at -- because these conferences add so much value to our -- the attendees, our seat holders that actually go and attend these conferences, we really want to expand those as quickly as we can. We're limited by what you do operationally with how fast we can actually hire people and build these conferences. And so, we're going to continue on that path. We did that -- we've had as an as we think we can handle operationally in 2023. If we find during the year, we can have more, we will do that. And certainly, in \u201824, \u201825, \u201826, we expect to have a continuing expansion of these conferences, again, because of the very high value they provide to our attendees, our seat holders and also our prospects. Yes. We had great performance in GBS during 2022, including the fourth quarter. There's tremendous opportunity in GBS. As with the rest of our business, really grow GBS as quickly as we can to capture that enormous opportunity. We had growth in -- across all functional areas, very robust growth, actually. And the areas that were slower, it was more internal operational things that we had. So for example, we might have had one area where we were a little slow in hiring than another area. And so, the places that GBS was a little slower, we believe are more due to more internal operational things that we're working on. But again, the overall performance was very strong, we're very happy with that performance. Yes. So we've had larger-than-usual price increases over the recent past, because of accelerated inflation. And we've had, I'd say, essentially zero pushback from our clients on it. And if you look at the cost of Gartner for an individual user or for even a contract for the company, it's a small ticket item. And whether it increases 3% or 7% isn't a swing factor. The swing factor is the value we provide. And we provide a tremendous better value to these clients for the costs that they have to pay, spend any alternative and can provide some credible value. So we have had, I'd say, kind of, no measurable pushback on our price increases, even though they're at higher rates. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. In fact, again, the -- many of our clients prefer multi-year contracts. It's a small ticket item and they have administrative costs in dealing with it. And so, many, if not most of our clients actually prefer multi-years, because the procurement people don't want to waste their time doing this over and over again. And so, to actually see demand from our clients for multi-years as opposed to the other way around. Hi, Jeff. So Talentneuron is a business that provides data -- labor market data, principally to people that -- in companies, that are doing long-term planning for where companies should have their workforce. And we've got the business when we bought CEB. It was an acquisition CEB had done. When we bought CEB, therefore, we acquired that business. As we looked at it, we've been looking at the business to see does it really fit with our business on a go-forward basis, and it is strategic to us. We've looked at it in a lot of depth. We've looked for innovative ways we could use it. And at the end of the day, we decided that it was not a strategic bet that were better owners for that business than us, which is why we divested it. Let's just focus on the -- our core business in HR, which that was not really related to. In terms of other divestitures, again, if we see things that don't fit our core business, we would divest them. We'll discuss those when it's appropriate. Here's what I'd like you to take away from today's call. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we again saw strong growth across the business. Gartner delivers incredible value to enterprises that are thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. By being exceptionally agile and adaptive to a changing world, we've delivered a sustained record of success. We're well prepared as we enter 2023. We've carefully aligned staffing levels with demand and with the lowest percentage of open positions ever. Our content is today's mission-critical priorities. And we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to drive growth far into the future. And even as we invest for future growth, we expect margin to increase modestly over time. We generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. We'll return capital to our shareholders through buybacks, which reduced shares outstanding and increases returns over time. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nGene Hall: Good morning. Thanks for joining us. We continue to deliver incredible value to more than 15,000 enterprises around the world. This led to another strong performance in the third quarter. We achieved double digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS. We have strong growth in all practices, all industry sectors, across every size plant and in every region. In addition, through Q3, we repurchased over a billion dollars of stock. Our clients continue to face a rapidly changing world, things like digital transformation, future of work, high inflation, shifting customer needs, supply chain disruptions, and more. Our clients know they need help on these issues. And they know Gartner is the best source of help. Through our actual objective insights we help executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions achieve their mission critical priorities. We know how to help whether our clients are thriving, struggling, or somewhere in between. With all of this demand for our services remain strong. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segments. Total research revenue grew 15%. Contract value growth was 14%. We serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global technology Sales or GTS serves leaders and their teams within IT. We help chief information officers achieve mission critical priorities, such as leading digital transformations, financing talent and challenging labor market and fueling innovation. GTS contract value group 13%. Global business sales or GBS service leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. We help leaders across these functions achieve their mission critical priorities. For example, we help HR leaders engage employees in a hybrid world, evolve organizational design with the transition to digital business, manage compensation in an inflationary environment, manage employee expectations on divisive social issues, and re-imagine the future of work. GBS contract valued grew 21%. Across GTS and GBS were driving relentless execution of proven practices, which in turn is driving our sustained results. Gartner conferences delivered valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. We continued our returns in person conferences. In October, we hosted two of our flagship conferences, IT symposium and Reimagine HR both in Orlando, Florida. Compared to 2019 attendance in IT symposium was up 12% and Reimagine HR attendance doubled. The feedback from our in person conferences has been resoundingly positive. Gartner consulting is an extension of Gartner research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project based work. Consulting revenue grew 21% in the third quarter. Over the past few quarters the rapid growth of our business outpaced hiring. This quarter our associate base grew 18% year-over-year. This provides the capacity we need to serve our rapidly growing base of licensed users and positions us for sustained future growth. In closing, Gartner delivered another strong performance. We\u2019ve caught up on hiring in our position to deliver sustained future growth. Our underlying margins are in the low 20s comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. We expect them to modestly increase over time. We\u2019ll continue to generate significant free cash flow in excess net income and will continue to return significant levels of capital to our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. \nCraig Safian: Thank you Gene and good morning. Third quarter results were strong with double digit growth and contract value revenue and adjusted EPS. FX neutral growth was even stronger than our reported results. We also delivered better than planned EBITDA margins, reflecting the strong third quarter, enthusiastic demand for our in person conferences and continued success in balancing cost discipline with investing for future growth we are again increasing our 2022 guidance. Third quarter revenue was $1.3 billion up 15% year-over-year as reported and 20% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69% down 20 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $332 million up 9% year-over-year and up 15% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.41 up 19% and free cash flow in the quarter was $283 million. Research revenue in the third quarter grew 11% year-over-year as reported and 15% on an FX neutral basis driven by our strong contract value growth. Third quarter research contribution margin was 74% modestly below last year. The continued higher than normal contribution margin reflects improved operational effectiveness, increased scale, travel expenses still modestly below our post pandemic expectations and research related headcount with a bit more catch up still to go. Contract value or CV was $4.5 billion at the end of the third quarter up 14.5% versus the prior year. CV growth is always FX neutral. Excluding the impact of exiting Russia, growth for Q3 would have been 14.9%. Quarterly net contract value increase or NCBI was $128 million. Quarterly NCBI is a helpful way to measure contracts value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. The sequential increase in CV of $128 million was driven by the combination of continued strong retention rates and near record new business of almost $250 million similar to the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of 2021. The 14.9% contract value growth was broad based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes, and geographic regions. Our technology practice grew 13% and all of our business practices led by HR and supply chain grew at double digit growth rates. All industry sectors including technology grew at double digit rates, with the fastest growth in transportation, retail and manufacturing. We had double digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories with our medium category growing the fastest. In the small category, the technology sector continued to grow at double digit rates. We also drove double digit growth across all of our top 10 countries other than China, where we saw continued single digit growth. Across our North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, all industry sectors had double digit growth rates. Global Technology sales contract value was $3.5 billion at the end of the third quarter up 13% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCBI of $88 million driven by strong retention and near record levels of new business for a third quarter. While retention for GTS was again strong at 107% for the quarter up about 310 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business was down 5% versus last year up against another tough compare. The two year compound annual growth rate was about 9%. GTS quota bearing headcount was up 16% compared to September of last year. Our continued investments in our sales teams will drive long term sustained double digit growth. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global Business sales contract value was $977 million at the end of the third quarter of 21% year-over-year which is above the high end of our medium term outlook of 12 to 16% GBS. CV increased $40 million from the second quarter, while retention for GBS was 114% for the quarter, up about 120 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 1% compared to last year against the strong compare. The two year compound annual growth rate for new business was 18%. GBS quarter bearing headcount increased 19% year-over-year. Headcount we hire in 2022 will help to position us for sustained double digit growth in the future. As with GTS our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the third quarter was $77 million ahead of our expectations as attendees and exhibitors were excited to get back to the in person experience. Contribution margin in the quarter was 52%. We held 10 in person conferences and three virtual conferences in the quarter. We held meetings in both virtual and in person formats. We plan to run nine in person destination conferences in the fourth quarter and have updated our guidance to reflect the strong demand we are seeing. Third quarter consulting revenues increased by 13% year-over-year to $107 million. On an FX neutral basis revenues were up 21%. Consulting contribution margin was 35% in the third quarter up 210 basis points versus the prior year with better than expected revenue and higher utilization rates. Labor base revenues were $90 million up 16% versus Q3 of last year and up 26% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at September 30 was $162 million increasing 33% year-over-year on an FX basis with another strong bookings quarter. The inclusion of multiyear contracts in our backlog calculation, a change we described earlier in the year contributed about 11 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate. Our contract optimization business declined three percentage reported and 1% on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services increased 16% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and 21% on an FX neutral basis. The biggest drivers of the increase were higher headcount to support our continued strong growth and the return to in person destination conferences. SG&A increased 20% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported, and 24% on an FX neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of added headcount for sales and G&A functions and higher commissions following a strong CV growth in 2021. We expect SG&A expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue over the near term as our catch up hiring continues. EBITDA for the third quarter was $332 million, up 9% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 15% FX neutral. Third quarter EBITDA upside for guidance reflected revenue exceeding our forecasts and expenses at the low end of our expectations. Depreciation in the third quarter of $23 million was down modestly versus 2021. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $29 million, done a little over $1 million versus the third quarter of 2021 mainly due to lower interest rate swaps costs. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q3 adjusted tax rate which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 24.7% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust that income was 20.2% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.41 growth of 19% year-over-year. The average share count for the third quarter was 80 million shares. This is a reduction of about 4.7 million shares or about 5.6% year-over-year. We exited the third quarter with about 80 million shares outstanding on an un-weighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $315 million down 9% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $32 million up about $18 million year-over-year led by increases in capitalized technology labor costs and catch up laptop spend. Free cash flow for the quarter was $283 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. As many of -- we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income. Our conversion from EBITDA is very strong with the differences between cash interest, cash taxes and modest CapEx partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows. Adjusting for the insurance proceeds we received last year free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 19% on a rolling four quarter basis. On the same basis free cash flow is 76% of EBITDA and 137% of GAAP net income. At the end of the third quarter we had $529 million of cash. Our September 30 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt for trailing 12 month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.5 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased more than $1 billion worth of stock through the end of the third quarter. We had about $600 million remaining on our authorization at the end of September, which we expect the board will continue to refresh as needed going forward. Since the end of 2020 through the end of this September, we\u2019ve reduced our shares outstanding by 10 million shares. This is a reduction of 11%. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is a creative to earnings per share, and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are increasing our full year guidance to reflect strong Q3 performance and an improved outlook for the fourth quarter despite incremental FX headwinds. We now expect an FX impact or full year revenue growth rates of about 420 basis points for the full year. This is up from 370 basis points based on rates when we guided in August. As we discussed the last three quarters 2021 research performance benefited from several factors including QBH tenure mix, NCVI phasing within the quarters and year, record retention rates and strong non-subscription growth. The growth compares will continue to be challenging for a few more quarters. We continue to take a measured approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we\u2019ve reflected in the updated guidance. For conferences we assume we will be able to run all nine in person conferences as planned. Consistent with our commentary the past couple of quarters, our assumptions for consolidated expenses continue to reflect significant headcount increases during the fourth quarter to support current and future growth. We continue to model higher labor costs and T&E teeny well above 2021 levels as we\u2019ve previously indicated. We also have higher commission expense during 2022 due to the exceptional performance we delivered in 2021. Finally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. Our updated guidance for 2022 is as follows. We expect research revenue of at least $4.58 billion, which is FX neutral growth of about 16%. The FX neutral growth is up about 60 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong NCVI performance in the third quarter. We expect conferences revenue of at least $375 million, which is growth of about 84% FX neutral. We expect consulting revenue of at least $450 million, which is growth about 14% FX neutral. The result is an outlet for consolidated revenue of at least $5.40 billion, which is FX neutral growth of almost 19%. The FX neutral growth is up about 180 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong performance in third quarter and improved outlook for Q4. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since August, our revenue outlook would have been about $85 million higher than previous guidance. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.36 billion, up $125 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since August, our EBITDA guidance would have been about $136 million higher than previous guidance. We now expect 2022 adjusted EPS at least $10.06 per share. For 2022 we now expect free cash flow at least 1.0 to $5 billion. Our EPS guidance is based on 81 million shares, which reflects year-to-date repurchases. As a result, we expect to deliver at least $310 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2022. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Our strong performance in 2022 continued in the third quarter with momentum across the business. Contract value grew 14%. Adjusted EPS increased 19% fueled in part by the significant reduction of shares over the past year. We are adding associates across the business to keep up with our growth and to position us well heading into 2023. Our continued investments in our teams will drive long term sustained double digit growth. We repurchase more than $1 billion in stock this year through September and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double digit revenue growth with gross margin expansion sales cost growing in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront and we will continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck in M&A. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is now open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you just maybe if I could better understand the messaging on where you are in terms of catch up hiring. I thought for Jene, you talked about 80% associate growth and having the capacity you need and being caught up on hiring but then it seemed like in Craig\u2019s comments, you\u2019re still calling up some areas where you\u2019re still in the process of doing catch up hiring and you\u2019re maintaining the low 20s underlying margin target despite seemingly run rating above that on a seasonally adjusted basis. So just if I could better understand where you are in that process.\nGene Hall: Jeff, it\u2019s Gene. So the 18% associated growth that talked about on the call is largely catch up hiring. If you look over the last three years or so we had very robust growth in our business. And our hiring lag behind that give you a flavor for the compound growth rate or sub contract value was about 11%. And the compound growth rate of headcount was about 5.5%. And so it lagged a lot we got behind. The good news is that we\u2019re as of Q3, end of Q3 we are almost fully caught up. And so we expect to see not the same rate of hiring as we go into Q4 next year, we expect to normalize more which we\u2019ve done traditionally, which is to have our headcount growth, have CV grow about five or six points higher than actual headcount growth going forward.\nJeff Meuler: And then, obviously notable, the big step up in GTS quota bears, I guess, just to what extent, are you seeing signs of unmet demand that you\u2019re fulfilling, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s showing up in the new business sold metric with GTS which also has the tough comp, just trying to understand to what extent maybe the 12%, or 12.5% whatever was CV growth in GTS has been governed down because of some sales capacity constraints that you\u2019re addressing versus to what extent this is about getting out ahead of demand and building capacity into what\u2019s still a good demand momentum environment.\nCraig Safian: Jeff, good morning. It\u2019s Craig. Just a couple of points and then Gene will fill in any blanks. So as Gene mentioned, we did fall behind in terms of our headcount hiring across the business, but probably most notably in GTS over the course of 2021, especially as that segments, CV really accelerated. And so a lot of what we were doing, starting in the first three quarter of \u201821, and through the first three quarters of this year is catching up and filling open territories. And the open territory challenge and opportunity was a little exacerbated by the accelerated growth. And we had to promote more people than we normally do, as we\u2019ve talked about in previous quarters at the beginning of the year which put even more of an emphasis on making sure that we were recruiting and growing our primary hire face. And so to think about it, and again, we talked about this when we did our initial guide for the year as well, which was last year, we had the benefit of the most, the highest proportion of tenured sellers that we\u2019ve ever had, obviously, this year is reversed. And as we roll into next year, we expect it to be more \u201cnormal\u201d like we\u2019ve seen historically. And so the all those dynamics are at play as well and again, as you think about Gene\u2019s comment earlier on, we\u2019re catching up, but we\u2019re also making sure that we are seeding the ground with investments so that we can sustain our double digit growth into the future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Wanted to ask on the conferences that symposium had better attendance in pre-pandemic. Are there any gating factors that should lead 2023 to not be fully back to 2019 levels or higher, just assuming that current travel restrictions stay as they are now? \nCraig Safian: Good morning, Toni. Thanks for the question. So, it\u2019s been great to return to in person conferences. And as we\u2019ve said the past few quarters and Gene referenced some large October conferences as well. We\u2019ve had exhibitors and attendees really enthusiastically returned, which is awesome. And the conferences are hugely valuable to everyone who goes and its super valuable to the entire Gartner franchise. As we look towards 2023 and again, we\u2019ll give guidance in February around the full calendar of \u201823 conferences, etc. We\u2019re not going to be anywhere near the 70 conferences, destination conferences that we delivered in 2019. We are carefully building back up. Our goal over the long term is to have a conference for every major function that we cover in every major geography in which we do business. But we can\u2019t just snap our fingers and be there. It takes time to build those up and to re-launch that. And so we are taking a measured approach to doing that. We\u2019re going to be as aggressive as we can, but we\u2019re going to be nowhere near the 70 conferences that we ran in 2019 pre-pandemic.\nToni Kaplan: And I actually wanted to ask about that the new business growth as well. So you mentioned the GTS have down five and GBS of one. The comp was very tough and the two year CAGR are good. I guess, with the sales hiring, that those would be higher. I know, you said stuff catch up that you\u2019re doing. But I guess like, what are your thoughts on the level of like, those new business levels? And I guess I\u2019m only asking because everything else seemed like, is going really, really strong. And so that\u2019s sort of the one that I think, maybe it\u2019s pick. So just what are your thoughts on the new business? Thanks. \nGene Hall: Hey Toni, it\u2019s Gene. So our new business was at an all time high. So just to be clear, wasn\u2019t like it was not a good compared to business acumen for dollars was at an all time high, it was near an all time high. Secondly, the fact that it\u2019s impacting new business the most that Craig talked about in terms of the proportion of our sales force, it is tenured versus non-tenured. Last year, we had, as Craig mentioned, the highest proportion of tenured salespeople that we have on record. This year, because of promotions and growth hiring, we had among the lowest proportion of tenured salespeople on record. And a tenured salesperson sells whole number multiples higher, more in new business than a non-tenured salesperson. The productivity accelerates rapidly during the salespersons first three years. And that\u2019s the primary factor that impacted our business in Q3.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. I wanted to start just with a question on sales activity levels. As the quarter progressed, and maybe into October, did you notice any and it\u2019s seems like double digit growth across every practice, every industry, every region, every client size, but was there any kind of distinguishing change over the course of the quarter? Or are those conversations and the length of contract cycles relatively consistent with what you\u2019ve seen year-to-date?\nGene Hall: Hey Andrew. So during the quarter, I would say was typical, with September being slightly stronger than with a little bit more acceleration during the quarter than you might normally see. But within a small range, call it overall a pretty normal quarter.\nAndrew Nicholas: And then you talked quite a bit about the catch up hiring and the sales force growth. What about on the kind of T&E side. Where do you sit relative to kind of pre-pandemic levels and where you would ultimately expect those expenses to level off? I think last quarter, you talked about the second half of the year being more indicative of normal travel. So just wondering if that\u2019s in the third quarter number, if there\u2019s still some more increases to expect there as well. Thank you.\nCraig Safian: Good morning, Andrew. It\u2019s Craig. Yes, so we\u2019re obviously orders of magnitude lower than 2019 by design, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to run it going forward. I would say Q3 is almost back to where we think the new normal should be. So Q3 and Q4 will be pretty close to the new normal. But also recognizing that as we roll out more conferences, as we travel to see our global teams, etc there might be a little bit more lift in the travel number, but not order of magnitude lift. We feel pretty good about where we are, again, there\u2019s probably a little bit more uplift that we\u2019ll see in travel rolling into next year, but Q3 and Q4 are roughly indicative of what we expect moving forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nSeth Weber: Good morning. I wanted to touch on if you could give us any thoughts on the pricing environment. I think last quarter and you\u2019ve talked about pricing is kind of running a little bit above sort of normal levels. Can you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing there and customer appetite for multiyear contracts and of just given the uncertain environment. Thank you.\nCraig Safian: Good morning Seth it\u2019s Craig. So I agree with your assertion on the pricing. So rolling into this year, we were a little bit more aggressive than we normally have been. So we\u2019ve typically been in the 3% to 4% range this year thinking the five-ish to 6% range, in terms of overall price increase, similar rolling into next year. Price increase actually went effective today for most of our clients and sellers around the world. And we haven\u2019t seen much friction or pushback from clients on that. Obviously, it is a more inflationary environment. Our costs are going up roughly in that range and we\u2019re roughly pricing to offset that. In terms of the multiyear comment I think our sales teams do a fantastic job of articulating the value that we can deliver over the short term, over the medium term and over the long term. And they\u2019ve done a fantastic job of continuing to get our clients to sign up for multiyear contracts. So we haven\u2019t really seen a step back in that from clients either.\nSeth Weber: And then maybe just on the share repurchase in the quarter it stepped down from where it\u2019s been trending for the last, I don\u2019t know, the last year and a quarter year and a half or so. Was that just kind of front end loaded some of the spending in the first half of the year or so just saying, are you just trying to save some powder for M&A or anything that we should read into the tick down here in the third quarter and share repurchase?\nCraig Safian: No, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it. I\u2019d say on a year-to-day basis, we\u2019re over a billion dollars in share repurchases over the last seven quarters, it\u2019s 2.6-ish billion dollars of share repurchases, it remains our primary use of capital going forward and we\u2019ll bump up or bump down from time to time from quarter to quarter. But over the long over the last seven quarters, we\u2019ve obviously returned a lot of capital to shareholders through our repurchase programs. And moving forward, we expect return a lot of capital for our shareholders or repurchase programs.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Tong: You had a big step up in sales headcount in 3Q notably in GTS. Was there any pull forward in hiring from 4Q? Or do you expect to continue to see healthy increases in headcount in 4Q on a quarter-over-quarter basis?\nGene Hall: So we\u2019re focused on ending the year of double digit in a quarter bearing headcount, again, really making sure that we\u2019re set up to roll into 2023 with full territories and a more tenured sales force etc. There can obviously be a lot of puts and takes, but what I\u2019d say is we expect to end the year for both GTS and GBS with strong double digit quarter bearing hires growth on a year-over-year basis.\nGeorge Tong: And then with respect to EBITDA margins, your outlook continues to move higher. Can you just at a high level frame for us your evolving views around normalized EBITDA margins and how your investment activity so far this year are on pace to get you back to what normalized spending should be?\nCraig Safian: Yes, absolutely. And Gene feel free to fill in any blanks here as well. So as Gene mentioned in his prepared remarks and as we have been saying, for the last couple of quarters, we now believe the underlying metrics, the underlying margin of the business is in the low 20s, which is obviously comfortably and well above pre-pandemic levels of EBITDA margins. I think there are a number of factors that have allowed us to increase that outlook as we\u2019ve gotten comfortable with the way the business is running and the way we\u2019re running the business. Most notably, I would say, is one as Gene mentioned, we\u2019re going to grow our CV base about four to five or five to six points faster than we grow our quarter bearing hires. That allows us to essentially fix our cost of sale, if you will, or not dilute our margins through cost of sale. We can get gross margin leverage just by virtue of research being our biggest and most profitable segment and we can get a little G&A leverage as well going forward. On top of that with GBS we were starting to see or we\u2019re seeing returns on the investments that we made in 2017 and 2018. And we now have much more scale in that business. There is still a lot of scale to be gained in GBS but obviously, we\u2019re orders of magnitude higher in our contract values, and we were pre-pandemic. And so again and then there are other things like real estate and travel, where we just gotten smarter around the way we run our business, which have also helped us to raise our expectation on what the underlying margins of the business are. Clearly we\u2019ve done a lot of hiring through the course of 2022, as Gene mentioned, and we\u2019ve said multiple times, most of that was catch up hiring from all the growth we delivered in 2021 and 2022. Obviously, those costs roll into \u201823, which is why we\u2019re stating and sticking to the fact that our underlying margins are in the low 20s. And that we can grow our business at double digit growth rates moving forward, and we can modestly improve those margins over time as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJeff Silber: Thank you so much. I wanted to go back to the earlier pricing question. I know this segment or this industry that you\u2019re in is very broad, but some of the other info services companies that we talked to have started to be a little bit more aggressive in terms of giving price concessions in exchange for multiyear contracts. Are you doing any of that? Are you seeing that in the market as well?\nGene Hall: So Jeff, good morning. No, not really. I think we lead with multiyear contracts as sort of the de facto standard. That\u2019s generally what our clients want, because they\u2019re missing critical priorities, are not bounded by a 12 month contract or something like that. And so we\u2019ve seen real no change in the selling environment, or the selling motion around the price increase we\u2019ve talked about earlier as well as our contracted vehicles.\nCraig Safian: We haven\u2019t changed our pricing on multiyear approach, or multiyear contracts, the pricing approach has remained the same.\nJeff Silber: And I know in your prepared comments, you talked about the strength in your research business being broad based. I just was wondering, we can parse down a little bit if there\u2019s specific end markets that are doing better, or worse than others, and I\u2019m specifically interested in Europe versus the U.S. Thanks.\nGene Hall: So as Craig mentioned, both North America and Europe had double digit growth in the third quarter.\nCraig Safian: And we saw, and it was broad, based across Europe and North America from an industry and size perspective. So there\u2019s really nothing to point to in terms of softness. It\u2019s the average growth for GTS and overall for GTS is around 13%, and overall, around 14%. And when you peel back the onion, it\u2019s pretty close to that at lower levels, whether you live regionally industry, by size, etc.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Gene and Craig and I guess historically, I think you guys just talk about how to do it up two to three points about sales force growth. And now on the call, I\u2019ve heard you say four, five and six. So in that context, I guess, should we still expect Gartner to keep going that sales force 10% to 15% year-over-year like use methods in the past?\nGene Hall: I think the way to think about it is that we want to make sure that our cost of sale, if you will, so sales cost as a percent of CV or percent of revenue remain roughly fixed. And we believe we can do that by having CV growth at whatever that is or whatever we deliver, and toggling the amount of headcount growth so that we keep our cost of sale roughly fixed. If CV is growing 20% then yes, we would grow headcount yes close to 15%. Is CV we\u2019re growing 10% we would probably, we would toggle down the growth investment to again, lock in, roughly lock in that overall cost of sale. And so this is a pivot we made in the second half of 2019 as we shifted to really wanted to make sure that we got returns on the investments we\u2019re making, and managed the sales portion of our overall margin. I think the one difference that you point to, which is the gap between CV growth and headcount growth is really just driven by what we\u2019re seeing from a wage inflation perspective. And so when it was three to four point gap, that\u2019s because that that\u2019s what we were seeing from wage inflation perspective. Now, we\u2019re obviously seeing a little bit greater. So we\u2019re just dialing that into our growth algorithm to make sure that we account for it.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then, in the core you made comments around SG&A being elevated. Was that a fourth quarter specific comment or more longer term? And also, just to clarify you talked about the Q3 and Q4 runway kind of being where you want it to be. But that was specific to T&E I believe we just talked about from an overall margin perspective, how we should think about today numbers below 20, to talk about.\nGene Hall: Yes, absolutely. So the SG&A comment is more of a near term comment. So as we are catching up on the hiring and you get [Audio Gap] just think about high teens growth we\u2019re seeing in both GTS and GBS. Obviously, that rolls into next year, because we, the hiring was really concentrated in the back half of the year. And so that will put pressure on the cost of sale and margin as designed into 2023. So it\u2019s more of a near term comment. In terms of the other things we\u2019re seeing again, we talked about the growing sales force a little bit, or growing to be a little bit faster than we\u2019re growing the sales force, etc. That is more in a steady state, obviously, 2022 as we indicated at the beginning of the year, and we have indicated each quarter, as we move through the year, there was a lot of catch up happening in 2022. And that obviously impacts 2023. We believe, again, that the underlying margins for the business are in the low 20s. And that through the combination of the investments we\u2019re making, the size of the market opportunity opportunities in productivity, etc, that we can grow the business, the top line at double digit growth rates, and modestly expand margins from that underlying margin in the low 20s.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to touch a bit on the hiring. Maybe it\u2019d be helpful to provide just on where wage inflation stands and we\u2019re going to kind of be aggressive hiring that we think this year.\nGene Hall: Hey, good morning, Stephanie. We had a little trouble hearing you. I think what you asked was just provide a little bit more color around our hiring trends and where we may be seeing more pronounced wage inflation? Is that was the question was?\nStephanie Moore: Yes, I apologize. That is correct.\nCraig Safian: So I think and Gene will hop in here too, I think we have a great associated brand out in the market, especially for sellers, but broadly as well. Sellers know the Gartner brand. Sellers know that Gartner is a very sales focused organization. And so we\u2019re able to really recruit pretty well are very well, I should say, in the market, and we have no problems meeting our needs, and the supply is there for us to be able to keep hiring. I think the wage inflation is just what we\u2019re seeing when we look at our, our competitors for talent. And we do lots of surveys and we have a lot of market data. And we\u2019re basically just keeping track with the market or keeping pace with the market to make sure that in addition to the great associated value proposition that we have, that we\u2019re actually paying our people at market as well as. Gene you want to add anything?\nGene Hall: But again, if you look at where the highest wage inflation is, it\u2019s in countries where inflation is very high. like Turkey, for example, but a small sales force in Turkey and wage inflation is higher there than it is in, like the U.S., for example. And there\u2019s other countries around the world. So places where it\u2019s the highest or in the countries where overall inflation rates are higher. \nStephanie Moore: Understood, and I guess if we take that further given kind of a step up in hiring, that this certainly this year, does that mean that we should expect potentially a step up and kind of pricing as you look at your contract so the next coming years, understanding that they are multi year just to make up for kind of the investments made this year? Or am I thinking about it incorrectly?\nGene Hall: No, Stephanie I wouldn\u2019t think about it that way. Yes, I would think about the catch up hiring we\u2019re doing is basically really to fulfill all the growth that will be sold in 2021 and 2022. And make sure that we can serve and grow that going forward. The pricing is really there as an offset to the wage inflation. So we as Gene mentioned earlier we fell behind in hiring. He talked about, the fact that our CV over the last three years, has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 11% and our headcount only grown at a compound annual growth rate of 5%. And we had some catching up to do, again, to make sure that we can really provide amazing service to our clients, and then grow them over time as well. And so that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about the catch up hiring. The price increase is really just to offset wage inflation.\nStephanie Moore: Understood, and then maybe taking more of a medium term and long term, longer term question here. And I appreciate the color that you gave on the underlying EBITDA margin improving over time just efficiency of an or leverage of the hiring. Could you maybe talk about other investments we might see from just an overall sales force productivity standpoint as we kind of look over the next several years?\nGene Hall: Hey Stephanie so we could we invest across our business and the economics and cap and the bars and stuff we\u2019ve talked about includes those investments. We do a lot of investment in business. We have invested in new internal systems, things like billings so that we can build up best faster and collect faster so our cash flow is higher. And it\u2019s also easier for our sales force to generate orders and bills, things like that. We constantly invest in new product features. We have a wide variety of products that are tailored for specific roles. And we constantly improve those product offerings to provide continuously more value to our clients, which can help strengthen retention rates and growth in your business over time. And so we are continuing to invest in those kinds of areas in our business to make sure we support future growth. With all those investments are embedded in the normalized margins that Craig referred to.\nOperator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to Gene Hall for closing remarks.\nGene Hall: To summarize today\u2019s call for the third quarter we\u2019d really another strong performance across the business, achieve double digit growth in contract value revenue EBITDA and EPS with strong growth in all practices, all industry sectors across every size client and in every region. We\u2019ve caught up on hiring and a position to deliver sustained future growth. Our underlying margins are in the low 20s comfortably above pre-pandemic levels, and we expect them to modestly increase over time. We\u2019ll continue to generate significant free cash flow and excess net income. We will continue to return significant levels of capital to our shareholders. Thanks for joining today and I look forward to updating you again in the new year.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you Gene and good morning. Third quarter results were strong with double digit growth and contract value revenue and adjusted EPS. FX neutral growth was even stronger than our reported results. We also delivered better than planned EBITDA margins, reflecting the strong third quarter, enthusiastic demand for our in person conferences and continued success in balancing cost discipline with investing for future growth we are again increasing our 2022 guidance. Third quarter revenue was $1.3 billion up 15% year-over-year as reported and 20% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69% down 20 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $332 million up 9% year-over-year and up 15% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.41 up 19% and free cash flow in the quarter was $283 million. Research revenue in the third quarter grew 11% year-over-year as reported and 15% on an FX neutral basis driven by our strong contract value growth. Third quarter research contribution margin was 74% modestly below last year. The continued higher than normal contribution margin reflects improved operational effectiveness, increased scale, travel expenses still modestly below our post pandemic expectations and research related headcount with a bit more catch up still to go. Contract value or CV was $4.5 billion at the end of the third quarter up 14.5% versus the prior year. CV growth is always FX neutral. Excluding the impact of exiting Russia, growth for Q3 would have been 14.9%. Quarterly net contract value increase or NCBI was $128 million. Quarterly NCBI is a helpful way to measure contracts value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. The sequential increase in CV of $128 million was driven by the combination of continued strong retention rates and near record new business of almost $250 million similar to the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of 2021. The 14.9% contract value growth was broad based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes, and geographic regions. Our technology practice grew 13% and all of our business practices led by HR and supply chain grew at double digit growth rates. All industry sectors including technology grew at double digit rates, with the fastest growth in transportation, retail and manufacturing. We had double digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories with our medium category growing the fastest. In the small category, the technology sector continued to grow at double digit rates. We also drove double digit growth across all of our top 10 countries other than China, where we saw continued single digit growth. Across our North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions, all industry sectors had double digit growth rates. Global Technology sales contract value was $3.5 billion at the end of the third quarter up 13% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCBI of $88 million driven by strong retention and near record levels of new business for a third quarter. While retention for GTS was again strong at 107% for the quarter up about 310 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business was down 5% versus last year up against another tough compare. The two year compound annual growth rate was about 9%. GTS quota bearing headcount was up 16% compared to September of last year. Our continued investments in our sales teams will drive long term sustained double digit growth. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global Business sales contract value was $977 million at the end of the third quarter of 21% year-over-year which is above the high end of our medium term outlook of 12 to 16% GBS. CV increased $40 million from the second quarter, while retention for GBS was 114% for the quarter, up about 120 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 1% compared to last year against the strong compare. The two year compound annual growth rate for new business was 18%. GBS quarter bearing headcount increased 19% year-over-year. Headcount we hire in 2022 will help to position us for sustained double digit growth in the future. As with GTS our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the third quarter was $77 million ahead of our expectations as attendees and exhibitors were excited to get back to the in person experience. Contribution margin in the quarter was 52%. We held 10 in person conferences and three virtual conferences in the quarter. We held meetings in both virtual and in person formats. We plan to run nine in person destination conferences in the fourth quarter and have updated our guidance to reflect the strong demand we are seeing. Third quarter consulting revenues increased by 13% year-over-year to $107 million. On an FX neutral basis revenues were up 21%. Consulting contribution margin was 35% in the third quarter up 210 basis points versus the prior year with better than expected revenue and higher utilization rates. Labor base revenues were $90 million up 16% versus Q3 of last year and up 26% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at September 30 was $162 million increasing 33% year-over-year on an FX basis with another strong bookings quarter. The inclusion of multiyear contracts in our backlog calculation, a change we described earlier in the year contributed about 11 percentage points to the year-over-year growth rate. Our contract optimization business declined three percentage reported and 1% on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services increased 16% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and 21% on an FX neutral basis. The biggest drivers of the increase were higher headcount to support our continued strong growth and the return to in person destination conferences. SG&A increased 20% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported, and 24% on an FX neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of added headcount for sales and G&A functions and higher commissions following a strong CV growth in 2021. We expect SG&A expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue over the near term as our catch up hiring continues. EBITDA for the third quarter was $332 million, up 9% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 15% FX neutral. Third quarter EBITDA upside for guidance reflected revenue exceeding our forecasts and expenses at the low end of our expectations. Depreciation in the third quarter of $23 million was down modestly versus 2021. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $29 million, done a little over $1 million versus the third quarter of 2021 mainly due to lower interest rate swaps costs. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q3 adjusted tax rate which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 24.7% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust that income was 20.2% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.41 growth of 19% year-over-year. The average share count for the third quarter was 80 million shares. This is a reduction of about 4.7 million shares or about 5.6% year-over-year. We exited the third quarter with about 80 million shares outstanding on an un-weighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $315 million down 9% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $32 million up about $18 million year-over-year led by increases in capitalized technology labor costs and catch up laptop spend. Free cash flow for the quarter was $283 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. As many of -- we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income. Our conversion from EBITDA is very strong with the differences between cash interest, cash taxes and modest CapEx partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows. Adjusting for the insurance proceeds we received last year free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 19% on a rolling four quarter basis. On the same basis free cash flow is 76% of EBITDA and 137% of GAAP net income. At the end of the third quarter we had $529 million of cash. Our September 30 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt for trailing 12 month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.5 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased more than $1 billion worth of stock through the end of the third quarter. We had about $600 million remaining on our authorization at the end of September, which we expect the board will continue to refresh as needed going forward. Since the end of 2020 through the end of this September, we've reduced our shares outstanding by 10 million shares. This is a reduction of 11%. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is a creative to earnings per share, and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are increasing our full year guidance to reflect strong Q3 performance and an improved outlook for the fourth quarter despite incremental FX headwinds. We now expect an FX impact or full year revenue growth rates of about 420 basis points for the full year. This is up from 370 basis points based on rates when we guided in August. As we discussed the last three quarters 2021 research performance benefited from several factors including QBH tenure mix, NCVI phasing within the quarters and year, record retention rates and strong non-subscription growth. The growth compares will continue to be challenging for a few more quarters. We continue to take a measured approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we've reflected in the updated guidance. For conferences we assume we will be able to run all nine in person conferences as planned. Consistent with our commentary the past couple of quarters, our assumptions for consolidated expenses continue to reflect significant headcount increases during the fourth quarter to support current and future growth. We continue to model higher labor costs and T&E teeny well above 2021 levels as we've previously indicated. We also have higher commission expense during 2022 due to the exceptional performance we delivered in 2021. Finally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. Our updated guidance for 2022 is as follows. We expect research revenue of at least $4.58 billion, which is FX neutral growth of about 16%. The FX neutral growth is up about 60 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong NCVI performance in the third quarter. We expect conferences revenue of at least $375 million, which is growth of about 84% FX neutral. We expect consulting revenue of at least $450 million, which is growth about 14% FX neutral. The result is an outlet for consolidated revenue of at least $5.40 billion, which is FX neutral growth of almost 19%. The FX neutral growth is up about 180 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong performance in third quarter and improved outlook for Q4. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since August, our revenue outlook would have been about $85 million higher than previous guidance. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.36 billion, up $125 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since August, our EBITDA guidance would have been about $136 million higher than previous guidance. We now expect 2022 adjusted EPS at least $10.06 per share. For 2022 we now expect free cash flow at least 1.0 to $5 billion. Our EPS guidance is based on 81 million shares, which reflects year-to-date repurchases. As a result, we expect to deliver at least $310 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2022. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Our strong performance in 2022 continued in the third quarter with momentum across the business. Contract value grew 14%. Adjusted EPS increased 19% fueled in part by the significant reduction of shares over the past year. We are adding associates across the business to keep up with our growth and to position us well heading into 2023. Our continued investments in our teams will drive long term sustained double digit growth. We repurchase more than $1 billion in stock this year through September and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double digit revenue growth with gross margin expansion sales cost growing in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront and we will continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Jeff, good morning. It's Craig. Just a couple of points and then Gene will fill in any blanks. So as Gene mentioned, we did fall behind in terms of our headcount hiring across the business, but probably most notably in GTS over the course of 2021, especially as that segments, CV really accelerated. And so a lot of what we were doing, starting in the first three quarter of \u201821, and through the first three quarters of this year is catching up and filling open territories. And the open territory challenge and opportunity was a little exacerbated by the accelerated growth. And we had to promote more people than we normally do, as we've talked about in previous quarters at the beginning of the year which put even more of an emphasis on making sure that we were recruiting and growing our primary hire face. And so to think about it, and again, we talked about this when we did our initial guide for the year as well, which was last year, we had the benefit of the most, the highest proportion of tenured sellers that we've ever had, obviously, this year is reversed. And as we roll into next year, we expect it to be more \u201cnormal\u201d like we've seen historically. And so the all those dynamics are at play as well and again, as you think about Gene's comment earlier on, we're catching up, but we're also making sure that we are seeding the ground with investments so that we can sustain our double digit growth into the future. Good morning, Toni. Thanks for the question. So, it's been great to return to in person conferences. And as we've said the past few quarters and Gene referenced some large October conferences as well. We've had exhibitors and attendees really enthusiastically returned, which is awesome. And the conferences are hugely valuable to everyone who goes and its super valuable to the entire Gartner franchise. As we look towards 2023 and again, we'll give guidance in February around the full calendar of \u201823 conferences, etc. We're not going to be anywhere near the 70 conferences, destination conferences that we delivered in 2019. We are carefully building back up. Our goal over the long term is to have a conference for every major function that we cover in every major geography in which we do business. But we can't just snap our fingers and be there. It takes time to build those up and to re-launch that. And so we are taking a measured approach to doing that. We're going to be as aggressive as we can, but we're going to be nowhere near the 70 conferences that we ran in 2019 pre-pandemic. Good morning, Andrew. It's Craig. Yes, so we're obviously orders of magnitude lower than 2019 by design, and that's the way we're going to run it going forward. I would say Q3 is almost back to where we think the new normal should be. So Q3 and Q4 will be pretty close to the new normal. But also recognizing that as we roll out more conferences, as we travel to see our global teams, etc there might be a little bit more lift in the travel number, but not order of magnitude lift. We feel pretty good about where we are, again, there's probably a little bit more uplift that we'll see in travel rolling into next year, but Q3 and Q4 are roughly indicative of what we expect moving forward. Good morning Seth it's Craig. So I agree with your assertion on the pricing. So rolling into this year, we were a little bit more aggressive than we normally have been. So we've typically been in the 3% to 4% range this year thinking the five-ish to 6% range, in terms of overall price increase, similar rolling into next year. Price increase actually went effective today for most of our clients and sellers around the world. And we haven't seen much friction or pushback from clients on that. Obviously, it is a more inflationary environment. Our costs are going up roughly in that range and we're roughly pricing to offset that. In terms of the multiyear comment I think our sales teams do a fantastic job of articulating the value that we can deliver over the short term, over the medium term and over the long term. And they've done a fantastic job of continuing to get our clients to sign up for multiyear contracts. So we haven't really seen a step back in that from clients either. No, I wouldn't read anything into it. I'd say on a year-to-day basis, we're over a billion dollars in share repurchases over the last seven quarters, it's 2.6-ish billion dollars of share repurchases, it remains our primary use of capital going forward and we'll bump up or bump down from time to time from quarter to quarter. But over the long over the last seven quarters, we've obviously returned a lot of capital to shareholders through our repurchase programs. And moving forward, we expect return a lot of capital for our shareholders or repurchase programs. Yes, absolutely. And Gene feel free to fill in any blanks here as well. So as Gene mentioned in his prepared remarks and as we have been saying, for the last couple of quarters, we now believe the underlying metrics, the underlying margin of the business is in the low 20s, which is obviously comfortably and well above pre-pandemic levels of EBITDA margins. I think there are a number of factors that have allowed us to increase that outlook as we've gotten comfortable with the way the business is running and the way we're running the business. Most notably, I would say, is one as Gene mentioned, we're going to grow our CV base about four to five or five to six points faster than we grow our quarter bearing hires. That allows us to essentially fix our cost of sale, if you will, or not dilute our margins through cost of sale. We can get gross margin leverage just by virtue of research being our biggest and most profitable segment and we can get a little G&A leverage as well going forward. On top of that with GBS we were starting to see or we're seeing returns on the investments that we made in 2017 and 2018. And we now have much more scale in that business. There is still a lot of scale to be gained in GBS but obviously, we're orders of magnitude higher in our contract values, and we were pre-pandemic. And so again and then there are other things like real estate and travel, where we just gotten smarter around the way we run our business, which have also helped us to raise our expectation on what the underlying margins of the business are. Clearly we've done a lot of hiring through the course of 2022, as Gene mentioned, and we've said multiple times, most of that was catch up hiring from all the growth we delivered in 2021 and 2022. Obviously, those costs roll into \u201823, which is why we're stating and sticking to the fact that our underlying margins are in the low 20s. And that we can grow our business at double digit growth rates moving forward, and we can modestly improve those margins over time as well. We haven't changed our pricing on multiyear approach, or multiyear contracts, the pricing approach has remained the same. And we saw, and it was broad, based across Europe and North America from an industry and size perspective. So there's really nothing to point to in terms of softness. It's the average growth for GTS and overall for GTS is around 13%, and overall, around 14%. And when you peel back the onion, it's pretty close to that at lower levels, whether you live regionally industry, by size, etc. So I think and Gene will hop in here too, I think we have a great associated brand out in the market, especially for sellers, but broadly as well. Sellers know the Gartner brand. Sellers know that Gartner is a very sales focused organization. And so we're able to really recruit pretty well are very well, I should say, in the market, and we have no problems meeting our needs, and the supply is there for us to be able to keep hiring. I think the wage inflation is just what we're seeing when we look at our, our competitors for talent. And we do lots of surveys and we have a lot of market data. And we're basically just keeping track with the market or keeping pace with the market to make sure that in addition to the great associated value proposition that we have, that we're actually paying our people at market as well as. Gene you want to add anything?"

            "content": "Good morning. Thanks for joining us. We continue to deliver incredible value to more than 15,000 enterprises around the world. This led to another strong performance in the third quarter. We achieved double digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS. We have strong growth in all practices, all industry sectors, across every size plant and in every region. In addition, through Q3, we repurchased over a billion dollars of stock. Our clients continue to face a rapidly changing world, things like digital transformation, future of work, high inflation, shifting customer needs, supply chain disruptions, and more. Our clients know they need help on these issues. And they know Gartner is the best source of help. Through our actual objective insights we help executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions achieve their mission critical priorities. We know how to help whether our clients are thriving, struggling, or somewhere in between. With all of this demand for our services remain strong. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segments. Total research revenue grew 15%. Contract value growth was 14%. We serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global technology Sales or GTS serves leaders and their teams within IT. We help chief information officers achieve mission critical priorities, such as leading digital transformations, financing talent and challenging labor market and fueling innovation. GTS contract value group 13%. Global business sales or GBS service leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. We help leaders across these functions achieve their mission critical priorities. For example, we help HR leaders engage employees in a hybrid world, evolve organizational design with the transition to digital business, manage compensation in an inflationary environment, manage employee expectations on divisive social issues, and re-imagine the future of work. GBS contract valued grew 21%. Across GTS and GBS were driving relentless execution of proven practices, which in turn is driving our sustained results. Gartner conferences delivered valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. We continued our returns in person conferences. In October, we hosted two of our flagship conferences, IT symposium and Reimagine HR both in Orlando, Florida. Compared to 2019 attendance in IT symposium was up 12% and Reimagine HR attendance doubled. The feedback from our in person conferences has been resoundingly positive. Gartner consulting is an extension of Gartner research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project based work. Consulting revenue grew 21% in the third quarter. Over the past few quarters the rapid growth of our business outpaced hiring. This quarter our associate base grew 18% year-over-year. This provides the capacity we need to serve our rapidly growing base of licensed users and positions us for sustained future growth. In closing, Gartner delivered another strong performance. We've caught up on hiring in our position to deliver sustained future growth. Our underlying margins are in the low 20s comfortably above pre-pandemic levels. We expect them to modestly increase over time. We'll continue to generate significant free cash flow in excess net income and will continue to return significant levels of capital to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Jeff, it's Gene. So the 18% associated growth that talked about on the call is largely catch up hiring. If you look over the last three years or so we had very robust growth in our business. And our hiring lag behind that give you a flavor for the compound growth rate or sub contract value was about 11%. And the compound growth rate of headcount was about 5.5%. And so it lagged a lot we got behind. The good news is that we're as of Q3, end of Q3 we are almost fully caught up. And so we expect to see not the same rate of hiring as we go into Q4 next year, we expect to normalize more which we've done traditionally, which is to have our headcount growth, have CV grow about five or six points higher than actual headcount growth going forward. Hey Toni, it's Gene. So our new business was at an all time high. So just to be clear, wasn't like it was not a good compared to business acumen for dollars was at an all time high, it was near an all time high. Secondly, the fact that it's impacting new business the most that Craig talked about in terms of the proportion of our sales force, it is tenured versus non-tenured. Last year, we had, as Craig mentioned, the highest proportion of tenured salespeople that we have on record. This year, because of promotions and growth hiring, we had among the lowest proportion of tenured salespeople on record. And a tenured salesperson sells whole number multiples higher, more in new business than a non-tenured salesperson. The productivity accelerates rapidly during the salespersons first three years. And that's the primary factor that impacted our business in Q3. Hey Andrew. So during the quarter, I would say was typical, with September being slightly stronger than with a little bit more acceleration during the quarter than you might normally see. But within a small range, call it overall a pretty normal quarter. So we're focused on ending the year of double digit in a quarter bearing headcount, again, really making sure that we're set up to roll into 2023 with full territories and a more tenured sales force etc. There can obviously be a lot of puts and takes, but what I'd say is we expect to end the year for both GTS and GBS with strong double digit quarter bearing hires growth on a year-over-year basis. So Jeff, good morning. No, not really. I think we lead with multiyear contracts as sort of the de facto standard. That's generally what our clients want, because they're missing critical priorities, are not bounded by a 12 month contract or something like that. And so we've seen real no change in the selling environment, or the selling motion around the price increase we've talked about earlier as well as our contracted vehicles. So as Craig mentioned, both North America and Europe had double digit growth in the third quarter. I think the way to think about it is that we want to make sure that our cost of sale, if you will, so sales cost as a percent of CV or percent of revenue remain roughly fixed. And we believe we can do that by having CV growth at whatever that is or whatever we deliver, and toggling the amount of headcount growth so that we keep our cost of sale roughly fixed. If CV is growing 20% then yes, we would grow headcount yes close to 15%. Is CV we're growing 10% we would probably, we would toggle down the growth investment to again, lock in, roughly lock in that overall cost of sale. And so this is a pivot we made in the second half of 2019 as we shifted to really wanted to make sure that we got returns on the investments we're making, and managed the sales portion of our overall margin. I think the one difference that you point to, which is the gap between CV growth and headcount growth is really just driven by what we're seeing from a wage inflation perspective. And so when it was three to four point gap, that's because that that's what we were seeing from wage inflation perspective. Now, we're obviously seeing a little bit greater. So we're just dialing that into our growth algorithm to make sure that we account for it. Yes, absolutely. So the SG&A comment is more of a near term comment. So as we are catching up on the hiring and you get [Audio Gap] just think about high teens growth we're seeing in both GTS and GBS. Obviously, that rolls into next year, because we, the hiring was really concentrated in the back half of the year. And so that will put pressure on the cost of sale and margin as designed into 2023. So it's more of a near term comment. In terms of the other things we're seeing again, we talked about the growing sales force a little bit, or growing to be a little bit faster than we're growing the sales force, etc. That is more in a steady state, obviously, 2022 as we indicated at the beginning of the year, and we have indicated each quarter, as we move through the year, there was a lot of catch up happening in 2022. And that obviously impacts 2023. We believe, again, that the underlying margins for the business are in the low 20s. And that through the combination of the investments we're making, the size of the market opportunity opportunities in productivity, etc, that we can grow the business, the top line at double digit growth rates, and modestly expand margins from that underlying margin in the low 20s. Hey, good morning, Stephanie. We had a little trouble hearing you. I think what you asked was just provide a little bit more color around our hiring trends and where we may be seeing more pronounced wage inflation? Is that was the question was? But again, if you look at where the highest wage inflation is, it's in countries where inflation is very high. like Turkey, for example, but a small sales force in Turkey and wage inflation is higher there than it is in, like the U.S., for example. And there's other countries around the world. So places where it's the highest or in the countries where overall inflation rates are higher. No, Stephanie I wouldn't think about it that way. Yes, I would think about the catch up hiring we're doing is basically really to fulfill all the growth that will be sold in 2021 and 2022. And make sure that we can serve and grow that going forward. The pricing is really there as an offset to the wage inflation. So we as Gene mentioned earlier we fell behind in hiring. He talked about, the fact that our CV over the last three years, has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 11% and our headcount only grown at a compound annual growth rate of 5%. And we had some catching up to do, again, to make sure that we can really provide amazing service to our clients, and then grow them over time as well. And so that's the way we're thinking about the catch up hiring. The price increase is really just to offset wage inflation. Hey Stephanie so we could we invest across our business and the economics and cap and the bars and stuff we've talked about includes those investments. We do a lot of investment in business. We have invested in new internal systems, things like billings so that we can build up best faster and collect faster so our cash flow is higher. And it's also easier for our sales force to generate orders and bills, things like that. We constantly invest in new product features. We have a wide variety of products that are tailored for specific roles. And we constantly improve those product offerings to provide continuously more value to our clients, which can help strengthen retention rates and growth in your business over time. And so we are continuing to invest in those kinds of areas in our business to make sure we support future growth. With all those investments are embedded in the normalized margins that Craig referred to. To summarize today's call for the third quarter we'd really another strong performance across the business, achieve double digit growth in contract value revenue EBITDA and EPS with strong growth in all practices, all industry sectors across every size client and in every region. We've caught up on hiring and a position to deliver sustained future growth. Our underlying margins are in the low 20s comfortably above pre-pandemic levels, and we expect them to modestly increase over time. We'll continue to generate significant free cash flow and excess net income. We will continue to return significant levels of capital to our shareholders. Thanks for joining today and I look forward to updating you again in the new year."

Thanks for joining us. Gartner had a strong performance in the second quarter. We delivered double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS, and we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders through our buyback programs. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segments. Gartner Research provides actual objective insight to executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our expert guidance and tools enable faster, smarter decisions and stronger performance on our client's mission-critical priorities. We continue to have a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies and we're delivering more value than ever. The rate of change in the world is the fastest I've ever seen. Against this backdrop, Gartner continues to get even more agile. We're generating new insights to address timely impressing issues, such as leveraging and emerging technologies, optimizing costs, attracting and retaining talent in a hybrid world, managing cybersecurity risk and more. We deliver incredible value whether our clients are thriving, struggling, or somewhere in between. As a result, demand for our services remain strong. Q2 research revenue were 17% in the second quarter, total contract value growth was 15%, retention remained very strong. A new business was near all-time highs. We're also growing our sales teams. Global technology sales headcount was up 9% and global business sales headcount was up 17% year-over-year. Global Technology Sales or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS contract value grew 14%. Global business sales or GBS serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal, and more. GBS contract value grew 23%. Across every function, IT, supply chain, marketing, sales, HR, finance, and more, leaders and their teams benefit from our incredible value proposition. As a result, the enterprises we support see measurable progress on their mission-critical priorities. Leveraging the extraordinary value of our research insights, our conferences business brings the power of Gartner to life for an engaged and highly qualified audience. During Q2, we delivered our first in-person destination conferences since the start of the pandemic. These conferences covered IT, finance and supply chain in Europe, Australia, and the U.S. Attendee feedback has been resoundingly positive. They deeply value the opportunities to connect, engage, and learn in-person. Bookings continue at a strong pace for both exhibitors and attendees. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic technology initiatives through deeper extended project based work. Consulting had a strong quarter with revenue up 20%. Bookings were also strong, driving backlog up 45%. In closing, we saw strong growth across the business. We continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. We returned excess capital to shareholders, which reduced our shares outstanding. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for strong double-digit top line growth. Our underlying margins are in the low 20s, well above pre-pandemic levels, and we expect them to modestly increase over time. And we continue to generate free cash flow well in excess of earnings, which we will deploy to further drive shareholder value. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Craig?\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter results were strong with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue and adjusted EPS. With results above our expectations, we are again increasing our 2022 guidance. The improved outlook reflects the better than expected second quarter top line results, strong demand for second half conferences and a successful balance between cost discipline and investing for future growth. Second quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, up 18% year-over-year as reported and 22% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, down 70 basis points versus the prior year as costs returned towards normal. EBITDA was $389 million, up 10% year-over-year and up 14% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.85, up 27% and free cash flow in the quarter was $395 million. Adjusting for insurance proceeds received last year, free cash flow was down 2% year-over-year for the quarter and up 5% on a rolling full quarter basis. Research revenue in the second quarter grew 14% year-over-year as reported and 17% on an FX neutral basis, driven by our strong contract value growth. Second quarter research contribution margin was 74% about in line with 2021. Higher than normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, increased scale, continued temporary avoidance of travel expenses and continuing to catch up on headcount to support the research business. Contract value or CV was $4.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 15% versus the prior year. As we discussed previously, CV reflects our decision to exit the Russian market, which contributed about $13 million in the second quarter 2021 number. This reduced the headline growth by about 40 basis points. Quarterly net contract value increased or NCVI was $97 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. The sequential increase in CV of $97 million was driven by the combination of continued strong retention rates and near record new business of close to $250 million. We saw a broad based CV growth across all of our practices. Our technology practice grew 14% and all of our business practices grew at double-digit growth rates with many of them growing more than 20% year-over-year. From an industry perspective, retail, media and manufacturing led our CV growth. Global technology sales contract value was $3.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 14% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $60 million, driven by strong retention and near record levels of new business for a second quarter. While retention for GTS was 107% for the quarter, up about 530 basis points year-over-year and near record levels. GTS new business was down 1% versus last year up, against the very tough compare. The two-year compound annual growth rate was about 16%. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 9% year-over-year. We are on track to get to double-digit growth by the end of 2022, as we have successfully brought turnover down and/or investments in recruiting are delivering results. We will continue to invest in our sales team to drive long-term sustained double-digit growth while also delivering strong margins. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global business sales contract value was $936 million at the end of the second quarter, up 23% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $37 million from the first quarter. While retention for GBS was 115% for the quarter, up about five percentage points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 3% compared to last year, reflecting robust growth across the full portfolio and against the very strong compare. The two-year compound annual growth rate for new business was 35%. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased 17% year-over-year, headcount we hire in 2022 will help to position us for sustained double-digit growth in the future. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $114 million, ahead of our expectations as attendees and exhibitors enthusiastically return to in-person. Contribution margin in the quarter was 65%. We held six in-person conferences and eight virtual conferences in the quarter. We held event meetings in both virtual and in-person formats. We planned to run 19 in-person conferences for the balance of the year. Second quarter consulting revenues increased by 14% year-over-year to $121 million, on an FX neutral basis revenues were up 20%. Consulting contribution margin was 42% in the second quarter up 120 basis points versus the prior year with better than expected revenue, higher utilization rates and a mixed benefit from strong growth in contract optimization. Labor-based revenues were $95 million up 11% versus Q2 of last year and up 18% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at June 30th was $152 million, increasing 45% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with another strong bookings quarter. The inclusion of multi-year contracts, a change we described last quarter contributed about 12 percentage points the year-over-year growth rate. Our contract optimization business was up 28% as reported and 31% on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly valuable. Consolidated cost of services increased 21% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 25% on an FX neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth and the return to in-person destination conferences SG&A increased 24% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 27% on an FX neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of increased hiring in sales and G&A functions, higher commission expense, following strong CV growth in 2021 and a $12 million one-time real estate charge. We expect SG&A expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue over the near term as our catch up hiring continues. EBITDA for the second quarter was $389 million up 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 14% FX neutral. Second quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our forecast and expenses at the low -end of our expectations. Depreciation in the quarter of $23 million was down modestly versus 2021. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $29 million up $2 million versus the second quarter of 2021 due to an increase in total debt balances. The Q2 adjusted tax rate which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income was 25.7% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $2.85, growth of 27% year-over-year. The average share count for the second quarter was 81 million shares. This is a reduction of about $5.6 million shares or about 6.5% year-over-year. We exited the second quarter with about 80 million shares outstanding on an unweighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $416 million. Adjusting for the insurance proceeds we received in the second quarter of 2021, operating cash flow was down 2% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $21 million up 76% year-over-year as a result of an increase in capitalized software, laptops and other infrastructure. Free cash flow for the quarter was $395 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. As many of you know, we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income, our conversion from EBITDA is very strong with the differences being cash interest, cash taxes and modest CapEx, partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows. Adjusting for the insurance proceeds we received last year, free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 21% on a rolling four quarter basis. On the same basis, free cash flow was 81% of EBITDA and 146% of GAAP net income. At the end of the second quarter, we had $360 million of cash. Our June 30th debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. We repurchased around 930 million of stock through the first half of this year. We had about 700 million remaining on our authorization at the end of June. We expect the board to continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. Since the end of 2020 through the end of this June, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 9 million shares. This is a reduction of 11%. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combining with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. Our medium-term outlook is for double digit revenue growth, while margins have been very strong the past two years we are continuing to catch up hiring and to resume travel spending. We estimate our underlying margins to be in the low twenties, well above pre-pandemic levels, and we expect them to increase modestly over time. We will give 2023 specific guidance in February consistent with our usual practice. Strong top line growth, modest margin expansion, low capital intensity, and working capital as a source of cash will allow us to deliver strong free cash flow now and in the future. We are increasing our full year guidance to reflect strong Q2 performance and an improved outlook for the second half despite incremental FX headwinds. We now expect an FX impact to our revenue growth rates of above 370 basis points for the full year. This is up from 260 basis points based on rates when we guided in May. As we discussed the last two quarters, 2021 research performance benefited from several factors, including QBH tenure mix, NCVI phasing within the quarters and the year, record retention rates and strong non-subscription growth. We continue to assume that those benefits do not persist at the same levels through 2022. The growth compares will continue to be challenging as we move through the year. We continue to take a measured approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we've reflected in the updated guidance. For conferences, we assume we will be able to run all the in-person conferences as planned. Consistent with our commentary the past couple of quarters, our assumptions for consolidated expenses continue to reflect significant headcount increases during the year to support current and future growth. We have modeled higher labor costs, T&E well above 2021 levels as we've previously indicated. We also have higher commission expense during 2022 due to the very good selling performance we delivered in 2021. Finally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. Our updated guidance for 2022 is as follows. We expect research revenue of at least $4.575 billion, which is FX neutral growth of about 15%. The FX neutral growth is up about 120 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong NCVI performance in the second quarter. We expect conferences revenue of at least $335 million, which is growth of about 63% FX neutral. We expect consulting revenue of at least $440 million, which is growth of about 11% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.35 billion, which is FX neutral growth of almost 17%. The FX neutral growth is up about 290 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong performance in the second quarter. Without the strengthening U.S. dollars since May, our revenue guidance would've been about $138 million than previous guidance. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.235 billion up $100 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since May, our EBITDA guidance would've been about $120 million higher than previous guidance. We now expect 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $8.85. For 2022 we now expect free cash flow of at least $985 million. Our guidance is based on 81 million shares outstanding, which reflects year-to-date repurchases. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our investor relations site. Finally, for the third quarter of 2022, we expect to deliver at least $255 million of EBITDA. Our strong performance in 2022 continued in the second quarter with momentum across the business. Contract value growth was very strong at 15%. Adjusted EPS grew 27% fueled by the significant reduction in shares over the past year. We repurchased around $930 million in stock this year through June and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales cost growing in line with CV growth and G&A leverage we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us up front. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck in M&A. With that I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from Jeff Meuler with Baird, your line is now open.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah, thanks. Just first a clarifying question on the underlying margin. So when you say low twenties, could that include like 21% or 22%, you're not saying like low 20.X% and if we will have a recession at some point, would you expect to be able to at least maintain those underlying margins through a recession again as well?\nCraig Safian: Hey, good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the questions, in terms of the underlying margin. No, it wasn't locked in on 20.0% as low twenties. As we've looked at the business over the last few years we've learned a lot through the pandemic, et cetera. And so we're now comfortable that the underlying margins of the business are in the low twenties. And again, we can grow the top line double digit growth rates into the future and we can modestly expand margins from that point as well. In terms of \u2013 yeah, go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah. I was just going to say, including maintain at least that margin in a recession.\nCraig Safian: Yeah. So that was the second part of the question. So again, the way we are thinking about running the business is again, we believe that there still is a huge untapped market opportunity. We believe one of the ways that we go capture that untapped market opportunity is by continuing to grow the sales force and again making sure we've got the right insights and the right number of analyst and advisors, et cetera. If there were to be recessionary impact on the business, we would toggle the investment growth rates in each of those areas to ensure that we could deliver those underlying margins and also ensure that we could drive modest margin expansion into the future as well.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. And then I think you're being anticipatory on the commentary around the new business, giving us the two year CAGRs and such, but just any comments on what you're seeing in real time from a macro perspective, whether it's pipeline build and conversion in June and July or the topics of client content demand, just any other business kind of metrics just given the \u201cnear-record\u201d when we \u2013 I guess, used to fresh records from the growth company that Gartner is?\nGene Hall: Hi Jeff, it\u2019s Gene. So the selling environment has been quite I think stable and good compared to Q1. Again, as you said we had near record new business levels. We have near record retention levels. Our conferences booking for both the exhibitors and attendees was very strong and that's been reflected in our guidance going forward, I believe the consulting business had one of the best quarters we've ever had with revenues of 20%, backlog up 45%. And there's kind of nothing, if we look under the covers that that would lead you to believe in Q2, there isn\u2019t anything other than selling and growth was quite robust.\nCraig Safian: And Jeff, I would just echo having read briefly your report earlier this morning the compares are super tough in Q2 and they remain pretty tough throughout the balance of the year. We're still growing CV at a great growth rate. You heard some of the other metrics around their underlying businesses in conferences and consulting as well and so very tough compares for the balance of this year, but still feel good about the momentum of the business.\nJeff Meuler: Yep. Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I guess on the topic as you are in terms of what happens in the downturn, can you talk a little bit more about how your business today is more resilient in a downturn when you look back to I guess other periods of macro decline, maybe COVID crisis or even going further back the financial crisis and kind of how you feel about the sales line going into something potentially happening near-term.\nGene Hall: Hi, Heather, it\u2019s Gene. So we're very cognizant, always of the environment around us, and we try to make sure that we're as a business prepared for where the world is going and clearly being concerned about a macroeconomic downturn, one of those things. And first thing is, at any given point in time, we have clients that are growing clients that are shrinking and clients in between. So we always have clients that are struggling. What we see in a macroeconomic downturn is just more of those clients, but we do it all the time. Now, as I mentioned earlier, we've constantly adjust to try and make sure we are prepared for whatever economic environment comes. And we do this in a number of ways. One of them is we actually do surveys for our clients to understand kind of where their mindset is, what they're concerned about. In fact, in July, we did a survey of more than 150 Chief Financial Officers of our clients to see what was on their mind and therefore how she respond. And they have three priorities. One was securing talent, they're still seeing that it's hard to hire talent, and they're concerned about the wages for those talent. The second one is they want to keep accelerating digital, even in downturn. In fact, we asked these CFOs, what are they going to do in the downturn? 69% said, they're going to continue to increase spending on technology to downturn, 28% said they're going to maintain it and 3% said, they're going to decrease it. So this continued investment technology to prove the economics of business continues on. And the third priority was to manage spending on things like operations, real estate, travel, to pay to hire people and pay higher wages as well as to do these investments in digital. So what we're doing is we're taking our research content and line it with those kinds of priorities, help the clients, making sure they secure talent and manage with inflation, making sure they can continue to accelerate the digital impact on their business. And thirdly, most important maybe helping them to manage spend that's a big part of our business all the time. And we recently updated our, what we call cost optimization work to make sure we can help them with it. So we've updated our research based on, and I gave you the CFO survey. We do surveys all three level executives understand what their individual priorities are. We then update our research, make sure it's on those most construing topics. And then in fact, in July we introduced trainings all our sales people and our service people in terms of what are the most important issues today with clients like the things I just mentioned and how has our research changed so that we can match those fees. And then, we'll continue to do that going forward. And so this wasn't kind of a one-time thing we do once, we do this on an ongoing basis. So part of our strategy is to make sure our content is always on the topics people find important. Now, clearly one of those things is going to be how to manage costs and we will help them with that. But then making sure that all of our sales and service people are equipped to have conversations with senior executives on how we can help them with those priorities. And if this agility is the core part of our business, we also do structural things in our business. Like, if you \u2013 the share of both of your contracts we have is quite high and we first strategy to grow that over time. And so it is those two things making sure our content is great, our sales group preferred and making sure the underlying structural factors we can control are also there. That is, if you look over time, we perform better and better at each downturn. And we're certainly aware it might be a downturn and are preparing for it.\nHeather Balsky: Great. Thanks. Thanks for doing that. And another player, I guess in the space recently mentioned longer contract cycles. Are you seeing anything like that in your market?\nGene Hall: So I'd say we haven't seen longer contracting cycles. I would say we see escalations it's more likely that a contract would be reviewed by a CFO than it was a year ago. Because we train our sales people, should that that's likely to happen and to be prepared for it. And to both prepare our meeting client who might be like the Chief HR Executive and Chief Information Officer that they might have to go to their CFO and review it and make sure they have what we call a CFO ready packet.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. Thank you for answering my question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. The performance in GBS was noticeably stronger than GTS. If you look at CV growth it was 23% GBS, 14% GTS and the, the headcount growth was at 17% of GBS compared to 9% at GTS. Does this difference in growth between the two businesses reflect priorities internally or does it reflect customer demand that might be different between GTS and GBS?\nGene Hall: Yeah. Hey George. I think it reflects the investments that we've made more than anything else. So you go back in fact, go back five years ago, we began investing pretty heavily in areas outside of IT. So I think marketing, supply chain, finance, HR, legal, sales those were areas that hadn't traditionally been strong for us. We were in a couple of them, we hadn\u2019t been strong. We after investments significantly both buying [indiscernible] and then after bought CEB with investments and what we're seeing in the accelerated growth rate in GBS now is the outcome of those investments. We kind of invested up front there's a lot of discussion about it at the time. And we increased sales capacity, increased research capacity, service capacity, developed a lot of content, and we're seeing the benefits of those. And so I think that's the first piece. The second piece is one of the major factors to grow our business. Clearly with this huge market opportunity is growing our sales head count. And while we increase sales productivity, we've had some good increase in productivity. Growing sales headcount is essential. And so the fact that we've grown our GBS head sales headcount faster over time, not with this quarter, but if you look at like over the last since 2019, we've grown our GBS sales headcount at compound growth rate of about 60% a year, I'm sorry about 5% a year. And that is which is faster than GTS, which is about flat. And so that's allowed the growth to be a lot higher in GBS. So those two things, the combination of the investments and the growth in Salesforce is what's really powered the faster CV growth.\nCraig Safian: And the other thing I'd add George is just, as we look at over the medium-term, we believe given the market opportunity and our ability to go capture that market, that both GTS and GBS can be consistent 12% to 16% growers. And so, yes, GBS is growing a little bit ahead of that right now, but we remain very, very, very confident that both GTS and GBS can continue to grow at very strong double digit growth rates.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. Last quarter you increased your normalized EBITDA margin targets from 19% and 20% to 20%. And now you're saying underlying margins will be in the low-twenties. So just going back to clarify, are you increasing your underlying margin target over the medium term or are you reiterating it from the prior quarter?\nCraig Safian: Yeah, it's a great question. So let me attempt to clarify because it is a very important question. So number one, I would say just as context, we can grow our top line at double digit growth rates and modestly expand margins over time. And there is operating leverage in the business at another way, right? So those are kind of two key points. When we were discussing the 20% normalized margin, we were really looking back to 2021 and attempting to give a view on if things had been \u201cmore normal\u201d what would our operating or EBITDA margins, what would they have been in 2021? What we're now providing is more of a go forward view around what do we believe the operating margins are that we can run the business at. And we have moved that higher over time to your point because we've gotten increased visibility into better ways to run our business. And so what is the new normal for travel expenses? What is the new normal for the amount of real estate we need? What does it look like when in-person conferences come back into the portfolio and what does it look like as we catch up on headcount and then continue to grow and invest to support and sustain future growth and so the way to think about that low-twenties number is yes, it's an update but it's also a view towards what do we think the underlying margins of the business are that we can modestly expand on.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nGreg Parrish: Hey, this is Greg Parrish for Toni. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on the strong quarter. Just wanted talk about margin. You ramped up hiring in the quarter a lot margins went up and understand a lot of those probably weren't in the expense space yeah, but just really Craig, if you could kind of help us bridge on how you get to the margin in the back half given the sort of implied step down.\nCraig Safian: Yes, absolutely. So you've hit on a number of the items that will impact the margins in the second half of the year. So we're very aggressive on hiring the first half and we expect to remain as aggressive in the second half as we continue to catch up from hiring from 2021 and we also make sure that we're investing appropriately for the future so that's a big piece that goes into the cost base for the second half of year. The second big thing is resumption of travel. And some of that is tied to us returning to in-person destination conferences, but a lot of it is just normal, we run global teams and we want our leaders to be in front of those global teams and so we'll see that ramp up in the second half of the year as well. Third thing is our normal comp adjustment period happens April 1. So we only have one quarter of that in the first half of the year. We obviously have two quarters of that in the second half of the year. And so those are the three biggies as you think about bridging the expenses. And then the fourth one is with the return to in-person destination conferences. Obviously there's a lot of variable cost in delivering those in-person.\nGreg Parrish: Great. Thanks for the color there. And I guess just a quick follow-up on pricing, I think last quarter, Craig, you talked about getting more this year, given the inflationary environment, I guess, the broad macro is a little bit different than it was three months ago. Are you still expecting sort of above normal pricing this year?\nCraig Safian: Yes, I mean, I think Greg, the way to think about it is we want to make sure that we are matching our price increases with wage inflation or cost inflation. The bulk of our costs are people related. So we feel good that we are matching our price increases with what we're seeing on our wages.\nGreg Parrish: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask a question first on the headcount growth, really solid quarter recorder increase there, I think in your prepared remarks, you touched on it briefly, but I was hoping you could spend a bit more time on attrition trends, how that's kind of coming in relative to your expectations and the successful recruiting efforts. Just a little bit more color there, because it does sound like you're still pretty happy with where that's trending and your goals for the full year?\nGene Hall: Yes, Andrew, great question. So the first in terms of our attrition, we want to retain our great associates. Attrition like many companies went up over the last couple years. We worked hard to understand the causes and then making sure that we address that. And actually our associate turnover has actually gone down now to kind of what we would call normal levels. And so we're very happy with that turnover. In addition to that, we have a very strong recruiting team. We have a truly world-class recruiting team and that recruiting team's been doing a great job and of course we have a great employee value proposition as well. So you combine those three things, lower turnover, a great employee value proposition, a crack recruiting team. That's allowed us to get our net associate headcount growth back up to where we need to support the growth in our business.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you. And then for my follow up, I wanted to ask about strength in the U.S. versus internationally. Obviously, seems like there's pretty broad based growth across the practices and across the industries, but is there any difference in CV growth or how you're kind of able to sell in EMEA for example, given the geopolitical uncertainty or anything to call out there in the court?\nGene Hall: Yes. Hey, there's \u2013 what I say is there's nothing systematic. If you look at Europe, Europe is proceeding along, there's some countries that are doing very well. There's some countries that aren't, and it's sort of typical of what we've seen. And then that is kind of flat and same is true for the rest of the world so nothing really remarkable in terms of U.S. versus different geographic region.\nCraig Safian: Yes, and Andrew, when we say broad based growth, it is broad based. So we look at it across our top 10 geographies, they're all growing at nice growth rates. When we look across industry cuts, they're all growing at nice growth rates. And so, yes, there are always pockets where there may be a little bit of a challenge for us, but generally those are either like super micro challenges or our own operational challenges. But the growth has remained pretty broad based. The biggest indicator where we've been growing and not growing is where a headcount, our sales headcount has grown faster or slower.\nAndrew Nicholas: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nSeth Weber: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking a question. I wanted to just ask another question on the expense side. I appreciate that travel, T&E and stuff like that is ramping up in the second half of the year. Do you think that the run rate by the end of the second year, will kind of get you back to par or do you think there will still be some kind of catch up headwinds into next year? Thanks.\nCraig Safian: Yes, Seth. Good morning. It's a good question. So I think the second half of the year will be more indicative of \u201cnormal travel\u201d, starting off the year, this year, given where we were with the pandemic, it was a little light in the first three or four months of the year and has started to pick back up. And so, yes, second half is probably more indicative. I think the way we're thinking about it is as compared to the last \u201cnormal year\u201d back in 2019 where we expect to spend probably at least 50% less than we did in 2019. And again, we just think that the company and our associate base has embraced and thrived, operating virtually. We still do need to travel, but we don't need to travel at the same volume that we did back in 2019.\nSeth Weber: Got it. Thank you. And then just those follow up I was really surprised at the strength in some of the areas like the non-subscription revenue and then the consulting backlog of 45%. I'm just \u2013 was there anything unusual there, or is that just reflective of kind of what you were talking about earlier that the model is just more consulting backlog of 45% I'm just \u2013 was there anything unusual there, or is that just reflective of kind of what you were talking about earlier that the model is just more recession resistant or resilient than people might expect. And just any comment on those line items, thanks.\nCraig Safian: Yes, Seth, I think it just reflects that our clients had challenges that our clients had challenges that they need help with and then our content and the way we deliver the content was through consulting conferences or research is really helpful in helping them solve the problems. And so I think it's indicative, but we have a great value proposition, just kind of what's going on.\nSeth Weber: Okay. And just the non-subscription revenue, is that \u2013 do you feel like that's a kind of a sustainable level or would you expect that to come off a little bit here going forward?\nCraig Safian: Yes Seth. It is we had a really strong year on that line last year. So tough compares there, which again, we did model into our initial guidance and our updated guides as well, but to Gene's point, the products and offerings we have there offer a very strong and compelling value proposition in good times or rougher times. And so we still expect it to be a nice strong grower for us, but again, super tough compare against the 2021 performance.\nSeth Weber: Got it. Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Ryan on for Jeff. I just had a quick question on the labor supply side. Is it still as tight to find potential employees as it was three months ago?\nGene Hall: Great question, Ryan, what I read in the press and what I see with a lot of other companies is a lot of challenges. I go to the CFO survey. One of the biggest concerns that CFOs have is their ability to hire talent. We've actually found that we've had no trouble hiring talent. Again, our employee value proposition is very strong. We have a great brand with associates and so we've had no trouble hiring people at all. And that's reflected in the hiring results that you saw.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then just to follow up on the prior question, should we look to non-subscription revenues as a leading indicator if we're heading into a downturn?\nGene Hall: No, I don't think so. I mean, it's a relatively small line and it can be a little volatile. Again, I think as we look across, I would look broadly across the business for leading indicators, not one of the smallest revenue lines that we actually have out there. So now I would guide you to look at consulting, look at conferences and look at our research CV growth as leading indicators.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Brendan on for Manav. Just want to ask obviously some of your competitors for talent at least are freezing hiring and you may have an opportunity to catch up on headcount in the next few quarters. As a labor market gets a bit more friendly so for GTS specifically, obviously things are started to improve this quarter. Is this a level where you grow 10% off of or you think you can really catch up the next couple \u2013 over the next few quarters?\nGene Hall: Hey Brendan, it's a great question. I mean our business grew really rapidly last year and more rapidly we've expected and so we had a lot of hiring to catch up on, including in GTS. And so we want to get that catch up hiring so that we can properly service our clients and also be prepared to sell more clients. And over time we expect to grow our GTS sales force and GBS\u2019 by the way, take three to five percentage points slower than our CV growth. So CV growth is 15%, you'd expect to see over time our target would be headcount growth of 12% \u2013 10% to 12% growth.\nCraig Safian: And Brendan, the way to think about that is that's sort of the normal algorithm for how we want to make sure that we are investing for both current needs and future sustained growth. Obviously, this year to Gene's point, we are doing a lot of catching up. And so you'll see those growth rates a little bit higher potentially obviously with GBS up at 17 and we're fully expecting both GTS and GBS to end the year with strong double-digit quota-bearing headcount growth.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And just another question here, but moving over to the conferences, is the guidance increase really, is it just like better attendance than you expected? Are the conferences all full? Is that kind \u2013 is that what it is or is there something else driving that higher?\nGene Hall: Hey, Brendan, so the first piece of it is that we're seeing very, very robust demand for conferences. Exhibitors are finding it in a great way to meet prospects for them. And the attendees find tremendous value, so we're finding just very strong demand for our conferences continuing on. And then I'll let Craig talk about how [indiscernible].\nCraig Safian: Yes. So I think, Brendan, obviously the second quarter, where our first in-person destination conferences in a few years and so we were pretty cautious about our expectations around the number of exhibitors and number of attendees that would want to come, would be able to come. And as you heard in our comments, I think both groups enthusiastically returned in the second quarter. And as Gene mentioned, earlier our bookings leading through our Q3 events and even the advanced bookings on Q4 conferences, look very strong as well. And so the update, the outlook is really just around some caution upfront because we hadn't delivered anything in person in essentially three \u2013 almost three years. And we saw an enthusiastic return from both revenue streams, attendees and our exhibitors.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is actually Stephanie on Hamzah. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the tenure or your GTS sales force today versus pre-pandemic. How much tenure can add to productivity and right now, if you view the GTS sales force productivity is kind of back to those pre-pandemic levels. Thank you.\nGene Hall: Hey Stephanie, great question. So tenure is an important determinant of productivity. When we hire new salesperson, it takes some time to fully get up to speed. And so a more tenure sales person is more productive. We're very focused on both hiring people to get up to speed quickly, as well as having internal training and other systems that help those new sales people get up to speed even faster. If you look at it, because we hired fewer people during the pandemic, the average tenure sales force last year was pretty high. The highest it's been in recent memory, as we ramped up our hiring, in Q2, it was more towards a normal tenure level as we keep hiring, we expect that to drop a bit for the rest of the year again during 2023.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. And then kind of switching gears. Could you talk bit about the M&A environment, how's the pipeline looking today and kind of where your focus is at?\nCraig Safian: Hey Stephanie, good morning. From an M&A perspective, obviously, we've got a team that is actively out there looking at opportunities and staying in touch with a few hundred companies and actually tracking well more than that. I think our strategy as we've articulated is number one, we're an organic growth company and we believe we can achieve our medium term objectives of the double-digit growth and modest margin expansion organically. And so it does not require M&A to get there. That said, we do like to do M&A, when it can fill a gap or catalyze us or add an asset or capability or things like that. So I think as we look at the radar screen, we are looking at things that can catalyze us or fill in gaps or add assets to our portfolio that can help us over the long-term. I think there obviously over the last two or three quarters just like the equity markets has been a recalibration around valuations. I'm not sure every seller has completely recalibrated yet either. But again, we'll continue to be on the lookout for strong strategic value enhancing tuck-in opportunities that again can either catalyze growth, fill in a gap or add important assets for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Gene Hall for closing remarks.\nGene Hall: Well, summarizing today's call. In the second quarter, we drove strong performances across the business, across every geography, every industry, and every major function we deliver incredible value. We have strong demand for services with have a vast untapped market opportunity. We can drive sustained double-digit top line growth. As we invest for the future. We'll continue to return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders to our 2022 guidance. First of all, we increased our 2022 guidance. Thanks for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter results were strong with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue and adjusted EPS. With results above our expectations, we are again increasing our 2022 guidance. The improved outlook reflects the better than expected second quarter top line results, strong demand for second half conferences and a successful balance between cost discipline and investing for future growth. Second quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, up 18% year-over-year as reported and 22% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, down 70 basis points versus the prior year as costs returned towards normal. EBITDA was $389 million, up 10% year-over-year and up 14% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.85, up 27% and free cash flow in the quarter was $395 million. Adjusting for insurance proceeds received last year, free cash flow was down 2% year-over-year for the quarter and up 5% on a rolling full quarter basis. Research revenue in the second quarter grew 14% year-over-year as reported and 17% on an FX neutral basis, driven by our strong contract value growth. Second quarter research contribution margin was 74% about in line with 2021. Higher than normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, increased scale, continued temporary avoidance of travel expenses and continuing to catch up on headcount to support the research business. Contract value or CV was $4.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 15% versus the prior year. As we discussed previously, CV reflects our decision to exit the Russian market, which contributed about $13 million in the second quarter 2021 number. This reduced the headline growth by about 40 basis points. Quarterly net contract value increased or NCVI was $97 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. The sequential increase in CV of $97 million was driven by the combination of continued strong retention rates and near record new business of close to $250 million. We saw a broad based CV growth across all of our practices. Our technology practice grew 14% and all of our business practices grew at double-digit growth rates with many of them growing more than 20% year-over-year. From an industry perspective, retail, media and manufacturing led our CV growth. Global technology sales contract value was $3.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 14% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $60 million, driven by strong retention and near record levels of new business for a second quarter. While retention for GTS was 107% for the quarter, up about 530 basis points year-over-year and near record levels. GTS new business was down 1% versus last year up, against the very tough compare. The two-year compound annual growth rate was about 16%. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 9% year-over-year. We are on track to get to double-digit growth by the end of 2022, as we have successfully brought turnover down and/or investments in recruiting are delivering results. We will continue to invest in our sales team to drive long-term sustained double-digit growth while also delivering strong margins. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global business sales contract value was $936 million at the end of the second quarter, up 23% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $37 million from the first quarter. While retention for GBS was 115% for the quarter, up about five percentage points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 3% compared to last year, reflecting robust growth across the full portfolio and against the very strong compare. The two-year compound annual growth rate for new business was 35%. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased 17% year-over-year, headcount we hire in 2022 will help to position us for sustained double-digit growth in the future. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $114 million, ahead of our expectations as attendees and exhibitors enthusiastically return to in-person. Contribution margin in the quarter was 65%. We held six in-person conferences and eight virtual conferences in the quarter. We held event meetings in both virtual and in-person formats. We planned to run 19 in-person conferences for the balance of the year. Second quarter consulting revenues increased by 14% year-over-year to $121 million, on an FX neutral basis revenues were up 20%. Consulting contribution margin was 42% in the second quarter up 120 basis points versus the prior year with better than expected revenue, higher utilization rates and a mixed benefit from strong growth in contract optimization. Labor-based revenues were $95 million up 11% versus Q2 of last year and up 18% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at June 30th was $152 million, increasing 45% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with another strong bookings quarter. The inclusion of multi-year contracts, a change we described last quarter contributed about 12 percentage points the year-over-year growth rate. Our contract optimization business was up 28% as reported and 31% on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly valuable. Consolidated cost of services increased 21% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 25% on an FX neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth and the return to in-person destination conferences SG&A increased 24% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 27% on an FX neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of increased hiring in sales and G&A functions, higher commission expense, following strong CV growth in 2021 and a $12 million one-time real estate charge. We expect SG&A expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue over the near term as our catch up hiring continues. EBITDA for the second quarter was $389 million up 10% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 14% FX neutral. Second quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our forecast and expenses at the low -end of our expectations. Depreciation in the quarter of $23 million was down modestly versus 2021. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $29 million up $2 million versus the second quarter of 2021 due to an increase in total debt balances. The Q2 adjusted tax rate which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income was 25.7% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $2.85, growth of 27% year-over-year. The average share count for the second quarter was 81 million shares. This is a reduction of about $5.6 million shares or about 6.5% year-over-year. We exited the second quarter with about 80 million shares outstanding on an unweighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $416 million. Adjusting for the insurance proceeds we received in the second quarter of 2021, operating cash flow was down 2% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $21 million up 76% year-over-year as a result of an increase in capitalized software, laptops and other infrastructure. Free cash flow for the quarter was $395 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. As many of you know, we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income, our conversion from EBITDA is very strong with the differences being cash interest, cash taxes and modest CapEx, partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows. Adjusting for the insurance proceeds we received last year, free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 21% on a rolling four quarter basis. On the same basis, free cash flow was 81% of EBITDA and 146% of GAAP net income. At the end of the second quarter, we had $360 million of cash. Our June 30th debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12 month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. We repurchased around 930 million of stock through the first half of this year. We had about 700 million remaining on our authorization at the end of June. We expect the board to continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. Since the end of 2020 through the end of this June, we have reduced our shares outstanding by 9 million shares. This is a reduction of 11%. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combining with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. Our medium-term outlook is for double digit revenue growth, while margins have been very strong the past two years we are continuing to catch up hiring and to resume travel spending. We estimate our underlying margins to be in the low twenties, well above pre-pandemic levels, and we expect them to increase modestly over time. We will give 2023 specific guidance in February consistent with our usual practice. Strong top line growth, modest margin expansion, low capital intensity, and working capital as a source of cash will allow us to deliver strong free cash flow now and in the future. We are increasing our full year guidance to reflect strong Q2 performance and an improved outlook for the second half despite incremental FX headwinds. We now expect an FX impact to our revenue growth rates of above 370 basis points for the full year. This is up from 260 basis points based on rates when we guided in May. As we discussed the last two quarters, 2021 research performance benefited from several factors, including QBH tenure mix, NCVI phasing within the quarters and the year, record retention rates and strong non-subscription growth. We continue to assume that those benefits do not persist at the same levels through 2022. The growth compares will continue to be challenging as we move through the year. We continue to take a measured approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we've reflected in the updated guidance. For conferences, we assume we will be able to run all the in-person conferences as planned. Consistent with our commentary the past couple of quarters, our assumptions for consolidated expenses continue to reflect significant headcount increases during the year to support current and future growth. We have modeled higher labor costs, T&E well above 2021 levels as we've previously indicated. We also have higher commission expense during 2022 due to the very good selling performance we delivered in 2021. Finally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. Our updated guidance for 2022 is as follows. We expect research revenue of at least $4.575 billion, which is FX neutral growth of about 15%. The FX neutral growth is up about 120 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong NCVI performance in the second quarter. We expect conferences revenue of at least $335 million, which is growth of about 63% FX neutral. We expect consulting revenue of at least $440 million, which is growth of about 11% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.35 billion, which is FX neutral growth of almost 17%. The FX neutral growth is up about 290 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong performance in the second quarter. Without the strengthening U.S. dollars since May, our revenue guidance would've been about $138 million than previous guidance. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.235 billion up $100 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since May, our EBITDA guidance would've been about $120 million higher than previous guidance. We now expect 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $8.85. For 2022 we now expect free cash flow of at least $985 million. Our guidance is based on 81 million shares outstanding, which reflects year-to-date repurchases. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our investor relations site. Finally, for the third quarter of 2022, we expect to deliver at least $255 million of EBITDA. Our strong performance in 2022 continued in the second quarter with momentum across the business. Contract value growth was very strong at 15%. Adjusted EPS grew 27% fueled by the significant reduction in shares over the past year. We repurchased around $930 million in stock this year through June and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales cost growing in line with CV growth and G&A leverage we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us up front. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck in M&A. With that I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Hey, good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the questions, in terms of the underlying margin. No, it wasn't locked in on 20.0% as low twenties. As we've looked at the business over the last few years we've learned a lot through the pandemic, et cetera. And so we're now comfortable that the underlying margins of the business are in the low twenties. And again, we can grow the top line double digit growth rates into the future and we can modestly expand margins from that point as well. In terms of \u2013 yeah, go ahead. Yeah. So that was the second part of the question. So again, the way we are thinking about running the business is again, we believe that there still is a huge untapped market opportunity. We believe one of the ways that we go capture that untapped market opportunity is by continuing to grow the sales force and again making sure we've got the right insights and the right number of analyst and advisors, et cetera. If there were to be recessionary impact on the business, we would toggle the investment growth rates in each of those areas to ensure that we could deliver those underlying margins and also ensure that we could drive modest margin expansion into the future as well. And Jeff, I would just echo having read briefly your report earlier this morning the compares are super tough in Q2 and they remain pretty tough throughout the balance of the year. We're still growing CV at a great growth rate. You heard some of the other metrics around their underlying businesses in conferences and consulting as well and so very tough compares for the balance of this year, but still feel good about the momentum of the business. And the other thing I'd add George is just, as we look at over the medium-term, we believe given the market opportunity and our ability to go capture that market, that both GTS and GBS can be consistent 12% to 16% growers. And so, yes, GBS is growing a little bit ahead of that right now, but we remain very, very, very confident that both GTS and GBS can continue to grow at very strong double digit growth rates. Yeah, it's a great question. So let me attempt to clarify because it is a very important question. So number one, I would say just as context, we can grow our top line at double digit growth rates and modestly expand margins over time. And there is operating leverage in the business at another way, right? So those are kind of two key points. When we were discussing the 20% normalized margin, we were really looking back to 2021 and attempting to give a view on if things had been \u201cmore normal\u201d what would our operating or EBITDA margins, what would they have been in 2021? What we're now providing is more of a go forward view around what do we believe the operating margins are that we can run the business at. And we have moved that higher over time to your point because we've gotten increased visibility into better ways to run our business. And so what is the new normal for travel expenses? What is the new normal for the amount of real estate we need? What does it look like when in-person conferences come back into the portfolio and what does it look like as we catch up on headcount and then continue to grow and invest to support and sustain future growth and so the way to think about that low-twenties number is yes, it's an update but it's also a view towards what do we think the underlying margins of the business are that we can modestly expand on. Yes, absolutely. So you've hit on a number of the items that will impact the margins in the second half of the year. So we're very aggressive on hiring the first half and we expect to remain as aggressive in the second half as we continue to catch up from hiring from 2021 and we also make sure that we're investing appropriately for the future so that's a big piece that goes into the cost base for the second half of year. The second big thing is resumption of travel. And some of that is tied to us returning to in-person destination conferences, but a lot of it is just normal, we run global teams and we want our leaders to be in front of those global teams and so we'll see that ramp up in the second half of the year as well. Third thing is our normal comp adjustment period happens April 1. So we only have one quarter of that in the first half of the year. We obviously have two quarters of that in the second half of the year. And so those are the three biggies as you think about bridging the expenses. And then the fourth one is with the return to in-person destination conferences. Obviously there's a lot of variable cost in delivering those in-person. Yes, I mean, I think Greg, the way to think about it is we want to make sure that we are matching our price increases with wage inflation or cost inflation. The bulk of our costs are people related. So we feel good that we are matching our price increases with what we're seeing on our wages. Yes, and Andrew, when we say broad based growth, it is broad based. So we look at it across our top 10 geographies, they're all growing at nice growth rates. When we look across industry cuts, they're all growing at nice growth rates. And so, yes, there are always pockets where there may be a little bit of a challenge for us, but generally those are either like super micro challenges or our own operational challenges. But the growth has remained pretty broad based. The biggest indicator where we've been growing and not growing is where a headcount, our sales headcount has grown faster or slower. Yes, Seth. Good morning. It's a good question. So I think the second half of the year will be more indicative of \u201cnormal travel\u201d, starting off the year, this year, given where we were with the pandemic, it was a little light in the first three or four months of the year and has started to pick back up. And so, yes, second half is probably more indicative. I think the way we're thinking about it is as compared to the last \u201cnormal year\u201d back in 2019 where we expect to spend probably at least 50% less than we did in 2019. And again, we just think that the company and our associate base has embraced and thrived, operating virtually. We still do need to travel, but we don't need to travel at the same volume that we did back in 2019. Yes, Seth, I think it just reflects that our clients had challenges that our clients had challenges that they need help with and then our content and the way we deliver the content was through consulting conferences or research is really helpful in helping them solve the problems. And so I think it's indicative, but we have a great value proposition, just kind of what's going on. Yes Seth. It is we had a really strong year on that line last year. So tough compares there, which again, we did model into our initial guidance and our updated guides as well, but to Gene's point, the products and offerings we have there offer a very strong and compelling value proposition in good times or rougher times. And so we still expect it to be a nice strong grower for us, but again, super tough compare against the 2021 performance. And Brendan, the way to think about that is that's sort of the normal algorithm for how we want to make sure that we are investing for both current needs and future sustained growth. Obviously, this year to Gene's point, we are doing a lot of catching up. And so you'll see those growth rates a little bit higher potentially obviously with GBS up at 17 and we're fully expecting both GTS and GBS to end the year with strong double-digit quota-bearing headcount growth. Yes. So I think, Brendan, obviously the second quarter, where our first in-person destination conferences in a few years and so we were pretty cautious about our expectations around the number of exhibitors and number of attendees that would want to come, would be able to come. And as you heard in our comments, I think both groups enthusiastically returned in the second quarter. And as Gene mentioned, earlier our bookings leading through our Q3 events and even the advanced bookings on Q4 conferences, look very strong as well. And so the update, the outlook is really just around some caution upfront because we hadn't delivered anything in person in essentially three \u2013 almost three years. And we saw an enthusiastic return from both revenue streams, attendees and our exhibitors. Hey Stephanie, good morning. From an M&A perspective, obviously, we've got a team that is actively out there looking at opportunities and staying in touch with a few hundred companies and actually tracking well more than that. I think our strategy as we've articulated is number one, we're an organic growth company and we believe we can achieve our medium term objectives of the double-digit growth and modest margin expansion organically. And so it does not require M&A to get there. That said, we do like to do M&A, when it can fill a gap or catalyze us or add an asset or capability or things like that. So I think as we look at the radar screen, we are looking at things that can catalyze us or fill in gaps or add assets to our portfolio that can help us over the long-term. I think there obviously over the last two or three quarters just like the equity markets has been a recalibration around valuations. I'm not sure every seller has completely recalibrated yet either. But again, we'll continue to be on the lookout for strong strategic value enhancing tuck-in opportunities that again can either catalyze growth, fill in a gap or add important assets for us."

            "content": "Good morning. Thanks for joining us. Gartner had a strong performance in the second quarter. We delivered double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS, and we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders through our buyback programs. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segments. Gartner Research provides actual objective insight to executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our expert guidance and tools enable faster, smarter decisions and stronger performance on our client's mission-critical priorities. We continue to have a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies and we're delivering more value than ever. The rate of change in the world is the fastest I've ever seen. Against this backdrop, Gartner continues to get even more agile. We're generating new insights to address timely impressing issues, such as leveraging and emerging technologies, optimizing costs, attracting and retaining talent in a hybrid world, managing cybersecurity risk and more. We deliver incredible value whether our clients are thriving, struggling, or somewhere in between. As a result, demand for our services remain strong. Q2 research revenue were 17% in the second quarter, total contract value growth was 15%, retention remained very strong. A new business was near all-time highs. We're also growing our sales teams. Global technology sales headcount was up 9% and global business sales headcount was up 17% year-over-year. Global Technology Sales or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS contract value grew 14%. Global business sales or GBS serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal, and more. GBS contract value grew 23%. Across every function, IT, supply chain, marketing, sales, HR, finance, and more, leaders and their teams benefit from our incredible value proposition. As a result, the enterprises we support see measurable progress on their mission-critical priorities. Leveraging the extraordinary value of our research insights, our conferences business brings the power of Gartner to life for an engaged and highly qualified audience. During Q2, we delivered our first in-person destination conferences since the start of the pandemic. These conferences covered IT, finance and supply chain in Europe, Australia, and the U.S. Attendee feedback has been resoundingly positive. They deeply value the opportunities to connect, engage, and learn in-person. Bookings continue at a strong pace for both exhibitors and attendees. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic technology initiatives through deeper extended project based work. Consulting had a strong quarter with revenue up 20%. Bookings were also strong, driving backlog up 45%. In closing, we saw strong growth across the business. We continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. We returned excess capital to shareholders, which reduced our shares outstanding. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for strong double-digit top line growth. Our underlying margins are in the low 20s, well above pre-pandemic levels, and we expect them to modestly increase over time. And we continue to generate free cash flow well in excess of earnings, which we will deploy to further drive shareholder value. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Craig? Hi Jeff, it's Gene. So the selling environment has been quite I think stable and good compared to Q1. Again, as you said we had near record new business levels. We have near record retention levels. Our conferences booking for both the exhibitors and attendees was very strong and that's been reflected in our guidance going forward, I believe the consulting business had one of the best quarters we've ever had with revenues of 20%, backlog up 45%. And there's kind of nothing, if we look under the covers that that would lead you to believe in Q2, there isn't anything other than selling and growth was quite robust. Hi, Heather, it's Gene. So we're very cognizant, always of the environment around us, and we try to make sure that we're as a business prepared for where the world is going and clearly being concerned about a macroeconomic downturn, one of those things. And first thing is, at any given point in time, we have clients that are growing clients that are shrinking and clients in between. So we always have clients that are struggling. What we see in a macroeconomic downturn is just more of those clients, but we do it all the time. Now, as I mentioned earlier, we've constantly adjust to try and make sure we are prepared for whatever economic environment comes. And we do this in a number of ways. One of them is we actually do surveys for our clients to understand kind of where their mindset is, what they're concerned about. In fact, in July, we did a survey of more than 150 Chief Financial Officers of our clients to see what was on their mind and therefore how she respond. And they have three priorities. One was securing talent, they're still seeing that it's hard to hire talent, and they're concerned about the wages for those talent. The second one is they want to keep accelerating digital, even in downturn. In fact, we asked these CFOs, what are they going to do in the downturn? 69% said, they're going to continue to increase spending on technology to downturn, 28% said they're going to maintain it and 3% said, they're going to decrease it. So this continued investment technology to prove the economics of business continues on. And the third priority was to manage spending on things like operations, real estate, travel, to pay to hire people and pay higher wages as well as to do these investments in digital. So what we're doing is we're taking our research content and line it with those kinds of priorities, help the clients, making sure they secure talent and manage with inflation, making sure they can continue to accelerate the digital impact on their business. And thirdly, most important maybe helping them to manage spend that's a big part of our business all the time. And we recently updated our, what we call cost optimization work to make sure we can help them with it. So we've updated our research based on, and I gave you the CFO survey. We do surveys all three level executives understand what their individual priorities are. We then update our research, make sure it's on those most construing topics. And then in fact, in July we introduced trainings all our sales people and our service people in terms of what are the most important issues today with clients like the things I just mentioned and how has our research changed so that we can match those fees. And then, we'll continue to do that going forward. And so this wasn't kind of a one-time thing we do once, we do this on an ongoing basis. So part of our strategy is to make sure our content is always on the topics people find important. Now, clearly one of those things is going to be how to manage costs and we will help them with that. But then making sure that all of our sales and service people are equipped to have conversations with senior executives on how we can help them with those priorities. And if this agility is the core part of our business, we also do structural things in our business. Like, if you \u2013 the share of both of your contracts we have is quite high and we first strategy to grow that over time. And so it is those two things making sure our content is great, our sales group preferred and making sure the underlying structural factors we can control are also there. That is, if you look over time, we perform better and better at each downturn. And we're certainly aware it might be a downturn and are preparing for it. So I'd say we haven't seen longer contracting cycles. I would say we see escalations it's more likely that a contract would be reviewed by a CFO than it was a year ago. Because we train our sales people, should that that's likely to happen and to be prepared for it. And to both prepare our meeting client who might be like the Chief HR Executive and Chief Information Officer that they might have to go to their CFO and review it and make sure they have what we call a CFO ready packet. Yeah. Hey George. I think it reflects the investments that we've made more than anything else. So you go back in fact, go back five years ago, we began investing pretty heavily in areas outside of IT. So I think marketing, supply chain, finance, HR, legal, sales those were areas that hadn't traditionally been strong for us. We were in a couple of them, we hadn't been strong. We after investments significantly both buying [indiscernible] and then after bought CEB with investments and what we're seeing in the accelerated growth rate in GBS now is the outcome of those investments. We kind of invested up front there's a lot of discussion about it at the time. And we increased sales capacity, increased research capacity, service capacity, developed a lot of content, and we're seeing the benefits of those. And so I think that's the first piece. The second piece is one of the major factors to grow our business. Clearly with this huge market opportunity is growing our sales head count. And while we increase sales productivity, we've had some good increase in productivity. Growing sales headcount is essential. And so the fact that we've grown our GBS head sales headcount faster over time, not with this quarter, but if you look at like over the last since 2019, we've grown our GBS sales headcount at compound growth rate of about 60% a year, I'm sorry about 5% a year. And that is which is faster than GTS, which is about flat. And so that's allowed the growth to be a lot higher in GBS. So those two things, the combination of the investments and the growth in Salesforce is what's really powered the faster CV growth. Yes, Andrew, great question. So the first in terms of our attrition, we want to retain our great associates. Attrition like many companies went up over the last couple years. We worked hard to understand the causes and then making sure that we address that. And actually our associate turnover has actually gone down now to kind of what we would call normal levels. And so we're very happy with that turnover. In addition to that, we have a very strong recruiting team. We have a truly world-class recruiting team and that recruiting team's been doing a great job and of course we have a great employee value proposition as well. So you combine those three things, lower turnover, a great employee value proposition, a crack recruiting team. That's allowed us to get our net associate headcount growth back up to where we need to support the growth in our business. Yes. Hey, there's \u2013 what I say is there's nothing systematic. If you look at Europe, Europe is proceeding along, there's some countries that are doing very well. There's some countries that aren't, and it's sort of typical of what we've seen. And then that is kind of flat and same is true for the rest of the world so nothing really remarkable in terms of U.S. versus different geographic region. Great question, Ryan, what I read in the press and what I see with a lot of other companies is a lot of challenges. I go to the CFO survey. One of the biggest concerns that CFOs have is their ability to hire talent. We've actually found that we've had no trouble hiring talent. Again, our employee value proposition is very strong. We have a great brand with associates and so we've had no trouble hiring people at all. And that's reflected in the hiring results that you saw. No, I don't think so. I mean, it's a relatively small line and it can be a little volatile. Again, I think as we look across, I would look broadly across the business for leading indicators, not one of the smallest revenue lines that we actually have out there. So now I would guide you to look at consulting, look at conferences and look at our research CV growth as leading indicators. Hey Brendan, it's a great question. I mean our business grew really rapidly last year and more rapidly we've expected and so we had a lot of hiring to catch up on, including in GTS. And so we want to get that catch up hiring so that we can properly service our clients and also be prepared to sell more clients. And over time we expect to grow our GTS sales force and GBS' by the way, take three to five percentage points slower than our CV growth. So CV growth is 15%, you'd expect to see over time our target would be headcount growth of 12% \u2013 10% to 12% growth. Hey, Brendan, so the first piece of it is that we're seeing very, very robust demand for conferences. Exhibitors are finding it in a great way to meet prospects for them. And the attendees find tremendous value, so we're finding just very strong demand for our conferences continuing on. And then I'll let Craig talk about how [indiscernible]. Hey Stephanie, great question. So tenure is an important determinant of productivity. When we hire new salesperson, it takes some time to fully get up to speed. And so a more tenure sales person is more productive. We're very focused on both hiring people to get up to speed quickly, as well as having internal training and other systems that help those new sales people get up to speed even faster. If you look at it, because we hired fewer people during the pandemic, the average tenure sales force last year was pretty high. The highest it's been in recent memory, as we ramped up our hiring, in Q2, it was more towards a normal tenure level as we keep hiring, we expect that to drop a bit for the rest of the year again during 2023. Well, summarizing today's call. In the second quarter, we drove strong performances across the business, across every geography, every industry, and every major function we deliver incredible value. We have strong demand for services with have a vast untapped market opportunity. We can drive sustained double-digit top line growth. As we invest for the future. We'll continue to return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders to our 2022 guidance. First of all, we increased our 2022 guidance. Thanks for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

Gartner had a great start to 2022. In the first quarter, performance was strong across the business. We delivered growth in revenue, EBITDA, EPS, and free cash flow. We drove acceleration in contract value and our significant share repurchase program has lowered our share count. 02:29 With our strong Q1 results, we\u2019re increasing our 2022 guidance. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Gartner research provides actionable objective insight to executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. 02:46 We continue to have a vast market opportunity across all structures, sizes, and geographies. And we are delivering more value to our clients than ever before. It was a high degree of volatility and uncertainty in the world. Our clients are facing more challenging decisions than ever before. We\u2019ve been incredible agile in supporting them through these trying times. 03:07 We\u2019re delivering more relevant and timely content on current pressing issues such as, successfully operating in a hybrid work environment, developing strategies to attract and retain talent, and managing supply chain disruptions. Beyond these issues, we continue to provide unparalleled insight and advise on top priorities, including transitioning to digital business, [within] [ph] diverse, equitable, and inclusive organizations, managing cyber security threats and much more. 03:36 Whether our clients are experiencing good times or bad, and regardless of role, we deliver incredible value to enterprise leaders and their teams and we have strong demand for our services. Research revenue grew 18% in Q1. Total contract value growth was 16% at the top end of our medium-term outlook. 03:56 Within our research segment, we serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global technology sales or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS contract value grew 14%. Global business sales or GPS serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal, and more. GTS contract value grew 24%. 04:27 Turning now to our conferences business, Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinary value to an engaged and highly qualified audience. Q1 is a seasonally small quarter for our conferences business, which performed as expected in the first quarter. We ran five virtual conferences in Q1. We pushed several conferences that traditionally occurred in Q1 to later in the year to facilitate bringing them in-person. 04:51 We continue to see strong demand for in-person conferences from our clients and prospects. We're taking a deliberate based approach as we return to in-person experiences. Next week, we will be hosting our first in-person conference since our pivot to virtual in 2020. The Gartner Data & Analytics Summit will run next week in London. Attendee tickets and exhibitor space has sold out for this summit. Our clients, prospects, analysts, and sales teams are eager to come together. 05:23 As we return to in-person conferences, we'll continue to leverage our profitable virtual conferences as a complement to our in-person conferences. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our [IC research business] [ph]. 05:45 Consulting revenue grew a very strong 20% in the first quarter. So, we had a great start to the year. To sustain our success over the long-term, we\u2019ve made target investments in hiring and retaining top talent that are paying off. Across the company, turnover has stabilized. We expanded our recruiting capacity last year and are adding new associates at a strong pace. 06:07 In Q1, we had our highest number of new hires ever. We grew headcount 4% sequentially achieving our quarterly hiring target. We\u2019re on pace to achieve our hiring goals for 2022. The world continues to face significant challenges. Beyond the unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a terrible humanitarian crisis. Our thoughts are with all those who continue to be impacted. 06:33 Gartner is exiting the Russian market. In addition, we\u2019ve established a free resource center to help leaders address a range of business issues that have emerged as a result of this crisis. 06:44 In closing, we started 2022 with strong performances. We\u2019ve great momentum across the business. Whether clients are experiencing good times or bad, and regardless of role, we deliver incredible value to enterprise leaders and their teams, and we have strong demand for our services. We\u2019ve a vast untapped market opportunity. 07:04 We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income. Looking ahead, we\u2019re well-positioned to drive strong top-line growth with modest margin expansion. As we invest for future growth, we\u2019ll continue to return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces our shares outstanding and increases returns in capital over time. With our strong Q1 results, we're increasing our 2022 guidance. 07:30 With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Who\u2019ll give you more detail. Craig?\nCraig Safian: 07:36 Thank you, Gene, and good morning. First quarter results were strong with acceleration in contract value growth and strength in revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. EPS was particularly strong as the benefit of share buybacks reduced our share count. With results above our expectations, we are increasing our 2022 guidance. The improved outlook reflects the better than expected first quarter top line results and increased revenue from conferences we now expect to hold in-person. 08:03 First quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year as reported and 16% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up 44 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $329 million, up 3% year-over-year and up 5% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.33, up 17% and free cash flow in the quarter was $150 million, up 4% year-over-year. 08:31 Adjusting for insurance proceeds received last year, free cash flow was up 17% on a rolling four quarter basis. Research revenue in the first quarter grew 16% year-over-year as reported and 18% on an FX neutral basis. Retention was very strong again and new business continued to increase. 08:49 First quarter research contribution margin was 75%, up 81 basis points versus 2021. Higher than normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, increased scale and continued temporary avoidance of travel expenses. We've been increasing our headcount, which we expect continue as we move through the year. 09:09 Contract Value or CV was $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 16% versus the prior year. This includes our decision to exit the Russian market, which reduced CV by about $14 million. Quarterly net Contract Value Increase or NCVI was $80 million net of the impact of Russia CV just noted. 09:32 Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure Contract Value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. We saw broad-based CV growth across all of our practices. Our technology practice grew 14% and all of our other business practices grew at double-digit growth rates with the majority of them growing more than 20% year-over-year. 09:54 From an industry perspective, retail, manufacturing, and services led our CV growth. Global Technology Sales Contract Value was $3.3 billion at end of the first quarter, up 14% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $46 million in the quarter. Again, net of the impact of exiting Russia, while retention for GTS was 107% for the quarter, up about 900 basis points year-over-year. 10:20 GTS new business was up 6% versus last year when very strong new business benefited from a post-pandemic [bounce] [ph], including modestly higher than normal win backs. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up slightly year-over-year. In the first quarter, we promoted a higher than normal level of frontline sellers to sales manager roles. This reflected our strong CV performance and sets us up for future growth. This March was our best hiring month since the start of the pandemic. 10:46 Our net hiring is in-line with our plan, turnover is improving, and we remain on track to achieve double-digit QBH growth this year. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. 10:59 Global Business Sales Contract Value was $899 million at the end of the first quarter, up 24% year-over-year, which is above the high-end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $34 million from the fourth quarter, while retention for GBS was 115% for the quarter, up about 11 percentage points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 18%, compared to last year, reflecting robust growth across the full portfolio and against a strong compare. 11:30 GBS quota-bearing headcount increased sequentially and is up 15% year-over-year. We remain on track to grow GBS headcount at double digit rates in 2022. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. 11:47 Conferences revenue for the first quarter was $10 million in-line with our expectations. The first quarter is always a seasonally small quarter and we pushed several conferences to later in the year to increase the likelihood of running them in-person. Contribution margin in the quarter was negative 28% given the seasonality in revenue and normal quarterly costs. We held five virtual conferences in the quarter. 12:09 We held Avanta meetings in both virtual and in-person formats. As we look to the rest of the year, we plan to run 24 in person conferences. We will continue to run a mix of in-person and virtual conferences as a part of our go-forward strategy for the business. I will detail our updated annual outlook for conferences shortly. 12:28 First quarter consulting revenues increased by 17% year-over-year to $116 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 20%. Consulting contribution margin was 44% in the first quarter, up almost 5 percentage points versus the prior year with better than expected revenue and a mixed benefit from strong growth in contract optimization. 12:49 Labor based revenues were $96 million, up 14% versus Q1 of last year and up 18% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at March 31 was $147 million, increasing 30% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with another strong bookings quarter. 13:06 We revised our backlog methodology to include the expected revenue from the out years of multi-year agreements. This change contributed about 7 percentage points to the backlog growth rate in the quarter. 13:17 Our contract optimization business was up 29% as reported and 30% on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year. As we've detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly [valuable] [ph]. 13:29 Consolidated cost of services increased 13% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 14% on an FX neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth. SG&A increased 27% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 29% on an FX neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of a $24 million non-recurring real estate charge, higher commission expense, following strong CV growth in 2021, and increased hiring in sales and G&A functions. 14:01 SG&A without the facilities related charge would have increased 22% year-over-year and would have been 47% of revenue in the quarter. We expect SG&A expenses to increase over time as our hiring continues. EBITDA for the first quarter was $329 million, up 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 5% FX neutral. 14:22 First quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected revenue exceeding our forecasts. Depreciation in the quarter of $23 million was down modestly versus 2021. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $30 million, up $5 million versus the first quarter of 2021, due to an increase in total debt balances. The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income was 20.3% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 24% for the quarter. 14:55 Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2.33, growth of 17% year-over-year. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the first quarter was 83 million. This is a reduction of more than 6 million shares or about 7% year-over-year. We exited the first quarter with about 82 million fully diluted shares. 15:15 Operating cash flow for the quarter was $168 million, up 7% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $17 million, up 38% year-over-year as a result of an increase in capitalized software. Free cash flow for the quarter was $150 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. 15:39 As many of you know, we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income. Our conversion from EBITDA is very strong with the differences being cash interest, cash taxes, and modest CapEx, partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows. Adjusting for the insurance proceeds we received last year, free cash flow is a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 22% on a rolling four quarter basis. 16:04 On the same basis, free cash flow was 84% of EBITDA and 159% of GAAP net income. At the end of the first quarter, we had $456 million of cash. Our March 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. 16:23 Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver, and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. We repurchased around $450 million of stock during the first quarter and about $630 million through the end of April. 16:43 Last week, the Board increased the repurchase authorization by $500 million bringing us to a total of about $1 billion available for open market buybacks. We expect the Board to continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. Since the end of 2020 through the end of this April, we\u2019ve reduced our shares outstanding by 8 million shares. This is a reduction of 9% from the end of 2020. 17:07 As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are increasing our full-year guidance to reflect strong Q1 performance and the return of in-person conferences. 17:24 We also updated guidance to reflect a stronger U.S. dollar. We now expect an FX impact to our revenue growth rates of about 260 basis points for the full-year. This is up from 150 basis points based on rates when we guided in February. As we detailed last quarter, 2021 research performance benefited from several factors, including QBH tenure mix, NCVI phasing within the quarters and the year, record retention rates and strong non-subscription growth. We continue to assume that those benefits do not persist at the same levels through 2022. 17:58 The growth compares also get harder as we move through the year. We were taking a balanced approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we've reflected in the updated guidance. We are updating our guidance for the incremental revenue from 24 planned in-person conferences with significantly more visibility into the second quarter. We will continue to update our outlook as we have more visibility. 18:20 For our local one day Avanta events, we expect to run most of them in-person while continuing to run some virtually. We expect about one-third of our full-year conferences revenue in the second quarter this year. 18:32 Consistent with our commentary last quarter, our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses continue to reflect significant headcount increases during the year to support current and future growth. 18:43 We have modeled higher labor costs and [T&E] [ph] well above 2021 levels as we\u2019ve previously indicated. We will also have higher commissions during 2022 due to the very good selling performance we delivered in 2021. Finally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. 19:04 Our updated guidance for 2022 is as follows: We expect research revenue of at least $4.575 billion, which is FX neutral growth of about 14%. The FX neutral growth is up about 160 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong NCVI performance in the first quarter. We expect conferences revenue of at least $270 million, which is growth of about 30% FX neutral. 19:30 We expect consulting revenue of at least $430 million, which is growth of about 7% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.275 billion, which is FX neutral growth of 14%. The FX neutral growth is up about 330 basis points from our prior guidance, due to strong performance in the first quarter and the shift in person conferences. 19:52 Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since February, our revenue guidance would have been about $155 million higher than previous guidance. We now expect full-year EBITDA of at least $1.135 billion, up $100 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since February, our EBITDA guidance would have been about $110 million higher in previous guidance. 20:18 We now expect 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $7.80. For 2022, we now expect free cash flow at least $930 million. Our guidance is based on $82 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of April. All of the details of our full-year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. 20:40 Finally, for the second quarter of 2022, we expect to deliver at least $300 million of EBITDA. We\u2019ve a strong start to the year with momentum across the business. Contract Value continue to accelerate. EPS grew mid-teens fueled by the significant reduction of shares over the past year. We repurchased roughly $630 million in stock this year through April and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. 20:40 Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in-line with CV growth over time, and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from the normalized 2021 level. 21:26 We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront, and we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing, tuck-in M&A. 21:42 With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: 21:42 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: 22:03 Yes. Thank you, and great quarter. So, you already gave me 15 talking points on this, but I'm going to ask about it anyway. Just a quota-bearing sales headcount being flat, so, just so I understand reconciling what you gave us to that metric, so the turnover is seasonally higher in Q1, but turnover for quota-bearing headcount is actually getting better year-over-year and then Q1 is also seasonally high for promotions and given the planned growth, there's more promotions this year than there were last year, but hiring is performing to plan and is actually the best since before the pandemic, are those the right reconciliation points to explain while QBH is still flat sequentially?\nGene Hall: 22:56 Yeah, It\u2019s Gene. So, [Technical Difficulty] is going to plan and we're on track for the year [Technical Difficulty] double-digit headcount in our [Technical Difficulty] headcount. As you have more [portions] [ph] at the January [Technical Difficulty] year we've done this for long period of [Technical Difficulty]. 23:25 So, we will be [Technical Difficulty] January to your point, we [Technical Difficulty] backlog [Technical Difficulty] because of the pandemic than we've had in the [Technical Difficulty] pandemic were. So, that's [Technical Difficulty] bigger drain on quota-bearing headcount.\nJeff Meuler: 23:52 Okay. I don't know if you can hear me\u2026\nCraig Safian: 23:56 Yes, Jeff, let me just repeat what Gene said, we're just having a little bit of trouble in his microphone. So, a couple points\u2026\nJeff Meuler: 24:14 I don't know if it's just me. I'm also having trouble hearing you.\nCraig Safian: 24:21 All right. So hopefully now you can hear me?\nJeff Meuler: 24:24 Yes.\nCraig Safian : 24:26 Okay, great. So, we'll work through the problem with Gene\u2019s mic, but he was saying, as we've seen improving attrition really starting in the second half of last year and continuing through this year, which is very, very positive. We do almost all of our promotions in the beginning of the year in January, and so because of the really strong growth and bounce back in GTS, we had more promotions than we normally have in the first quarter, and obviously, we fill them generally with our best performing frontline associates. It\u2019s the next step in the promotional ladder that our frontline sellers take. 25:14 As Gene and I both mentioned in our prepared remarks, very strong recruitment and hiring across the organization and in particular in GTS. And then the one other thing I would add, it had a modest impact, but was also the exiting of Russia had a small impact on the sequential QBH reported number as well.\nJeff Meuler: 25:37 Got it. Very helpful. And then on conferences, so I can under understand kind of the business performance and the assumptions, for the Q2 conferences that you have better line of sight to, I heard that at least some of them look like record attendance or sold out attendance. Are those conferences, are you monetizing them above the pre-pandemic level at this point and the full-year guidance being below the pre-pandemic level is about the risk-adjusting the conferences assumptions for later in the year, plus fewer conferences, just wondering conference monetization of those that are happening with good line of sight relative to pre-pandemic?\nCraig Safian: 26:23 Yes, Jeff, it's a great question and Gene will follow on here as well. So, a few thoughts there. So, as we noted, we are transitioning 24 that had previously been planned as virtual to run in-person over the balance of the year. And clearly, we have more visibility into ones that are running next week, as Gene noted than ones that are running in the fourth quarter. 26:50 From a monetization perspective, just a couple of thoughts there. So, one is, we're planning on having fewer \u2013 in some cases, fewer attendees in each of the conferences than we had historically to be mindful of being able to social distance and not feel like we are packing everyone in shoulder-to-shoulder given the environment. 27:15 And so in some cases, we will have fewer attendees than we had in pre-pandemic. In some cases as the conferences have been building, we'll have more attendees than we had pre-pandemic. And so, the revenues will not bounce back immediately to pre-pandemic levels predominantly because we want to make sure that we can keep people say healthy and feeling safe and healthy at the conferences by just moderating the attendance.\nJeff Meuler: 27:47 Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: 27:51 Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: 27:56 Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about pricing, are you able to increase prices more this year compared to prior years just given the inflationary environment and have customers been generally understanding about it, if that\u2019s the case?\nCraig Safian: 28:25 Hi Toni. Thanks for the question. So, we are being a little more aggressive on pricing this year, and the way we're basically thinking about it is, you know as we're dealing with and have modeled in more wage inflation or cost inflation on our people, we are making sure that we at least match that from a pricing perspective so that we can protect our margins. And I say, generally speaking, so far this year our clients are understanding of the price increases. Again, as we've talked about in the past, our \u2013 the spending with us at most of our clients represents a pretty small ticket item and modest price increase our clients are generally understanding, and of course, we've been significantly improving our products and insights along the way as well.\nToni Kaplan: 29:24 Great. I wanted to also ask about the EBITDA margin guidance you raised the margin to 21.5% for the year from 20%. And I think the results in the quarter and the FX impact based on my estimates that drove sort of about [half the raise] [ph], but maybe you could have had different forecast than I did, but anything outside of the first quarter be in the FX that really drove, sort of the higher margin for the year, that\u2019d be helpful? Thanks.\nCraig Safian: 29:58 Yeah, of course. That's great question. The way to think about it is probably two or three things. So, number one, the NCVI performance in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, and obviously that benefited Q1, but it also flows through into the balance of the year and generally flows through pretty nicely from an incremental margin perspective. 30:25 Second thing is obviously the pivot to in-person conferences and that incremental $70 million of revenue does flow through with some decent incremental margins there. And then third, there are some SG&A savings, predominantly G&A savings that we\u2019re able to dial through P&L as well and most notably, we did take as you would know a charge for real estate in the quarter and we dialed in the 2022 expense benefit from that facility chart. So, it's really a combination of those three things that are driving both the revenue and EBITDA side and translating into modestly higher EBITDA margins for the full-year.\nToni Kaplan: 31:12 Terrific. Thanks again. Congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: 31:16 Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: 31:21 Hi, thanks. Good morning. GTS and GBS productivity both increased pretty significantly in the quarter, can you elaborate on the factors driving improvement and productivity and how much further improvement you see in both of the segments?\nGene Hall: 31:37 Hey it's Gene, I'll try again. Hopefully my line works this time. So, basically, we're very focused on improving productivity for both GTS and GBS. It's been [indiscernible] one period of time, and we have a lot of programs we talked about from time-to-time on improvement productivity. It includes things like our recruiting programs, our training programs, the tools we give our salespeople people and our processes. And what you're seeing I think, it also includes become our content to making sure on the most important issues. And I think all those things are coming together driving productivity. 32:11 In addition to that, because of our slower growth in headcount last year, we have an higher average tenure than we would have, it kind of normal time to call it pre-pandemic times. 32:22 So, those are the key factors that drive productivity. The operational changes we're making and modestly higher tenure, compared with pre-pandemic times?\nGeorge Tong: 32:31 Got it. That's helpful. And then you're guiding to double digit growth in headcount this year, can you elaborate on how much headcount growth you're expecting in GTS, compared to GBS over the remainder of this year?\nGene Hall: 32:46 Yes. Yes, we're expecting both to grow double-digit rates because of the faster contracts I\u2019ve roughly seen from GBS. We\u2019d expect that double-digit headcount to be modestly higher than GTS.\nGeorge Tong: 32:58 Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: 33:03 Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nTrevor Romeo: 33:08 Hi, good morning. This is actually Trevor Romeo in for Andrew. Thanks so much for taking the questions. First, I was kind of just wondering if you could call out any drivers of the consulting strength with 20% FX neutral growth and what look like record backlog, any new kind of service offerings or changes that clients have been particularly receptive to there?\nCraig Safian: 33:30 Hey, Trevor, we always make improvements to our processes and we've been making substantial improvements to our consulting processes, but is fundamentally the strategy we have, which is consulting is an extension of our research business and we're helping clients with the same difficult issues that we do in our research business, but it led to us work with clients in a more in-depth way for those clients that prefer that. And so it's really a combination of operational changes with fundamental demand.\nTrevor Romeo: 33:55 Okay, great.\nGene Hall: 33:57 Sorry, Trevor. I would just add. The growth in the quarter was both across labor base and contract optimization. So, 14% year-over-year reported growth are our labor based revenue and 29% reported growth on the contract optimization business.\nTrevor Romeo: 34:17 Yes. Understood. Thank you. And then just kind of a follow-up on the margin outlook, looks like now 2022, the guide implies about 21%, 22% margins, has you're thinking around kind of the normalized margin run rate for the business going forward kind of also increased? Is this kind of a good baseline to build on?\nGene Hall: 34:39 Hey, Trevor. Great question. So, the implied margin of the outlook right now is about 21.5%. The way we continue to think about it is, our normalized margin is around 20 as we think about it. We are still seeing some benefits and we are still catching up to some extent on a number of items whether it be headcount, travel, and a few other things. And so the way to think about the normalized margins moving forward is around 20%.\nTrevor Romeo: 35:17 Okay great. Thank very much very. Very helpful.\nOperator: 35:21 Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: 35:28 Hi. Good morning. This is [Ryan] [ph] on for Jeff. Just had a follow-up question on the conferences. Given the move to in-person conferences this year, how does that affect the financial model from both a margin percentage in margin dollar basis?\nGene Hall: 35:43 Hey, good morning. So, yes, as you saw we\u2019re \u2013 we flow through an incremental $70 million of revenues. And guys important to remember that we're pivoting from virtual where there was revenue expectations in-person where there was just a higher revenue expectation. So, it's not going from zero to something, it's going from a smaller number based on a virtual conference to a larger number based on an in-person conference. 36:13 As I mentioned earlier, I forgot who\u2019s question it was \u2013 it was about, it was Jeff's question about the scale of the conferences. We are running them at a little bit lower scale than we had pre-pandemic, and so our expectation on the margin flow through is not as high as it would have been pre-pandemic. That said, the margin dollar flow through is obviously more than it would be had we been running virtual. 36:46 So, the way to think about it is, we're probably in the 20% to 30% incremental margin flow through on the shift from virtual to in-person conferences is that hurts the margin percentage, but it\u2019s obviously [helpful] [ph] in terms of generating nicely more margin dollars for us going through to the bottom line.\nUnidentified Analyst: 37:16 Got it. Thank you. And then just a modeling question. When should we think about normalized T&E expense base returning this year?\nGene Hall: 37:28 Yes. It's slowly building. Q1 given the environment and given the fact that we weren't running too many conferences or any in-person conferences was very late. We would expect second half of the year to look more like \u201cnormal\u201d. That said, though, we are still rebuilding our conferences portfolios as we roll into years beyond 2022, there may be more travel associated with delivering those. But second half of the year, we expect to be back at a semi-normal rate of travel. But again, I think we won't get back to true normal travel levels until our conference portfolio has fully come back.\nOperator: 38:30 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nHeather Balsky: 38:40 Hi, thank you. First, just a follow-up question on the normalized margin outlook you talked about, you still think it's 20%, I guess, given that you exceeded plan thus far this year and you raised your guidance, I'm curious then when you think about the 150 basis points of margin improvement in your guide, how much of that, kind of is a go forward, sustainable benefit or [indiscernible]? And how much of it, I guess how much shifted into next year? I'm just curious given that you be planned why \u2013 why a margin outlook would stay at 20%?\nCraig Safian : 39:19 Hey, good morning, Heather. I think it's a few things. So, one, given the really strong growth that we delivered last year, we are still to an extent catching up on all the people we need on staff to really deliver to our clients and drive future growth. And so, while we're hiring at a furious cases, as Gene highlighted and we are on our operational plan, we are still playing catch up in some areas. And so that would be a little bit of, some of the bridge between the 21.5 and the normalized level of 20. 40:09 We just talked about one of the other levers, which is travel, which again has not fully come back yet. We actually were under a plan in travel expense in the first quarter. We do expect it to build, but as I just discussed, it's not back to full \u201cnormalized levels\u201d yet and we'll get there over time. 40:32 Those are probably the two biggest ones and then obviously also making sure that we are making all the right investments so that we can drive repeatable, sustained top-line, double-digit growth. Again, that means growing GTS and GBS at those double-digit growth rates and continuing to do that. And I think those are the three big factors as we think about the current guide, and then the normalized level of margins.\nHeather Balsky: 41:03 Got it. And your second comment, I guess brings me to my follow-up question, which is, as we think of the rest of the year, if you were to exceed on your sales plan, I think you talked in the past about what your [flow through on] [ph] the gross margin side is? I'm curious how much, how should we think about incremental investment for kind of any [sales beats] [ph] that you \u2013 they might see as the year progresses?\nCraig Safian : 41:31 Yes. I mean, I think we are \u2013 we built a real solid operational plan at beginning of the year that had the sales hiring and expert hiring and service hiring that we need to deliver on 2022 and also to make sure that we're set up to continue to drive really strong growth rates into 2023 and beyond. 42:02 If CV growth is a little faster than we had expected, there would probably be incremental sellers, incremental experts, and incremental service people. Again, to make sure that we keep our clients really, really happy and keep delivering great value and can continue to grow. So, as we move through the year, I'd say right now, we feel good about our investment plans and hiring plans. 42:28 If the performance is starting to look higher or lower than our current expectations, we will obviously adjust as necessary. So, if we see stronger growth, we would probably do more hiring; if we see softer growth, we would potentially slow down a little bit, but from where we sit today, we feel like we've got a really strong hiring plan that will allow us to deliver on 2022 and also set us up for continuing to grow into the future.\nHeather Balsky: 42:58 Great. Thank you for your help.\nOperator: 43:01 Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn to call back over to Gene Hall for closing remarks.\nGene Hall: 43:08 So summarizing today's call, we started 2022 with strong performances. We have great momentum across the business. With our clients who are experiencing good times or bad, and regardless of role, we can deliver incredible value to enterprise leaders and their teams. 43:23 We have strong demand for our services. We have a vast untapped market opportunity. We generate significant free cash flow and excess net income. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to drive strong top line growth with modest margin expansion. 43:38 As we invest for future growth, we\u2019ll continue to return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces our shares outstanding and increases returns on capital over time, and with our strong results we\u2019re increasing our 2022 guidance. 43:52 Thanks for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: 43:57 This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "07:36 Thank you, Gene, and good morning. First quarter results were strong with acceleration in contract value growth and strength in revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. EPS was particularly strong as the benefit of share buybacks reduced our share count. With results above our expectations, we are increasing our 2022 guidance. The improved outlook reflects the better than expected first quarter top line results and increased revenue from conferences we now expect to hold in-person. 08:03 First quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% year-over-year as reported and 16% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up 44 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $329 million, up 3% year-over-year and up 5% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.33, up 17% and free cash flow in the quarter was $150 million, up 4% year-over-year. 08:31 Adjusting for insurance proceeds received last year, free cash flow was up 17% on a rolling four quarter basis. Research revenue in the first quarter grew 16% year-over-year as reported and 18% on an FX neutral basis. Retention was very strong again and new business continued to increase. 08:49 First quarter research contribution margin was 75%, up 81 basis points versus 2021. Higher than normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, increased scale and continued temporary avoidance of travel expenses. We've been increasing our headcount, which we expect continue as we move through the year. 09:09 Contract Value or CV was $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 16% versus the prior year. This includes our decision to exit the Russian market, which reduced CV by about $14 million. Quarterly net Contract Value Increase or NCVI was $80 million net of the impact of Russia CV just noted. 09:32 Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure Contract Value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. We saw broad-based CV growth across all of our practices. Our technology practice grew 14% and all of our other business practices grew at double-digit growth rates with the majority of them growing more than 20% year-over-year. 09:54 From an industry perspective, retail, manufacturing, and services led our CV growth. Global Technology Sales Contract Value was $3.3 billion at end of the first quarter, up 14% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $46 million in the quarter. Again, net of the impact of exiting Russia, while retention for GTS was 107% for the quarter, up about 900 basis points year-over-year. 10:20 GTS new business was up 6% versus last year when very strong new business benefited from a post-pandemic [bounce] [ph], including modestly higher than normal win backs. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up slightly year-over-year. In the first quarter, we promoted a higher than normal level of frontline sellers to sales manager roles. This reflected our strong CV performance and sets us up for future growth. This March was our best hiring month since the start of the pandemic. 10:46 Our net hiring is in-line with our plan, turnover is improving, and we remain on track to achieve double-digit QBH growth this year. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. 10:59 Global Business Sales Contract Value was $899 million at the end of the first quarter, up 24% year-over-year, which is above the high-end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $34 million from the fourth quarter, while retention for GBS was 115% for the quarter, up about 11 percentage points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 18%, compared to last year, reflecting robust growth across the full portfolio and against a strong compare. 11:30 GBS quota-bearing headcount increased sequentially and is up 15% year-over-year. We remain on track to grow GBS headcount at double digit rates in 2022. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. 11:47 Conferences revenue for the first quarter was $10 million in-line with our expectations. The first quarter is always a seasonally small quarter and we pushed several conferences to later in the year to increase the likelihood of running them in-person. Contribution margin in the quarter was negative 28% given the seasonality in revenue and normal quarterly costs. We held five virtual conferences in the quarter. 12:09 We held Avanta meetings in both virtual and in-person formats. As we look to the rest of the year, we plan to run 24 in person conferences. We will continue to run a mix of in-person and virtual conferences as a part of our go-forward strategy for the business. I will detail our updated annual outlook for conferences shortly. 12:28 First quarter consulting revenues increased by 17% year-over-year to $116 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 20%. Consulting contribution margin was 44% in the first quarter, up almost 5 percentage points versus the prior year with better than expected revenue and a mixed benefit from strong growth in contract optimization. 12:49 Labor based revenues were $96 million, up 14% versus Q1 of last year and up 18% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at March 31 was $147 million, increasing 30% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with another strong bookings quarter. 13:06 We revised our backlog methodology to include the expected revenue from the out years of multi-year agreements. This change contributed about 7 percentage points to the backlog growth rate in the quarter. 13:17 Our contract optimization business was up 29% as reported and 30% on an FX neutral basis versus the prior year. As we've detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly [valuable] [ph]. 13:29 Consolidated cost of services increased 13% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 14% on an FX neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth. SG&A increased 27% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 29% on an FX neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of a $24 million non-recurring real estate charge, higher commission expense, following strong CV growth in 2021, and increased hiring in sales and G&A functions. 14:01 SG&A without the facilities related charge would have increased 22% year-over-year and would have been 47% of revenue in the quarter. We expect SG&A expenses to increase over time as our hiring continues. EBITDA for the first quarter was $329 million, up 3% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 5% FX neutral. 14:22 First quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected revenue exceeding our forecasts. Depreciation in the quarter of $23 million was down modestly versus 2021. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $30 million, up $5 million versus the first quarter of 2021, due to an increase in total debt balances. The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income was 20.3% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 24% for the quarter. 14:55 Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2.33, growth of 17% year-over-year. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the first quarter was 83 million. This is a reduction of more than 6 million shares or about 7% year-over-year. We exited the first quarter with about 82 million fully diluted shares. 15:15 Operating cash flow for the quarter was $168 million, up 7% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $17 million, up 38% year-over-year as a result of an increase in capitalized software. Free cash flow for the quarter was $150 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest CapEx needs and upfront client payments. 15:39 As many of you know, we generate free cash flow well in excess of net income. Our conversion from EBITDA is very strong with the differences being cash interest, cash taxes, and modest CapEx, partially offset by strong working capital cash inflows. Adjusting for the insurance proceeds we received last year, free cash flow is a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 22% on a rolling four quarter basis. 16:04 On the same basis, free cash flow was 84% of EBITDA and 159% of GAAP net income. At the end of the first quarter, we had $456 million of cash. Our March 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. 16:23 Our expected free cash flow generation, unused revolver, and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. We repurchased around $450 million of stock during the first quarter and about $630 million through the end of April. 16:43 Last week, the Board increased the repurchase authorization by $500 million bringing us to a total of about $1 billion available for open market buybacks. We expect the Board to continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. Since the end of 2020 through the end of this April, we've reduced our shares outstanding by 8 million shares. This is a reduction of 9% from the end of 2020. 17:07 As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are increasing our full-year guidance to reflect strong Q1 performance and the return of in-person conferences. 17:24 We also updated guidance to reflect a stronger U.S. dollar. We now expect an FX impact to our revenue growth rates of about 260 basis points for the full-year. This is up from 150 basis points based on rates when we guided in February. As we detailed last quarter, 2021 research performance benefited from several factors, including QBH tenure mix, NCVI phasing within the quarters and the year, record retention rates and strong non-subscription growth. We continue to assume that those benefits do not persist at the same levels through 2022. 17:58 The growth compares also get harder as we move through the year. We were taking a balanced approach based on historical trends and patterns, which we've reflected in the updated guidance. We are updating our guidance for the incremental revenue from 24 planned in-person conferences with significantly more visibility into the second quarter. We will continue to update our outlook as we have more visibility. 18:20 For our local one day Avanta events, we expect to run most of them in-person while continuing to run some virtually. We expect about one-third of our full-year conferences revenue in the second quarter this year. 18:32 Consistent with our commentary last quarter, our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses continue to reflect significant headcount increases during the year to support current and future growth. 18:43 We have modeled higher labor costs and [T&E] [ph] well above 2021 levels as we've previously indicated. We will also have higher commissions during 2022 due to the very good selling performance we delivered in 2021. Finally, we continue to invest in our tech, both client facing and internal applications as part of our innovation and continuous improvement programs. 19:04 Our updated guidance for 2022 is as follows: We expect research revenue of at least $4.575 billion, which is FX neutral growth of about 14%. The FX neutral growth is up about 160 basis points from our prior guidance due to strong NCVI performance in the first quarter. We expect conferences revenue of at least $270 million, which is growth of about 30% FX neutral. 19:30 We expect consulting revenue of at least $430 million, which is growth of about 7% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.275 billion, which is FX neutral growth of 14%. The FX neutral growth is up about 330 basis points from our prior guidance, due to strong performance in the first quarter and the shift in person conferences. 19:52 Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since February, our revenue guidance would have been about $155 million higher than previous guidance. We now expect full-year EBITDA of at least $1.135 billion, up $100 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. Without the strengthening U.S. dollar since February, our EBITDA guidance would have been about $110 million higher in previous guidance. 20:18 We now expect 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $7.80. For 2022, we now expect free cash flow at least $930 million. Our guidance is based on $82 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of April. All of the details of our full-year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. 20:40 Finally, for the second quarter of 2022, we expect to deliver at least $300 million of EBITDA. We've a strong start to the year with momentum across the business. Contract Value continue to accelerate. EPS grew mid-teens fueled by the significant reduction of shares over the past year. We repurchased roughly $630 million in stock this year through April and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. 20:40 Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in-line with CV growth over time, and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from the normalized 2021 level. 21:26 We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront, and we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing, tuck-in M&A. 21:42 With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? 23:56 Yes, Jeff, let me just repeat what Gene said, we're just having a little bit of trouble in his microphone. So, a couple points... 24:21 All right. So hopefully now you can hear me? 24:26 Okay, great. So, we'll work through the problem with Gene's mic, but he was saying, as we've seen improving attrition really starting in the second half of last year and continuing through this year, which is very, very positive. We do almost all of our promotions in the beginning of the year in January, and so because of the really strong growth and bounce back in GTS, we had more promotions than we normally have in the first quarter, and obviously, we fill them generally with our best performing frontline associates. It's the next step in the promotional ladder that our frontline sellers take. 25:14 As Gene and I both mentioned in our prepared remarks, very strong recruitment and hiring across the organization and in particular in GTS. And then the one other thing I would add, it had a modest impact, but was also the exiting of Russia had a small impact on the sequential QBH reported number as well. 26:23 Yes, Jeff, it's a great question and Gene will follow on here as well. So, a few thoughts there. So, as we noted, we are transitioning 24 that had previously been planned as virtual to run in-person over the balance of the year. And clearly, we have more visibility into ones that are running next week, as Gene noted than ones that are running in the fourth quarter. 26:50 From a monetization perspective, just a couple of thoughts there. So, one is, we're planning on having fewer \u2013 in some cases, fewer attendees in each of the conferences than we had historically to be mindful of being able to social distance and not feel like we are packing everyone in shoulder-to-shoulder given the environment. 27:15 And so in some cases, we will have fewer attendees than we had in pre-pandemic. In some cases as the conferences have been building, we'll have more attendees than we had pre-pandemic. And so, the revenues will not bounce back immediately to pre-pandemic levels predominantly because we want to make sure that we can keep people say healthy and feeling safe and healthy at the conferences by just moderating the attendance. 28:25 Hi Toni. Thanks for the question. So, we are being a little more aggressive on pricing this year, and the way we're basically thinking about it is, you know as we're dealing with and have modeled in more wage inflation or cost inflation on our people, we are making sure that we at least match that from a pricing perspective so that we can protect our margins. And I say, generally speaking, so far this year our clients are understanding of the price increases. Again, as we've talked about in the past, our \u2013 the spending with us at most of our clients represents a pretty small ticket item and modest price increase our clients are generally understanding, and of course, we've been significantly improving our products and insights along the way as well. 29:58 Yeah, of course. That's great question. The way to think about it is probably two or three things. So, number one, the NCVI performance in the first quarter exceeded our expectations, and obviously that benefited Q1, but it also flows through into the balance of the year and generally flows through pretty nicely from an incremental margin perspective. 30:25 Second thing is obviously the pivot to in-person conferences and that incremental $70 million of revenue does flow through with some decent incremental margins there. And then third, there are some SG&A savings, predominantly G&A savings that we're able to dial through P&L as well and most notably, we did take as you would know a charge for real estate in the quarter and we dialed in the 2022 expense benefit from that facility chart. So, it's really a combination of those three things that are driving both the revenue and EBITDA side and translating into modestly higher EBITDA margins for the full-year. 33:30 Hey, Trevor, we always make improvements to our processes and we've been making substantial improvements to our consulting processes, but is fundamentally the strategy we have, which is consulting is an extension of our research business and we're helping clients with the same difficult issues that we do in our research business, but it led to us work with clients in a more in-depth way for those clients that prefer that. And so it's really a combination of operational changes with fundamental demand. 39:19 Hey, good morning, Heather. I think it's a few things. So, one, given the really strong growth that we delivered last year, we are still to an extent catching up on all the people we need on staff to really deliver to our clients and drive future growth. And so, while we're hiring at a furious cases, as Gene highlighted and we are on our operational plan, we are still playing catch up in some areas. And so that would be a little bit of, some of the bridge between the 21.5 and the normalized level of 20. 40:09 We just talked about one of the other levers, which is travel, which again has not fully come back yet. We actually were under a plan in travel expense in the first quarter. We do expect it to build, but as I just discussed, it's not back to full \u201cnormalized levels\u201d yet and we'll get there over time. 40:32 Those are probably the two biggest ones and then obviously also making sure that we are making all the right investments so that we can drive repeatable, sustained top-line, double-digit growth. Again, that means growing GTS and GBS at those double-digit growth rates and continuing to do that. And I think those are the three big factors as we think about the current guide, and then the normalized level of margins. 41:31 Yes. I mean, I think we are \u2013 we built a real solid operational plan at beginning of the year that had the sales hiring and expert hiring and service hiring that we need to deliver on 2022 and also to make sure that we're set up to continue to drive really strong growth rates into 2023 and beyond. 42:02 If CV growth is a little faster than we had expected, there would probably be incremental sellers, incremental experts, and incremental service people. Again, to make sure that we keep our clients really, really happy and keep delivering great value and can continue to grow. So, as we move through the year, I'd say right now, we feel good about our investment plans and hiring plans. 42:28 If the performance is starting to look higher or lower than our current expectations, we will obviously adjust as necessary. So, if we see stronger growth, we would probably do more hiring; if we see softer growth, we would potentially slow down a little bit, but from where we sit today, we feel like we've got a really strong hiring plan that will allow us to deliver on 2022 and also set us up for continuing to grow into the future."

            "content": "02:09 Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Gartner had a great start to 2022. In the first quarter, performance was strong across the business. We delivered growth in revenue, EBITDA, EPS, and free cash flow. We drove acceleration in contract value and our significant share repurchase program has lowered our share count. 02:29 With our strong Q1 results, we're increasing our 2022 guidance. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Gartner research provides actionable objective insight to executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. 02:46 We continue to have a vast market opportunity across all structures, sizes, and geographies. And we are delivering more value to our clients than ever before. It was a high degree of volatility and uncertainty in the world. Our clients are facing more challenging decisions than ever before. We've been incredible agile in supporting them through these trying times. 03:07 We're delivering more relevant and timely content on current pressing issues such as, successfully operating in a hybrid work environment, developing strategies to attract and retain talent, and managing supply chain disruptions. Beyond these issues, we continue to provide unparalleled insight and advise on top priorities, including transitioning to digital business, [within] [ph] diverse, equitable, and inclusive organizations, managing cyber security threats and much more. 03:36 Whether our clients are experiencing good times or bad, and regardless of role, we deliver incredible value to enterprise leaders and their teams and we have strong demand for our services. Research revenue grew 18% in Q1. Total contract value growth was 16% at the top end of our medium-term outlook. 03:56 Within our research segment, we serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global technology sales or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS contract value grew 14%. Global business sales or GPS serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal, and more. GTS contract value grew 24%. 04:27 Turning now to our conferences business, Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinary value to an engaged and highly qualified audience. Q1 is a seasonally small quarter for our conferences business, which performed as expected in the first quarter. We ran five virtual conferences in Q1. We pushed several conferences that traditionally occurred in Q1 to later in the year to facilitate bringing them in-person. 04:51 We continue to see strong demand for in-person conferences from our clients and prospects. We're taking a deliberate based approach as we return to in-person experiences. Next week, we will be hosting our first in-person conference since our pivot to virtual in 2020. The Gartner Data & Analytics Summit will run next week in London. Attendee tickets and exhibitor space has sold out for this summit. Our clients, prospects, analysts, and sales teams are eager to come together. 05:23 As we return to in-person conferences, we'll continue to leverage our profitable virtual conferences as a complement to our in-person conferences. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our [IC research business] [ph]. 05:45 Consulting revenue grew a very strong 20% in the first quarter. So, we had a great start to the year. To sustain our success over the long-term, we've made target investments in hiring and retaining top talent that are paying off. Across the company, turnover has stabilized. We expanded our recruiting capacity last year and are adding new associates at a strong pace. 06:07 In Q1, we had our highest number of new hires ever. We grew headcount 4% sequentially achieving our quarterly hiring target. We're on pace to achieve our hiring goals for 2022. The world continues to face significant challenges. Beyond the unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a terrible humanitarian crisis. Our thoughts are with all those who continue to be impacted. 06:33 Gartner is exiting the Russian market. In addition, we've established a free resource center to help leaders address a range of business issues that have emerged as a result of this crisis. 06:44 In closing, we started 2022 with strong performances. We've great momentum across the business. Whether clients are experiencing good times or bad, and regardless of role, we deliver incredible value to enterprise leaders and their teams, and we have strong demand for our services. We've a vast untapped market opportunity. 07:04 We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income. Looking ahead, we're well-positioned to drive strong top-line growth with modest margin expansion. As we invest for future growth, we'll continue to return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces our shares outstanding and increases returns in capital over time. With our strong Q1 results, we're increasing our 2022 guidance. 07:30 With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Who'll give you more detail. Craig? 22:56 Yeah, It's Gene. So, [Technical Difficulty] is going to plan and we're on track for the year [Technical Difficulty] double-digit headcount in our [Technical Difficulty] headcount. As you have more [portions] [ph] at the January [Technical Difficulty] year we've done this for long period of [Technical Difficulty]. 23:25 So, we will be [Technical Difficulty] January to your point, we [Technical Difficulty] backlog [Technical Difficulty] because of the pandemic than we've had in the [Technical Difficulty] pandemic were. So, that's [Technical Difficulty] bigger drain on quota-bearing headcount. 31:37 Hey it's Gene, I'll try again. Hopefully my line works this time. So, basically, we're very focused on improving productivity for both GTS and GBS. It's been [indiscernible] one period of time, and we have a lot of programs we talked about from time-to-time on improvement productivity. It includes things like our recruiting programs, our training programs, the tools we give our salespeople people and our processes. And what you're seeing I think, it also includes become our content to making sure on the most important issues. And I think all those things are coming together driving productivity. 32:11 In addition to that, because of our slower growth in headcount last year, we have an higher average tenure than we would have, it kind of normal time to call it pre-pandemic times. 32:22 So, those are the key factors that drive productivity. The operational changes we're making and modestly higher tenure, compared with pre-pandemic times? 32:46 Yes. Yes, we're expecting both to grow double-digit rates because of the faster contracts I've roughly seen from GBS. We'd expect that double-digit headcount to be modestly higher than GTS. 33:57 Sorry, Trevor. I would just add. The growth in the quarter was both across labor base and contract optimization. So, 14% year-over-year reported growth are our labor based revenue and 29% reported growth on the contract optimization business. 34:39 Hey, Trevor. Great question. So, the implied margin of the outlook right now is about 21.5%. The way we continue to think about it is, our normalized margin is around 20 as we think about it. We are still seeing some benefits and we are still catching up to some extent on a number of items whether it be headcount, travel, and a few other things. And so the way to think about the normalized margins moving forward is around 20%. 35:43 Hey, good morning. So, yes, as you saw we're \u2013 we flow through an incremental $70 million of revenues. And guys important to remember that we're pivoting from virtual where there was revenue expectations in-person where there was just a higher revenue expectation. So, it's not going from zero to something, it's going from a smaller number based on a virtual conference to a larger number based on an in-person conference. 36:13 As I mentioned earlier, I forgot who's question it was \u2013 it was about, it was Jeff's question about the scale of the conferences. We are running them at a little bit lower scale than we had pre-pandemic, and so our expectation on the margin flow through is not as high as it would have been pre-pandemic. That said, the margin dollar flow through is obviously more than it would be had we been running virtual. 36:46 So, the way to think about it is, we're probably in the 20% to 30% incremental margin flow through on the shift from virtual to in-person conferences is that hurts the margin percentage, but it's obviously [helpful] [ph] in terms of generating nicely more margin dollars for us going through to the bottom line. 37:28 Yes. It's slowly building. Q1 given the environment and given the fact that we weren't running too many conferences or any in-person conferences was very late. We would expect second half of the year to look more like \u201cnormal\u201d. That said, though, we are still rebuilding our conferences portfolios as we roll into years beyond 2022, there may be more travel associated with delivering those. But second half of the year, we expect to be back at a semi-normal rate of travel. But again, I think we won't get back to true normal travel levels until our conference portfolio has fully come back. 43:08 So summarizing today's call, we started 2022 with strong performances. We have great momentum across the business. With our clients who are experiencing good times or bad, and regardless of role, we can deliver incredible value to enterprise leaders and their teams. 43:23 We have strong demand for our services. We have a vast untapped market opportunity. We generate significant free cash flow and excess net income. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to drive strong top line growth with modest margin expansion. 43:38 As we invest for future growth, we'll continue to return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces our shares outstanding and increases returns on capital over time, and with our strong results we're increasing our 2022 guidance. 43:52 Thanks for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

Now I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nGene Hall: Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove another strong performance in the fourth quarter. We delivered high single-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow came in above expectations. Gartner delivers incredible client value in any macroeconomic environment. In 2023, the world experienced multiple disruptions. They impacted enterprises in dramatically different ways. For example, high interest rates affected capital-intensive industries and financial institutions such as regional banks, high inflation rates had an outsized effect on industries such as health care. Geopolitical polarization and conflict drove increases in military and defense spending while affecting supply chains, more shifts in how and where people work affected real estate, live events and entertainment and other industries. Cybersecurity attacks became even more frequent while getting stronger and more disruptive. And we saw a significant leap in the capabilities of artificial intelligence, or AI, which fueled even more complexity. We serve leaders in every enterprise across every industry and every geography. They know they need help. And they know Gartner is the best source for the help they need. Gartner delivers actionable objective insight that drive smarter decisions and stronger performance on an organization's mission-critical priorities. We guide the leaders who shape the world. Our insights often make the difference between success and failure, the leaders we work with and the enterprises they serve. As we move into 2024, our ability to execute operational best practices consistently is the strongest it's ever been. We have the lowest proportion of open positions ever. Our recruiting capability and capacity are world-class. We have a strong associate value proposition. And our teams have higher tenure than in 2023, which will allow us to drive strong performance well into the future. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. Our business remains resilient in a complex external environment. Through relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. In the fourth quarter, we help clients with a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization and more. Research revenue grew 5% in Q4. Subscription revenue represented more than 75% of our consolidated global revenue in 2023. We delivered subscription revenue growth of 8% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter. Total contract value growth was 8%. Across GTS and GBS, contract value from enterprise function leaders grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders also grew at double-digit rates. Gartner serves executives and their teams to distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs, Chief Marketing Officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 6%, led by growth with ITs and enterprise function leaders. GTS sales to leaders and technology vendors continue to be affected by technology sector dynamics. Exiting the year, we began to see some improvement. New business with tech vendors grew at high single digits. We expect new business to lead retention and contract value growth. Global Business Sales, or GBS, source leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, legal, sales and more. GBS contract value grew 13%. GBS new business was up double digits. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. 2023 was the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019. We had a great year, and we drove a strong finish in the fourth quarter. In Q4, we held some of our largest destination conferences, including IT Symposium in Orlando and Barcelona and Ravage HR in Orlando. These conferences were spectacular. Across all our destination conferences, attendance was up year-over-year with many at or near capacity. Looking ahead to 2024, advanced bookings continue to be very strong and feedback continues to be excellent. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through a deeper extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 8% for the full year. We saw growth in labor-based consulting and record results in contract optimization for the full year. We are introducing 2024 guidance, which we view as achievable across a wide range of economic and geopolitical scenarios with opportunity for upside. In closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver incredible client value, whether our clients are struggling, thriving or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success or into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time. And we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. As we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This produces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Fourth quarter revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were better than expected as we continue to execute very well in a complex environment. Our financial performance for the full year 2023 included global contract value and consolidated revenue growth of 8%, EBITDA of $1.5 billion, diluted adjusted EPS of $11.33 and free cash flow of $1.1 billion. We are introducing 2024 guidance, which we view as achievable across a wide range of economic and geopolitical scenarios with opportunity for upside. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 67%. EBITDA was $386 million, ahead of our guidance primarily as a result of disciplined cost management. Adjusted EPS was $3.04 and free cash flow was $196 million. We finished the quarter with 20,237 associates, up 5%, excluding the 2023 divestiture and about the same as Q3. We have a great team across Gartner, driven by a very compelling associate value proposition. Moving into 2024, we are in an excellent position from a talent and tenure perspective. Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% FX-neutral. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-subscription revenue performance in the quarter reflects a shift to higher-quality traffic. While this action has a short-term effect on revenue, we expect it will drive higher prices and increase revenue over time. Fourth quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with the prior year period as we have caught up on hiring and return to the new expected levels of travel. For the full year 2023, research revenues increased by 6%, both as reported and FX neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74%. Contract Value, or CV, was $4.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 8% versus the prior year. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes the first quarter 2023 divestiture. We expect new business to be a leading indicator for retention and, in turn, contract value growth. We had the highest one month of new business dollars ever in December 2023. For the fourth quarter, CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders increased double digits as well. CV from tech vendors was about flat versus the prior year and up sequentially. Tech vendor CV continued the quarterly improvement we saw in Q3. Tech vendor new business was up high single digits in Q4, marking the first year-over-year increase in 2023. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $180 million. As we've discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of the industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates led by the energy, manufacturing and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across almost all of our enterprise size categories. The small category, which has the largest tech vendor mix grew modestly. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 6% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $134 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, reflecting net growth even before the addition of new clients. In the fourth quarter, IT enterprise function leaders wallet retention was consistent with historical GTS levels. GTS new business increased 12% versus last year. New business with IT enterprise function leaders increased mid-teens compared to 2022. New business with tech vendors increased high single digits in the quarter. GTS quota-bearing head count was about flat year-over-year. With the dynamic territory planning we introduced a few years ago, the catch-up hiring we did last year and our teams moving up 10-year curve, we're well positioned for growth moving into 2024. Operationally, we are continuously allocating resources to the best near-term opportunities even as we ensure we are well positioned to capture the large addressable market opportunity over time. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $1.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. The majority of our GBS practices grew at double-digit rates. Growth was led by supply chain, legal and HR. GBS CV increased $46 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 107% for the quarter, reflecting strong net growth with our existing clients. GBS new business was up 13% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing head count was up 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the earnings supplement. As we do each year at this time, we've provided 2 years of quarterly historical contract value data updated to 2024 FX rates in the appendix of the earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $214 million, up 14% year-over-year. Contribution margin in the quarter was 50%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held 11 destination conferences in the quarter, all in person. For the full year 2023, we delivered an all-time high revenue of $505 million, which was an increase of 30% on a reported basis and 29% FX neutral. Gross contribution margin was 50%. Fourth quarter consulting revenues were $128 million compared with $138 million in 2022 when we saw a record performance in the Contract Optimization business. Consulting contribution margin was 27% in the fourth quarter, affected by revenue mix and growth hiring. Labor-based revenues were $99 million, up 3% versus Q4 of last year as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at December 31 was $162 million, increasing 21% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength. We delivered $29 million of Contract Optimization revenue in the quarter. This part of our business is highly variable. For the second half of 2023, revenues were $62 million, up from the second half of 2022 when we delivered our largest ever quarter in Q4. Full year Consulting revenue was up 7% on a reported basis and 8% FX-neutral. Gross contribution margin was 35% compared to 39% in 2022. Consolidated cost of services increased 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 10% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our future growth. SG&A increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 8% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $386 million compared to $421 million last year. Fourth quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected disciplined expense management. EBITDA for the full year was almost $1.5 billion, a 1% increase over 2022 on a reported basis and up 2% FX-neutral. Depreciation in the quarter of $26 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $19 million. This was down $9 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 24% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 15% for the quarter. The full year tax rate for the calculation of adjusted net income was 22%. Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $3.04 compared with $3.70 last year. We had 79 million shares outstanding in the fourth quarter. This is a reduction of about 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the fourth quarter with about 79 million shares on an unweighted basis. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $11.33, up modestly from 2022. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $224 million, up 10% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $28 million, down $4 million as a result of catch-up spend on technology investments in 2022, which normalize this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $196 million, up 19% compared to last year. Free cash flow for the full year was almost $1.1 billion, a 6% increase versus 2022. Free cash flow on a rolling four quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 71% of EBITDA. Adjusting for the Q1 divestiture, the full year free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income would have been 138%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. We have a new slide in the earnings supplement, which shows the conversion from both EBITDA and GAAP net income to free cash flow on a rolling four quarter basis. The past 2 years have had some unusual items affecting the conversion, including insurance proceeds related to pandemic conference cancellations and the 2023 divestiture. We expect about a 4 to 6 point difference between EBITDA margin and free cash flow margins in a typical year. The normal free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income is 140% to 160%. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had about $1.3 billion of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.3 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $158 million of stock during the fourth quarter and more than $600 million for the full year. At the end of December, we had about $1 billion of authorization for repurchases remaining, and we expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. Before providing the 2024 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2024. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. The outlook for 2024 research revenue growth is a function of three primary factors: first, 2023 ending contract value; second, the timing of growth bottoming and the slope of the reacceleration, and third, the performance of nonsubscription revenue. Starting with the research subscription revenue, which was 76% of 2023 consolidated revenue. Our guidance reflects CV bottoming and reaccelerating during 2024. First quarter and first half NCVI are important inputs to calendar 2024 revenue growth. We have taken a prudent view of NCVI phasing because Q1 is a seasonally important quarter for tech vendor renewals. With the majority of our contracts being multiyear, some haven't come up for renewal during the tech sector's recalibration. And research subscription revenue will likely bottom about one quarter after contract value growth bottoms. If new business continues to perform well and retention is better than we've incorporated into the plan, there would be upside to our guidance. The nonsubscription revenue was about 6% of consolidated revenue in 2023. In this part of the business, we help small business buyers find the best software for their needs and help sellers find customers. This adds a lot of tangible value for both groups. The outlook built into the 2024 guidance reflects a shift to higher-quality traffic sources. As I mentioned, this affects revenue in the short term, but we expect it to drive higher prices and increased revenue over time. For conferences, which was about 9% of 2023 revenue, we are basing our guidance on the 51 in-person destination conferences we have planned for 2024. We expect similar seasonality to what we saw in 2023, with Q4 the largest quarter, followed by Q2. We have very good visibility into 2024 revenue with the majority of what we've guided already under contract. This is consistent with last year and ahead of historical levels. For consulting, which was also about 9% of 2023 revenue, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization has had several very strong years. It's also seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. We've incorporated a prudent outlook for this part of the segment. We remain focused on aligning expense growth with CV growth. This is the best way for us to balance short-term margins while investing for long-term sustained double-digit growth. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect a more typical cadence than we've seen in a while. We are investing for future growth even as we have taken a prudent view of the timing of revenue flowing into the P&L. We recommend thinking about expenses sequentially with notable seasonality driven by the conferences calendar and merit increases. Our plan for mid to high single-digit sales headcount growth for 2024 reflects our commitment to invest for future growth while delivering on our margin targets. We have the recruiting capacity to go faster depending on how the year plays out, and we have other levers like increased tenure to support CV growth in 2024. At current rates, FX will be approximately neutral to growth for the full year. Our guidance for 2024 is as follows, we expect research revenue of at least $5.15 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. The research revenue guidance reflects a prudent plan for NCVI performance and the recalibration of nonsubscription part of the business. The guidance reflects subscription revenue growth in the high single digits. We expect conferences revenue of at least $560 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 10%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $530 million, which is growth of about 3% FX-neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.24 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 5%. We expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.435 billion, which results in an EBITDA margin of at least 23%. We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $10.55 per share. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.065 billion. This reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of above 140%. Our guidance is based on 79 million shares, which only assumes repurchases to offset dilution. Finally, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect to deliver EBITDA of at least $335 million. We performed well this year despite continuing global macro uncertainty and a dynamic tech vendor market. Global CV grew high single digits in the quarter with enterprise function leaders CV growing double digits. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS performance exceeded our expectations, and we introduced achievable guidance with opportunity for upside. We repurchased more than $600 million in stock during 2023 and more than $3 billion in the past 3 years. We remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand EBITDA margins modestly over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Than for. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is now open.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah, thank you. Just want to dig in first. I know it's not a huge business, but on the research nonsubscription headwinds and need for recalibration. I know it's been weak all year, but I was interpreting that previously more is like cyclical headwinds. And now it seems like you're responding more operationally to drive higher quality traffic. So just I guess, I don't know if there was like a business review or, I guess, the why now in terms of cyclicality of the business versus where there's an opportunity for operational improvement?\nCraig Safian: Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the question. I'll give it a start, and then Gene will chime in as well. I think starting with the facts, the nonsubscription part of the business was about 6% of 2023 revenue. Obviously, we have had the tech market pressure for the full year. And the way that mostly manifested itself through our results was real pressure on pricing throughout the full year. And we saw that. We adjusted coming out of Q2 earnings. And the good news is pricing has been roughly stable since we made that adjustment. In Q4, though, one of the things we're always focused on is making sure that we are providing the highest value to both sides of the equation. And with these offerings, we are essentially - small business buyers are coming to our site to learn more about what software to buy, and we actually help them with reviews and ratings and research and things of that nature. And then we're matching them to the sellers. And again, so tangible value, as we mentioned, on both sides of the equation. We're always focused on driving even more value for our clients. And so one of the things we've done is really shift our focus and prioritization to higher-quality forms of traffic. And again, short-term impact on revenues. But over the long term, we think this is good for clients on both sides of the equation will drive higher pricing over time, which will drive higher revenue, which is good for everybody. But one thing I would say just about the guidance is we've modeled in the real focus on higher quality traffic. We have not modeled in any real uptick in the pricing. Again, over the long term, we expect that to happen. We did not want to model that in, so we actually see that manifesting itself in reality.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. And then I hear you loud and clear on the better tech vendor, new business sold trends. Maybe talk through more on the retention for tech vendor, just like how you're thinking about the tail that has not yet renewed in a more difficult environment? Or just what's the typical lag time from when you've seen prior inflections in new business, like how long it kind of takes for the retention trend to similarly improved?\nGene Hall: Hi, Jeff, it's Gene. So one - the biggest issue we have is in the small tech vendors and a lot of the small tech vendors are in markets that have changed and they have difficulty getting funding now. And for those vendors, if they signed a 2 or 3 or multiyear a year or 2 ago, when that comes up for renewal, they don't have any funding. In fact, in many cases, they're out of business. And so what's happening there is that that's our biggest drag in the tech sector in terms of retention. The larger companies, as you've seen, are still laying off tens of thousands of people. And so they haven't finished restructuring. As we mentioned, overall new business is up in the tech sector, mid-single digits. And so we're thinking that's a leading indicator that retention will follow once we work through \u2013 work our way through these - particularly these companies that have gone out of business since they signed the agreement and today. And by the way, that's a very still a very robust business. It's just a different side of companies now that are getting funding, big [ph] AI.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. Actually, maybe following on a similar line to the last question. The commentary around new business in the prepared remarks, and this is beyond tech vendors. So just in general, the enterprise new business sounded very good, even the tech vendor improvement in new business sounded good. Just wanted to understand if there was anything that could - that is a risk to that sort of starting to flow through contract value in the next few quarters? And how quickly you could expect to see sort of that shift in contract value? I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you're expecting an inflection this year? Thanks.\nCraig Safian: Good morning, Toni. Thanks for the question. Just to lay out the facts. So to your point, GTS, the HT vendor part of the business, new business grew at high single-digit rates. The end user or enterprise function leader part of GTS grew new business mid-teens year-over-year, and GBS was up 13% over prior year on new business. So we actually saw a pretty strong new business results across all of the markets we sell into in the fourth quarter. And as we mentioned, we view new business as a real leading indicator for what's happening in the market in the moment, so to speak. And so again, we saw a modest improvement in new business from Q2, Q3. That continued from Q3 to Q4 with tech vendor actually growing for the first time in 2023 in the fourth quarter. As you know, NCVI and CV growth are a function of the combination of new business and retention. And as we talked about in our prepared remarks and also in response to Jeff's question, there's still a lot of pressure and Gene alluded to this as well. Still a lot of pressure on retention in the small tech vendor part of the market. And we still have a lot of renewals that haven't been touched or coming renewals that haven't been touched since the tech sector really started to recalibrate, call it third, fourth quarter of 2022. So still a little bit of retention pressure. However, new business, we definitely view as a leading indicator. Again, that's part of what gives us confidence to say that we expect CV to bottom during 2024 and start to reaccelerate during 2024 as well.\nToni Kaplan: Makes a lot of sense. And then just for a follow-up, I wanted to ask about headcount. The - I guess, what are your expectations for headcount growth in '24? And just wanted to understand a little bit more about - it seems like headcount growth has been slowing the last two quarters to like below normal levels. I know there was a catch-up in sort of the prior year and earlier in '23. So I guess, is the slower headcount sort of helping manage margin? Or is it, I guess, an indicator that there's - I don't think you're saying there's less opportunity, but just wanted to understand the sort of below normal headcount growth levels that we're seeing now?\nGene Hall: So Toni, we look at it as there's a very enormous market opportunity. We intend to capture that market opportunity over the next many years. Part of our core strategy to protect that opportunity is growing our headcount to capture it. But headcount growth is going to be faster or slower depending on the actual kind of selling capacity of the team we have. And right now, we believe we have a lot of selling capacity embedded actually in the capacity we have today. Over time, though, that's going to grow as we grow our business.\nCraig Safian: And as we mentioned during our prepared remarks, we've actually got dialed into our plan, combination GTS, GBS, quarter-bearing headcount growth of mid to high single digits. And as always, we're prepared to go faster. As both Gene and I mentioned, we have recruitment capacity to go faster if we want to. And so we've got dialed in mid to high single-digit growth in GTS and GBS, quota-bearing head count, and we can go faster if we see that rebound coming faster as well.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Heather, your line is open. Please check your mute button.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. I was muted. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the renewals on the tech vendor side and just ask you, are there any - I mean, obviously, if companies are going under, there's nothing you can control there. But what you can do on that front? And can you help us put in perspective how material the wave of renewals are? I know that something investors have been curious about.\nGene Hall: Again, if you look at the larger companies in the market, renewals are going kind of normally - it's a little slower than usual because, again, they're laying off tens of thousands of people. We expect that will change. There's plenty of demand. Again, we expect global IT spending issue to grow by 7% to almost $5 trillion. So there's plenty of demand there. We expect over time that will normalize. And so the real issue on retention is these very small tech vendors which are, over time, a great market for us, but there's a shift going on now from what used to get funding through now. What does get funding is, as I mentioned, there's a real focus on AI. And so those companies that are in less popular segments for funding these days can't get funding and if they haven't as successful commercially, they either get acquired or go out of business, in which case our retention affects our retention.\nCraig Safian: And the other thing I'd add, Heather, just on the larger tech clients, typically, what we see is a combination of maybe modestly less growth than we would normally buy or normally see through renewal cycles or modest cuts reduction to spend, but they maintain a pretty significant Gartner presence always. And what we then do is make sure that we are there to win back that business and it actually does help drive the growth coming out of tougher macro environment. And that's sort of what we've always seen in some macro environments, tech vendor or otherwise, where we'll take some mix from a retention perspective, but stay embedded, still delivering huge value to our clients and then win back and grow that business over the long term.\nHeather Balsky: And then just kind of asking another version of probably something you've already said and the same question, but you were talking about CV on the tech vendor side normalizing. Last quarter, you talked about normalizing over 12 to 18 months. Is that still your outlook based on what you saw in the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about that?\nGene Hall: So our long-term view on this segment of the business is unchanged. We believe it can grow in line with our medium-term objectives. We still believe that we are going to see reacceleration of this business over time. Whether it's 9 to 15 months or 12 to 18 or 24, it will be in that range that we actually see that reacceleration. But we - the market here is still really strong. Our offerings still drive really huge value for our clients in this segment. And over the medium term, there's no reason why this can't get back to 12% to 16% growth, consistent with our medium-term objective for the strong [ph] business.\nHeather Balsky: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nSeth Weber: Hey guys. Good morning. I think maybe first, just a clarification. When you talk about your research revenue guide, I think backing into it, it kind of implies a nonsubscription revenue growth of down - like down low double digits. Is that the right way to think about what's baked into your model?\nGene Hall: Yes, that is the correct math, Seth. You got it.\nSeth Weber: Okay. Thank you. And then just on the strong new business wins, can you just frame that a little bit? I mean, is that a function of comps are easier productivity is better? Or are you actually seeing or hearing better sentiment from your customers? Is - are the sales cycles getting shorter? It just seems like the new business wins are just really strong, and I'm just trying to tie all these things together with your guidance. Thanks.\nGene Hall: Yes. So first I'd say is we have a strong value proposition. And so when clients see the value they get from our offerings, they want to buy it. So that's fundamentally what's driving demand. And on top of that, we're always focused on things that impact sales productivity. And there's things that - and it's things like the tools that we give them, the process we have. And then as Craig mentioned in his remarks, tenure can affect you as well, we're having modest improvements in tenure as well. And so - but the fundamental thing that's driving it is really intrinsic demand for clients because they have the need for our services to get a lot of value out of them.\nSeth Weber: Right. But has sentiment - has customer sentiment changed at all over the last quarter? Has it gotten better? Or have the sales cycles changed? Or anything you'd call out for the acceleration of new business wins here?\nGene Hall: I'd say the sort of selling environment modestly improved throughout 2023.\nSeth Weber: Okay. All right. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on artificial intelligence as a driver of new business. I realize it was one of the topics Gene that you outlined at the front. Just kind of curious, is there any way to kind of quantify or maybe even subjectively talk about AI as a driver of new business, cross-sell, new conversations with clients. I understand it's part of an ever-evolving tech landscape, but I'm just wondering if there's been any boost or notable boost from that topic specifically as it relates to new client wins or new business?\nCraig Safian: Yes. So Andrew, our - we serve clients in a wide variety of areas, as you know, and they get value of all those areas. AI has had a lot of publicity over the last year. And so there is - throughout the media, et cetera. And so the - there is an unusually high level of interest in understanding what AI is and how it could affect our clients' businesses. I'd say it's just like the other things that we help our clients with. It's not something that's causing like an extra 20% of demand or something. It's an area that is one of the things we cover that clients have interest in, just clients that have cost problems, maybe have some cost optimization as opposed to AI. So it kind of depends on the situation of individual clients, but it's certainly an area of robust demand.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to hone in on the CV growth bottoming part of your guidance. I recognize that first quarter and first half NCVI are important inputs and you've been conservative. Gene, I think in the press release, you said that you had an opportunity for upside and that guidance was achievable across a wide range of economic scenarios. So just trying to putting all these pieces together, is it fair for us to assume that CV growth is bottoming in the second half in your guidance? And then upside would be from that happening earlier? Or is there some other way for us to think about the underlying assumptions there? Thank you.\nGene Hall: Yes. Good morning, Andrew. I think the way to think about the CV and the revenue, and obviously, our revenue guide for the research segment and the subscription revenue piece. The revenue is always going to lag the contract value recovery. And on top of that, as you know, first half changes to NCVI are going to have a bigger impact on the 2024 revenue runout than big step-ups in Q3 or Q4, which are great and drive great cash flow and will drive future revenue but have minimal impacts on 2024 revenue. So we're not guiding to a revenue \u2013 our CV number for the year nor are we pointing to specifically where the bottom is, but we have baked into our outlook, a bottoming of that CV and a reacceleration of that CV over the course of - over the course of 2024.\nAndrew Nicholas: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Brendan on for Manav. I just want to ask how you guys think about getting back to double-digit CV growth. Obviously, if your \u2013 your QBH is mid to high single digit. Your new business is still pretty strong. So it seems like really it's just like a wallet retention, higher cancellation issue for now. Is it just that, that kind of goes away over time? Or do you actually expect even more kind of new business productivity, if you will, from QBH or I guess, how do you guys think about that?\nGene Hall: Good morning, Brendan. I mean, the biggest thing impacting contract value and contract value growth right now is the tech vendor part of the business. And so as we mentioned, the enterprise function leader part of our business grew at double-digit growth rates in the fourth quarter and actually has been a consistent double-digit grower through the course of 2023. And so if you look at that 7.7% overall contract value growth, the reality is the enterprise function leader portion of the business, which is more than 75% of total CV is growing at double-digit growth rates. And the tech vendor portion of the business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, was essentially flat for the year. And so as we start to see a reacceleration of the tech vendor business, which again is a little less than 25% of total CV. That obviously has an impact on the overall CV growth. The other piece that I think is obviously super important is we caught up on our hiring quite a bit over the course of 2022. And so what that meant is over the course of 2023, we had a lot of people very early in their Gartner sales careers. And as you know, as people come up with tenure curve, their productivity increases. And so we feel confident that we've got enough capacity from a selling perspective heading into 2024, given the combination of tech sector rebound and probably more importantly, our salespeople coming up the tenure curve, that should provide the right amount of fuel, if you will, to drive contract value growth in 2024, and we're growing our GTS/GBS headcount mid to high single digits during 2024. And that's really about accelerating and sustaining that growth as we roll into 2025 and 2026.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just any callouts or growth rates you can give us within GBS? Obviously, it's still performing pretty well. So just anything - any other color you can give us?\nGene Hall: Yes. I mean it's still 12.9% or 13% year-over-year growth on a bigger base. And so getting bigger and bigger and sustaining growth within our medium-term objective for the segment. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, supply chain, legal, and HR are the three fastest-growing pieces of the segment. But obviously, all pieces have to be growing nicely for us to register a 13% year-over-year CV growth.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJosh Chan: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I know that you don't guide to CV trajectory or NCVI, but I guess it sounds like you are emphasizing more the tech vendor renewal dynamic here. So I guess, are we to interpret that as there being more of an impact of that on Q1 than normal. Could you just kind of explain the rationale behind calling that specific dynamic out the way you did?\nGene Hall: Yes. Good morning, Josh. Thanks for the question. So we're always looking at the skew of contract end dates and contract value associated with that. And as we've talked about in the past, generally speaking, we're pretty evenly skewed across the year. This year, we actually have a little bit of a bubble and not a huge one, but just a little bit more than average in - with our tech vendor clients in the first quarter. And so you may have heard us use the word prudent several times during our prepared remarks. We just want to make sure that our guidance reflects our most recent performance and what we know about the next couple of quarters coming up. And so we've taken a prudent view on our first half NCVI to take that into account. That said, again, I'll reiterate, we do expect CV growth overall to bottom during 2024 and begin to reaccelerate with - even with that first quarter focus on tech vendor renewals.\nJosh Chan: Okay. I appreciate the color there. That's really helpful. And if I can shift over to margins. Could you talk about the different drivers of margin year-over-year? I mean, you have positive revenue growth, you have reaccelerating CV, the cost structure seems to be in a good spot. So are there more margin pluses and minuses? And how does that reconcile with the guidance? Thank you.\nCraig Safian: Sure. Thanks, Josh. The simplest way to think about it is that with our targeted headcount growth in GTS and GBS of mid to high single digits. And think about that, not the only place that we're actually growing but growing a little bit elsewhere, combined with normal merit and wage inflation, combined with a growing conferences business. If you look at the implied operating expense in the guidance, it's up about 8% or 9% year-over-year, which aligns with the headcount growth and the conference growth that we've got dialed into the guidance. And so as we mentioned, a much more \"normal\" cadence of operating expense in 2024 as compared to prior years where we fell behind and we're catching up, et cetera, et cetera. So a much more normal quarter-to-quarter build of our operating expense. We are - the biggest thing that drives our revenue for 2024 is the ending contract value for 2023. And obviously, as we talked about on Andrew's question, the revenue will lag the recovery in contract value. And so the reality is - and again, we've been not guiding, but pointing this way for the last several quarters that this was going to be the reality for 2024, which is we're going to get back on our normal cadence of investing for the future and growing our sales force and growing other areas. We are dealing with the CV deceleration through 2023. And obviously, that has an impact on 2024 revenues. Obviously, the nonsubscription revenue performance also mutes the overall revenue as well as does the consulting growth rate, which, while still within our medium-term guidance, given we had such a strong year in contract optimization, we're being thoughtful about the growth rates there. And so it's a little bit of all of those factors impacting the top line with what I would consider \"normal\u201d operating expense growth baked into the 2024 guide.\nJosh Chan: Perfect. Thanks for the color, Craig. And thanks both for your time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies LLC. Your line is now open.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Just taking a step back, if we look at the big picture and what I would call the relative strength of the economy, why do you think the clients on the tech side aren't spending more at this point? And I guess in your conversations, what would get them to commit? Like what are they looking for at this point?\nCraig Safian: So Surinder, on the tech side, I think it's really the realcali - so it's a combination of the recalibration of that market. And also when I say recalibration down to the things Gene was talking about, where we actually have a really healthy business on the small end of tech, and there is funding flowing, but it's not flowing to the same places that it may have been a year or 2 or 3 ago. And so we're just dealing with that. And again, we're going after the opportunities where the money is or we're fishing where the fish are. But as you've seen, there are still large tech sector layoffs happening a year or almost even 15 months since they began and selling into that environment when they're in the process of cutting tens of thousands of jobs is a little more challenging than it would be if they had completely recalibrated. So I think we're still in - we're still driving huge value for the clients. They're still very important clients for us. We're going to be there to help them as they rebound and come through the recalibration. It's just going to take a little bit of time, but we're confident in the value we provide. We're confident, as I mentioned earlier, in the long-term or medium-term growth prospects for this part of the business. But the fact is they are still significantly recalibrating and we are along for that ride, so to speak.\nGene Hall: And just to add a little bit..\nCraig Safian: Please continue.\nGene Hall: When you're selling into a company that is actively making layoffs, the attention of people's focus on who they're going to lay off or whether, in fact, they're going to get laid off. And so it takes a little while - that's a much tougher - that's kind of the toughest selling environment. They'll get through that, and it will return to normal. That's the larger end. And then on the small end, Craig described very well.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then I guess if we think about that or advance that line of thinking, so as you kind of more broadly think about the business and all of these clients that you serve, so is there arguably more, I guess, cyclicality or potential volatility today in your business than maybe in prior cycles, maybe the reason being that there's more PE, VC-backed firms now that they're just a larger part of the ecosystem. So they're just more willing to make quicker strategic pivots or spending decision changes or other things. Is there something structural perhaps that we should be aware of, or at least we should be thinking about?\nGene Hall: So our perspective is there's nothing structural about it. What happened was during the pandemic, there was a pull forward of tech spending. In fact, many of the tech companies, probably most of them assume that was going to last forever, turned out it was just a pull forward. Now they're just adjusting to getting back to normal. And it's as simple as that. So unless pandemics become cyclical, I think we're in pretty good shape.\nCraig Safian: Yes. I also think, Surinder, just to sort of underscore that point. When we talk about the overall business or market opportunity, I'll focus on the market opportunity. So roughly $200 billion market opportunity. $190 billion of that is outside of the tech vendor opportunity. So we remain very focused on that big prize of $190-plus billion market opportunity serving enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS. And again, we're confident that the tech vendor market is a really strong market. But the reality is $190 million on that $200 billion market opportunity is the enterprise function leader opportunity.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJeff Silber: Thanks. I know it's late. I'll just ask one though, it's multi part. Can we talk about the pricing environment? Can you just remind us what price increases you put in for this year? Are you getting any pushback? And others in the space have been providing some breaks for extending the length of the term? Is that something you're doing as well? Thanks.\nGene Hall: Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the quick question. On the pricing side, we're a little over 4%. We did our price increase in November of this year, which is when we typically do it. A little bit lower than what we did in '21 and '22, largely because we've seen inflation come down a little bit, most importantly, wage inflation come down a little bit. And so we're in that around 4%, a little bit more than 4%. I think clients, by and large, are not pushing back on it. Again, remember, the average spend per client is order of magnitude, $250,000. So the difference between a 3% or 4% increase is pretty de minimis. And again, and we're very focused on making sure that our products and services have incremental value each and every year. And we're continuing to sell with our upfront invoicing and a real focus on that. We're continuing to sell more and more multiyear contracts with our focus on that. And so I'd say, yes, the environment has been a little tougher, but we've been managing to stick to our guns on the things that we know drive huge economic value for the business, which is sticking to our pricing guns, not discounting, selling multiyear contracts and making sure we get the invoicing done upfront. And I think our teams have done a phenomenal job of sticking to our coordinating there.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. You mentioned 1Q tech vendor renewals are especially important because of a little bubble there. Can you help quantify that? How much concentration is there compared to other quarters in the year?\nCraig Safian: Yes. I think - I mean, again, remember, our tech vendor CV is a little less than 25% of total CV. Normally, Q1 represents a little bit more than 25% of total renewals on the overall franchise. This year, with tech vendors, it's in the low to mid 30% of overall CV. So it's not a huge bubble. It's just a little bit of an overweighting more than normal in the first quarter.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then you're guiding to EBITDA margins of 23% for the year. What do you see as the major driver of potential upside to that target?\nCraig Safian: I think at this point, George, it's revenue upside will drive the biggest potential for margin upside from that 23%. As we've talked about - I can't remember whose question it was, I think it was Josh's question, the OpEx is - again, forgive me for using this term, more normal than it has been for the last few years. We're back on our territory growth planning. We're back on our more normal merit increases kicking in on April 1. And so I feel really - we feel really good about the OpEx plan we got. And so I think revenue upside across the various business lines would be the place that could potentially unlock a little bit of margin upside. That said, if we are doing better from a revenue perspective, and again, Gene and I both alluded to this, we've got recruitment capacity to go faster. And so we want to make sure that not only are we doing well in 2024 that we are setting ourselves up to continue to perform really strongly in '25 and '26. And so if we have the opportunity to go a little bit faster on GTS and GBS headcount growth, we're going to take that opportunity for sure.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Gene Hall for closing remarks.\nGene Hall: So here are the takeaways for today's call. Gartner drove another strong performance in Q4. We deliver incredible value, whether our clients are struggling, thriving or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. As we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Fourth quarter revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were better than expected as we continue to execute very well in a complex environment. Our financial performance for the full year 2023 included global contract value and consolidated revenue growth of 8%, EBITDA of $1.5 billion, diluted adjusted EPS of $11.33 and free cash flow of $1.1 billion. We are introducing 2024 guidance, which we view as achievable across a wide range of economic and geopolitical scenarios with opportunity for upside. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 67%. EBITDA was $386 million, ahead of our guidance primarily as a result of disciplined cost management. Adjusted EPS was $3.04 and free cash flow was $196 million. We finished the quarter with 20,237 associates, up 5%, excluding the 2023 divestiture and about the same as Q3. We have a great team across Gartner, driven by a very compelling associate value proposition. Moving into 2024, we are in an excellent position from a talent and tenure perspective. Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% FX-neutral. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an organic FX-neutral basis. Non-subscription revenue performance in the quarter reflects a shift to higher-quality traffic. While this action has a short-term effect on revenue, we expect it will drive higher prices and increase revenue over time. Fourth quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with the prior year period as we have caught up on hiring and return to the new expected levels of travel. For the full year 2023, research revenues increased by 6%, both as reported and FX neutral. The gross contribution margin for the year was 74%. Contract Value, or CV, was $4.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 8% versus the prior year. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes the first quarter 2023 divestiture. We expect new business to be a leading indicator for retention and, in turn, contract value growth. We had the highest one month of new business dollars ever in December 2023. For the fourth quarter, CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders increased double digits as well. CV from tech vendors was about flat versus the prior year and up sequentially. Tech vendor CV continued the quarterly improvement we saw in Q3. Tech vendor new business was up high single digits in Q4, marking the first year-over-year increase in 2023. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $180 million. As we've discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of the industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates led by the energy, manufacturing and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across almost all of our enterprise size categories. The small category, which has the largest tech vendor mix grew modestly. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 6% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $134 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, reflecting net growth even before the addition of new clients. In the fourth quarter, IT enterprise function leaders wallet retention was consistent with historical GTS levels. GTS new business increased 12% versus last year. New business with IT enterprise function leaders increased mid-teens compared to 2022. New business with tech vendors increased high single digits in the quarter. GTS quota-bearing head count was about flat year-over-year. With the dynamic territory planning we introduced a few years ago, the catch-up hiring we did last year and our teams moving up 10-year curve, we're well positioned for growth moving into 2024. Operationally, we are continuously allocating resources to the best near-term opportunities even as we ensure we are well positioned to capture the large addressable market opportunity over time. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $1.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. The majority of our GBS practices grew at double-digit rates. Growth was led by supply chain, legal and HR. GBS CV increased $46 million from the third quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 107% for the quarter, reflecting strong net growth with our existing clients. GBS new business was up 13% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing head count was up 8% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the earnings supplement. As we do each year at this time, we've provided 2 years of quarterly historical contract value data updated to 2024 FX rates in the appendix of the earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the fourth quarter was $214 million, up 14% year-over-year. Contribution margin in the quarter was 50%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held 11 destination conferences in the quarter, all in person. For the full year 2023, we delivered an all-time high revenue of $505 million, which was an increase of 30% on a reported basis and 29% FX neutral. Gross contribution margin was 50%. Fourth quarter consulting revenues were $128 million compared with $138 million in 2022 when we saw a record performance in the Contract Optimization business. Consulting contribution margin was 27% in the fourth quarter, affected by revenue mix and growth hiring. Labor-based revenues were $99 million, up 3% versus Q4 of last year as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at December 31 was $162 million, increasing 21% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength. We delivered $29 million of Contract Optimization revenue in the quarter. This part of our business is highly variable. For the second half of 2023, revenues were $62 million, up from the second half of 2022 when we delivered our largest ever quarter in Q4. Full year Consulting revenue was up 7% on a reported basis and 8% FX-neutral. Gross contribution margin was 35% compared to 39% in 2022. Consolidated cost of services increased 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 10% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our future growth. SG&A increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as reported and 8% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $386 million compared to $421 million last year. Fourth quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected disciplined expense management. EBITDA for the full year was almost $1.5 billion, a 1% increase over 2022 on a reported basis and up 2% FX-neutral. Depreciation in the quarter of $26 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $19 million. This was down $9 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 24% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 15% for the quarter. The full year tax rate for the calculation of adjusted net income was 22%. Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $3.04 compared with $3.70 last year. We had 79 million shares outstanding in the fourth quarter. This is a reduction of about 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the fourth quarter with about 79 million shares on an unweighted basis. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $11.33, up modestly from 2022. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $224 million, up 10% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $28 million, down $4 million as a result of catch-up spend on technology investments in 2022, which normalize this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $196 million, up 19% compared to last year. Free cash flow for the full year was almost $1.1 billion, a 6% increase versus 2022. Free cash flow on a rolling four quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 71% of EBITDA. Adjusting for the Q1 divestiture, the full year free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income would have been 138%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. We have a new slide in the earnings supplement, which shows the conversion from both EBITDA and GAAP net income to free cash flow on a rolling four quarter basis. The past 2 years have had some unusual items affecting the conversion, including insurance proceeds related to pandemic conference cancellations and the 2023 divestiture. We expect about a 4 to 6 point difference between EBITDA margin and free cash flow margins in a typical year. The normal free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income is 140% to 160%. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had about $1.3 billion of cash. Our December 31 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.3 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $158 million of stock during the fourth quarter and more than $600 million for the full year. At the end of December, we had about $1 billion of authorization for repurchases remaining, and we expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. Before providing the 2024 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2024. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. The outlook for 2024 research revenue growth is a function of three primary factors: first, 2023 ending contract value; second, the timing of growth bottoming and the slope of the reacceleration, and third, the performance of nonsubscription revenue. Starting with the research subscription revenue, which was 76% of 2023 consolidated revenue. Our guidance reflects CV bottoming and reaccelerating during 2024. First quarter and first half NCVI are important inputs to calendar 2024 revenue growth. We have taken a prudent view of NCVI phasing because Q1 is a seasonally important quarter for tech vendor renewals. With the majority of our contracts being multiyear, some haven't come up for renewal during the tech sector's recalibration. And research subscription revenue will likely bottom about one quarter after contract value growth bottoms. If new business continues to perform well and retention is better than we've incorporated into the plan, there would be upside to our guidance. The nonsubscription revenue was about 6% of consolidated revenue in 2023. In this part of the business, we help small business buyers find the best software for their needs and help sellers find customers. This adds a lot of tangible value for both groups. The outlook built into the 2024 guidance reflects a shift to higher-quality traffic sources. As I mentioned, this affects revenue in the short term, but we expect it to drive higher prices and increased revenue over time. For conferences, which was about 9% of 2023 revenue, we are basing our guidance on the 51 in-person destination conferences we have planned for 2024. We expect similar seasonality to what we saw in 2023, with Q4 the largest quarter, followed by Q2. We have very good visibility into 2024 revenue with the majority of what we've guided already under contract. This is consistent with last year and ahead of historical levels. For consulting, which was also about 9% of 2023 revenue, we have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization has had several very strong years. It's also seasonally slower in the first quarter and remains highly variable. We've incorporated a prudent outlook for this part of the segment. We remain focused on aligning expense growth with CV growth. This is the best way for us to balance short-term margins while investing for long-term sustained double-digit growth. Our base level assumptions for consolidated expenses reflect a more typical cadence than we've seen in a while. We are investing for future growth even as we have taken a prudent view of the timing of revenue flowing into the P&L. We recommend thinking about expenses sequentially with notable seasonality driven by the conferences calendar and merit increases. Our plan for mid to high single-digit sales headcount growth for 2024 reflects our commitment to invest for future growth while delivering on our margin targets. We have the recruiting capacity to go faster depending on how the year plays out, and we have other levers like increased tenure to support CV growth in 2024. At current rates, FX will be approximately neutral to growth for the full year. Our guidance for 2024 is as follows, we expect research revenue of at least $5.15 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. The research revenue guidance reflects a prudent plan for NCVI performance and the recalibration of nonsubscription part of the business. The guidance reflects subscription revenue growth in the high single digits. We expect conferences revenue of at least $560 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 10%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $530 million, which is growth of about 3% FX-neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.24 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 5%. We expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.435 billion, which results in an EBITDA margin of at least 23%. We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $10.55 per share. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.065 billion. This reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of above 140%. Our guidance is based on 79 million shares, which only assumes repurchases to offset dilution. Finally, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect to deliver EBITDA of at least $335 million. We performed well this year despite continuing global macro uncertainty and a dynamic tech vendor market. Global CV grew high single digits in the quarter with enterprise function leaders CV growing double digits. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS performance exceeded our expectations, and we introduced achievable guidance with opportunity for upside. We repurchased more than $600 million in stock during 2023 and more than $3 billion in the past 3 years. We remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand EBITDA margins modestly over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the question. I'll give it a start, and then Gene will chime in as well. I think starting with the facts, the nonsubscription part of the business was about 6% of 2023 revenue. Obviously, we have had the tech market pressure for the full year. And the way that mostly manifested itself through our results was real pressure on pricing throughout the full year. And we saw that. We adjusted coming out of Q2 earnings. And the good news is pricing has been roughly stable since we made that adjustment. In Q4, though, one of the things we're always focused on is making sure that we are providing the highest value to both sides of the equation. And with these offerings, we are essentially - small business buyers are coming to our site to learn more about what software to buy, and we actually help them with reviews and ratings and research and things of that nature. And then we're matching them to the sellers. And again, so tangible value, as we mentioned, on both sides of the equation. We're always focused on driving even more value for our clients. And so one of the things we've done is really shift our focus and prioritization to higher-quality forms of traffic. And again, short-term impact on revenues. But over the long term, we think this is good for clients on both sides of the equation will drive higher pricing over time, which will drive higher revenue, which is good for everybody. But one thing I would say just about the guidance is we've modeled in the real focus on higher quality traffic. We have not modeled in any real uptick in the pricing. Again, over the long term, we expect that to happen. We did not want to model that in, so we actually see that manifesting itself in reality. Good morning, Toni. Thanks for the question. Just to lay out the facts. So to your point, GTS, the HT vendor part of the business, new business grew at high single-digit rates. The end user or enterprise function leader part of GTS grew new business mid-teens year-over-year, and GBS was up 13% over prior year on new business. So we actually saw a pretty strong new business results across all of the markets we sell into in the fourth quarter. And as we mentioned, we view new business as a real leading indicator for what's happening in the market in the moment, so to speak. And so again, we saw a modest improvement in new business from Q2, Q3. That continued from Q3 to Q4 with tech vendor actually growing for the first time in 2023 in the fourth quarter. As you know, NCVI and CV growth are a function of the combination of new business and retention. And as we talked about in our prepared remarks and also in response to Jeff's question, there's still a lot of pressure and Gene alluded to this as well. Still a lot of pressure on retention in the small tech vendor part of the market. And we still have a lot of renewals that haven't been touched or coming renewals that haven't been touched since the tech sector really started to recalibrate, call it third, fourth quarter of 2022. So still a little bit of retention pressure. However, new business, we definitely view as a leading indicator. Again, that's part of what gives us confidence to say that we expect CV to bottom during 2024 and start to reaccelerate during 2024 as well. And as we mentioned during our prepared remarks, we've actually got dialed into our plan, combination GTS, GBS, quarter-bearing headcount growth of mid to high single digits. And as always, we're prepared to go faster. As both Gene and I mentioned, we have recruitment capacity to go faster if we want to. And so we've got dialed in mid to high single-digit growth in GTS and GBS, quota-bearing head count, and we can go faster if we see that rebound coming faster as well. And the other thing I'd add, Heather, just on the larger tech clients, typically, what we see is a combination of maybe modestly less growth than we would normally buy or normally see through renewal cycles or modest cuts reduction to spend, but they maintain a pretty significant Gartner presence always. And what we then do is make sure that we are there to win back that business and it actually does help drive the growth coming out of tougher macro environment. And that's sort of what we've always seen in some macro environments, tech vendor or otherwise, where we'll take some mix from a retention perspective, but stay embedded, still delivering huge value to our clients and then win back and grow that business over the long term. Yes. So Andrew, our - we serve clients in a wide variety of areas, as you know, and they get value of all those areas. AI has had a lot of publicity over the last year. And so there is - throughout the media, et cetera. And so the - there is an unusually high level of interest in understanding what AI is and how it could affect our clients' businesses. I'd say it's just like the other things that we help our clients with. It's not something that's causing like an extra 20% of demand or something. It's an area that is one of the things we cover that clients have interest in, just clients that have cost problems, maybe have some cost optimization as opposed to AI. So it kind of depends on the situation of individual clients, but it's certainly an area of robust demand. Sure. Thanks, Josh. The simplest way to think about it is that with our targeted headcount growth in GTS and GBS of mid to high single digits. And think about that, not the only place that we're actually growing but growing a little bit elsewhere, combined with normal merit and wage inflation, combined with a growing conferences business. If you look at the implied operating expense in the guidance, it's up about 8% or 9% year-over-year, which aligns with the headcount growth and the conference growth that we've got dialed into the guidance. And so as we mentioned, a much more \"normal\" cadence of operating expense in 2024 as compared to prior years where we fell behind and we're catching up, et cetera, et cetera. So a much more normal quarter-to-quarter build of our operating expense. We are - the biggest thing that drives our revenue for 2024 is the ending contract value for 2023. And obviously, as we talked about on Andrew's question, the revenue will lag the recovery in contract value. And so the reality is - and again, we've been not guiding, but pointing this way for the last several quarters that this was going to be the reality for 2024, which is we're going to get back on our normal cadence of investing for the future and growing our sales force and growing other areas. We are dealing with the CV deceleration through 2023. And obviously, that has an impact on 2024 revenues. Obviously, the nonsubscription revenue performance also mutes the overall revenue as well as does the consulting growth rate, which, while still within our medium-term guidance, given we had such a strong year in contract optimization, we're being thoughtful about the growth rates there. And so it's a little bit of all of those factors impacting the top line with what I would consider \"normal\u201d operating expense growth baked into the 2024 guide. So Surinder, on the tech side, I think it's really the realcali - so it's a combination of the recalibration of that market. And also when I say recalibration down to the things Gene was talking about, where we actually have a really healthy business on the small end of tech, and there is funding flowing, but it's not flowing to the same places that it may have been a year or 2 or 3 ago. And so we're just dealing with that. And again, we're going after the opportunities where the money is or we're fishing where the fish are. But as you've seen, there are still large tech sector layoffs happening a year or almost even 15 months since they began and selling into that environment when they're in the process of cutting tens of thousands of jobs is a little more challenging than it would be if they had completely recalibrated. So I think we're still in - we're still driving huge value for the clients. They're still very important clients for us. We're going to be there to help them as they rebound and come through the recalibration. It's just going to take a little bit of time, but we're confident in the value we provide. We're confident, as I mentioned earlier, in the long-term or medium-term growth prospects for this part of the business. But the fact is they are still significantly recalibrating and we are along for that ride, so to speak. Please continue. Yes. I also think, Surinder, just to sort of underscore that point. When we talk about the overall business or market opportunity, I'll focus on the market opportunity. So roughly $200 billion market opportunity. $190 billion of that is outside of the tech vendor opportunity. So we remain very focused on that big prize of $190-plus billion market opportunity serving enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS. And again, we're confident that the tech vendor market is a really strong market. But the reality is $190 million on that $200 billion market opportunity is the enterprise function leader opportunity. Yes. I think - I mean, again, remember, our tech vendor CV is a little less than 25% of total CV. Normally, Q1 represents a little bit more than 25% of total renewals on the overall franchise. This year, with tech vendors, it's in the low to mid 30% of overall CV. So it's not a huge bubble. It's just a little bit of an overweighting more than normal in the first quarter. I think at this point, George, it's revenue upside will drive the biggest potential for margin upside from that 23%. As we've talked about - I can't remember whose question it was, I think it was Josh's question, the OpEx is - again, forgive me for using this term, more normal than it has been for the last few years. We're back on our territory growth planning. We're back on our more normal merit increases kicking in on April 1. And so I feel really - we feel really good about the OpEx plan we got. And so I think revenue upside across the various business lines would be the place that could potentially unlock a little bit of margin upside. That said, if we are doing better from a revenue perspective, and again, Gene and I both alluded to this, we've got recruitment capacity to go faster. And so we want to make sure that not only are we doing well in 2024 that we are setting ourselves up to continue to perform really strongly in '25 and '26. And so if we have the opportunity to go a little bit faster on GTS and GBS headcount growth, we're going to take that opportunity for sure."

            "name": "Gene Hall",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove another strong performance in the fourth quarter. We delivered high single-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow came in above expectations. Gartner delivers incredible client value in any macroeconomic environment. In 2023, the world experienced multiple disruptions. They impacted enterprises in dramatically different ways. For example, high interest rates affected capital-intensive industries and financial institutions such as regional banks, high inflation rates had an outsized effect on industries such as health care. Geopolitical polarization and conflict drove increases in military and defense spending while affecting supply chains, more shifts in how and where people work affected real estate, live events and entertainment and other industries. Cybersecurity attacks became even more frequent while getting stronger and more disruptive. And we saw a significant leap in the capabilities of artificial intelligence, or AI, which fueled even more complexity. We serve leaders in every enterprise across every industry and every geography. They know they need help. And they know Gartner is the best source for the help they need. Gartner delivers actionable objective insight that drive smarter decisions and stronger performance on an organization's mission-critical priorities. We guide the leaders who shape the world. Our insights often make the difference between success and failure, the leaders we work with and the enterprises they serve. As we move into 2024, our ability to execute operational best practices consistently is the strongest it's ever been. We have the lowest proportion of open positions ever. Our recruiting capability and capacity are world-class. We have a strong associate value proposition. And our teams have higher tenure than in 2023, which will allow us to drive strong performance well into the future. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. Our business remains resilient in a complex external environment. Through relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. In the fourth quarter, we help clients with a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization and more. Research revenue grew 5% in Q4. Subscription revenue represented more than 75% of our consolidated global revenue in 2023. We delivered subscription revenue growth of 8% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter. Total contract value growth was 8%. Across GTS and GBS, contract value from enterprise function leaders grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders also grew at double-digit rates. Gartner serves executives and their teams to distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs, Chief Marketing Officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 6%, led by growth with ITs and enterprise function leaders. GTS sales to leaders and technology vendors continue to be affected by technology sector dynamics. Exiting the year, we began to see some improvement. New business with tech vendors grew at high single digits. We expect new business to lead retention and contract value growth. Global Business Sales, or GBS, source leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, legal, sales and more. GBS contract value grew 13%. GBS new business was up double digits. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. 2023 was the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019. We had a great year, and we drove a strong finish in the fourth quarter. In Q4, we held some of our largest destination conferences, including IT Symposium in Orlando and Barcelona and Ravage HR in Orlando. These conferences were spectacular. Across all our destination conferences, attendance was up year-over-year with many at or near capacity. Looking ahead to 2024, advanced bookings continue to be very strong and feedback continues to be excellent. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through a deeper extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 8% for the full year. We saw growth in labor-based consulting and record results in contract optimization for the full year. We are introducing 2024 guidance, which we view as achievable across a wide range of economic and geopolitical scenarios with opportunity for upside. In closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver incredible client value, whether our clients are struggling, thriving or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success or into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time. And we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. As we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This produces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Hi, Jeff, it's Gene. So one - the biggest issue we have is in the small tech vendors and a lot of the small tech vendors are in markets that have changed and they have difficulty getting funding now. And for those vendors, if they signed a 2 or 3 or multiyear a year or 2 ago, when that comes up for renewal, they don't have any funding. In fact, in many cases, they're out of business. And so what's happening there is that that's our biggest drag in the tech sector in terms of retention. The larger companies, as you've seen, are still laying off tens of thousands of people. And so they haven't finished restructuring. As we mentioned, overall new business is up in the tech sector, mid-single digits. And so we're thinking that's a leading indicator that retention will follow once we work through \u2013 work our way through these - particularly these companies that have gone out of business since they signed the agreement and today. And by the way, that's a very still a very robust business. It's just a different side of companies now that are getting funding, big [ph] AI. So Toni, we look at it as there's a very enormous market opportunity. We intend to capture that market opportunity over the next many years. Part of our core strategy to protect that opportunity is growing our headcount to capture it. But headcount growth is going to be faster or slower depending on the actual kind of selling capacity of the team we have. And right now, we believe we have a lot of selling capacity embedded actually in the capacity we have today. Over time, though, that's going to grow as we grow our business. Again, if you look at the larger companies in the market, renewals are going kind of normally - it's a little slower than usual because, again, they're laying off tens of thousands of people. We expect that will change. There's plenty of demand. Again, we expect global IT spending issue to grow by 7% to almost $5 trillion. So there's plenty of demand there. We expect over time that will normalize. And so the real issue on retention is these very small tech vendors which are, over time, a great market for us, but there's a shift going on now from what used to get funding through now. What does get funding is, as I mentioned, there's a real focus on AI. And so those companies that are in less popular segments for funding these days can't get funding and if they haven't as successful commercially, they either get acquired or go out of business, in which case our retention affects our retention. So our long-term view on this segment of the business is unchanged. We believe it can grow in line with our medium-term objectives. We still believe that we are going to see reacceleration of this business over time. Whether it's 9 to 15 months or 12 to 18 or 24, it will be in that range that we actually see that reacceleration. But we - the market here is still really strong. Our offerings still drive really huge value for our clients in this segment. And over the medium term, there's no reason why this can't get back to 12% to 16% growth, consistent with our medium-term objective for the strong [ph] business. Yes, that is the correct math, Seth. You got it. Yes. So first I'd say is we have a strong value proposition. And so when clients see the value they get from our offerings, they want to buy it. So that's fundamentally what's driving demand. And on top of that, we're always focused on things that impact sales productivity. And there's things that - and it's things like the tools that we give them, the process we have. And then as Craig mentioned in his remarks, tenure can affect you as well, we're having modest improvements in tenure as well. And so - but the fundamental thing that's driving it is really intrinsic demand for clients because they have the need for our services to get a lot of value out of them. I'd say the sort of selling environment modestly improved throughout 2023. Yes. Good morning, Andrew. I think the way to think about the CV and the revenue, and obviously, our revenue guide for the research segment and the subscription revenue piece. The revenue is always going to lag the contract value recovery. And on top of that, as you know, first half changes to NCVI are going to have a bigger impact on the 2024 revenue runout than big step-ups in Q3 or Q4, which are great and drive great cash flow and will drive future revenue but have minimal impacts on 2024 revenue. So we're not guiding to a revenue \u2013 our CV number for the year nor are we pointing to specifically where the bottom is, but we have baked into our outlook, a bottoming of that CV and a reacceleration of that CV over the course of - over the course of 2024. Good morning, Brendan. I mean, the biggest thing impacting contract value and contract value growth right now is the tech vendor part of the business. And so as we mentioned, the enterprise function leader part of our business grew at double-digit growth rates in the fourth quarter and actually has been a consistent double-digit grower through the course of 2023. And so if you look at that 7.7% overall contract value growth, the reality is the enterprise function leader portion of the business, which is more than 75% of total CV is growing at double-digit growth rates. And the tech vendor portion of the business, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, was essentially flat for the year. And so as we start to see a reacceleration of the tech vendor business, which again is a little less than 25% of total CV. That obviously has an impact on the overall CV growth. The other piece that I think is obviously super important is we caught up on our hiring quite a bit over the course of 2022. And so what that meant is over the course of 2023, we had a lot of people very early in their Gartner sales careers. And as you know, as people come up with tenure curve, their productivity increases. And so we feel confident that we've got enough capacity from a selling perspective heading into 2024, given the combination of tech sector rebound and probably more importantly, our salespeople coming up the tenure curve, that should provide the right amount of fuel, if you will, to drive contract value growth in 2024, and we're growing our GTS/GBS headcount mid to high single digits during 2024. And that's really about accelerating and sustaining that growth as we roll into 2025 and 2026. Yes. I mean it's still 12.9% or 13% year-over-year growth on a bigger base. And so getting bigger and bigger and sustaining growth within our medium-term objective for the segment. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, supply chain, legal, and HR are the three fastest-growing pieces of the segment. But obviously, all pieces have to be growing nicely for us to register a 13% year-over-year CV growth. Yes. Good morning, Josh. Thanks for the question. So we're always looking at the skew of contract end dates and contract value associated with that. And as we've talked about in the past, generally speaking, we're pretty evenly skewed across the year. This year, we actually have a little bit of a bubble and not a huge one, but just a little bit more than average in - with our tech vendor clients in the first quarter. And so you may have heard us use the word prudent several times during our prepared remarks. We just want to make sure that our guidance reflects our most recent performance and what we know about the next couple of quarters coming up. And so we've taken a prudent view on our first half NCVI to take that into account. That said, again, I'll reiterate, we do expect CV growth overall to bottom during 2024 and begin to reaccelerate with - even with that first quarter focus on tech vendor renewals. And just to add a little bit.. When you're selling into a company that is actively making layoffs, the attention of people's focus on who they're going to lay off or whether, in fact, they're going to get laid off. And so it takes a little while - that's a much tougher - that's kind of the toughest selling environment. They'll get through that, and it will return to normal. That's the larger end. And then on the small end, Craig described very well. So our perspective is there's nothing structural about it. What happened was during the pandemic, there was a pull forward of tech spending. In fact, many of the tech companies, probably most of them assume that was going to last forever, turned out it was just a pull forward. Now they're just adjusting to getting back to normal. And it's as simple as that. So unless pandemics become cyclical, I think we're in pretty good shape. Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for the quick question. On the pricing side, we're a little over 4%. We did our price increase in November of this year, which is when we typically do it. A little bit lower than what we did in '21 and '22, largely because we've seen inflation come down a little bit, most importantly, wage inflation come down a little bit. And so we're in that around 4%, a little bit more than 4%. I think clients, by and large, are not pushing back on it. Again, remember, the average spend per client is order of magnitude, $250,000. So the difference between a 3% or 4% increase is pretty de minimis. And again, and we're very focused on making sure that our products and services have incremental value each and every year. And we're continuing to sell with our upfront invoicing and a real focus on that. We're continuing to sell more and more multiyear contracts with our focus on that. And so I'd say, yes, the environment has been a little tougher, but we've been managing to stick to our guns on the things that we know drive huge economic value for the business, which is sticking to our pricing guns, not discounting, selling multiyear contracts and making sure we get the invoicing done upfront. And I think our teams have done a phenomenal job of sticking to our coordinating there. So here are the takeaways for today's call. Gartner drove another strong performance in Q4. We deliver incredible value, whether our clients are struggling, thriving or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. As we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nGene Hall: Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove another strong performance in Q3. We delivered high signal digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA, and adjusted EPS came in above expectations. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent. The external environment remains volatile and uncertain. The tech sector is still adjusting to post pandemic demand. The banking industry continues to grapple with rising interest rates. Supply chain challenges are still impacting many industries. There's heightened geopolitical volatility and more. Leaders know they need help and they know Gartner is the best source for that help.  Gartner delivers actionable objective insight that smarter decisions and stronger performance on our client's mission critical priorities. Whether they're thriving, struggling, or anywhere in between. Our insights, tools and advice often mean the difference between success and failure for leaders and the enterprises they serve. We continue to be agile and adapt to the changing environment. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. We guide leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast, across all sectors, sizes and geographies.  We estimate our opportunity at around $200 billion. In the third quarter, we continue to help clients with a wide range of topics such as cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization, and more. In the third quarter, research revenue grew 5%. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an organic basis, 20 contract value growth was 8%. Contract value for enterprise function leaders continue to grow at double digit rates.  We serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels, global technology sales, or GTS source leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also source leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs, Chief Marketing Officers, and Senior Product Leaders. GTS contract valued grew 7%. GTS sales to enterprise function leaders performed well in the quarter. GTS sales to leaders at technology vendors were affected by technology sector dynamics and tough year over year comparisons.  We expect sales to technology vendors will return to normal growth rates over the next 12 months to 18 months. Global business sales or GBS serve leaders in their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 14%. Through a relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. Our business remains resilient despite a persistent, complicated external environment and tough compares for the technology vendor market.  Gartner conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. This will be the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019. We're having a great year. In-person attendance and advanced bookings are at record levels. The fourth quarter is off to a great start and our outlook for the year remains strong.  IT Symposium Expo is our flagship conference series. I recently attended this conference in Orlando. Attendance was strong. Our sales teams were highly engaged with clients and prospects, and feedback from the conference continues to be excellent. Gartner consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project-based work.  Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 23% in the third quarter with record results and contract optimization. Given the strong performances across our business, we've increased our 2023 guidance for revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Greg will take you through the details.  We're well positioned to have strong close to the year and get off to a fast start in 2024. In closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver unparalleled value to enterprise leaders and their teams across every major function, whether they're thriving, struggling, or anywhere in between. We're essentially agile and continuously adapt to the changing world. We know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to continue our strong record of success far into the future.  Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term, sustained, double-digit revenue growth. We would fit margins will expand modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. Even as we invest for future growth, we will return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns overtime. With that, I will hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Third quarter results were strong with high single-digit growth in contract value. Revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were better-than-expected with outstanding performance in consulting and disciplined cost management. With strong results in the quarter and good visibility into Q4, we are increasing our 2023 guidance. Third quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, up 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, compared to 69% in the prior year, as the 2022 hiring catch-up continue to flow through the P&L as expected. EBITDA was $333 million ahead of our guidance and about inline with last year. Adjusted EPS was $2.56, up 6% from Q3 of last year. And free cash flow was $302 million. We have finished the quarter with 20,253 associates, up 6% from the prior year and 1% from the end of the second quarter. We remain well-positioned from a talent perspective, as our associates continue to move up the tenure curve. Research revenue in the third quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% on an FX neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an organic FX neutral basis. Non-subscription revenue performance was similar to Q2. Third quarter research contribution was 73%, compared to 74% in the prior year period, as we have caught up on hiring and returned to the new expected levels of travel. Contract value or CV was $4.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 8% versus the prior year. The third quarter last year was a very strong research quarter with outstanding performance across most key metrics. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes the first quarter 2023 divestiture. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS, grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders increased double-digits as well. CV from tech vendors grew low single-digits, compared to mid-teens growth in the third quarter of 2022. Quarterly net contract value increase or NCVI was $101 million. As we have discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes, and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of the industry sectors grew at double-digit rates, led by the transportation, services, and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories other than the small category, which has the largest tech vendor mix, and grew low single-digits. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our Top 10 countries. Global Technology sales contract value was $3.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $65 million from the second quarter. Wallet retention for GTS was 102% for the quarter, which compares to 107% in the prior year, when we saw a near record high for this metric.  IT Enterprise function leaders while retention remained above historical GTS levels during the third quarter. GTS new business was up 7% versus last year. New business with IT enterprise function leaders increased mid-teens compared to the prior year. GTS quota bearing headcount was up 5% year-over-year. With the dynamic territory planning we introduced a few years ago. The catch up hiring we did last year and our teams moving up the 10-year curve we're well-positioned for growth moving into 2024.  Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earning supplement. Global business sales contract value was $1 billion at the end of the third quarter up 14% year-over-year. All of our GBS practices grew a double-digit or high single-digit rates other than sales, which grew mid-single digits. Growth was again led by supply chain and HR. GBS CV increased $36 million from the second quarter, while retention for GBS was 108% for the quarter, which compares to 114% in the prior year when we saw one of the highest ever results for this metric. GBS new business was up 10% compared to last year. GBS quota bearing headcount was up 10% year-over-year. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earning supplement. Conferences revenue for the third quarter was $57 million ahead of our expectations during a seasonally small period, we delivered strong growth for the conferences we held in Q3 compared to the same conferences in 2022.  The calendar shifted significantly from 2022 to 2023 with the return to in-person. Contribution margin in the quarter was 36% consistent with typical seasonality and reflecting investments for future growth. We held nine destination conferences in the quarter, all in person. Third quarter consulting revenues increased by 24% year-over-year to $133 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 23%. Consulting contribution margin was 37% in the third quarter. Labor-based revenues were $100 million up 10% versus Q3 of last year, as reported and on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at June 30th was $180 million, increasing 15% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with continued booking straight. Our contract optimization business is highly valuable.  We delivered $33 million of revenue in the quarter with some of the revenue pulled forward from the fourth quarter relative to our prior outlook. Consolidated cost of services increased 8% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and 7% on an FX neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher head counts to support our future growth. SG&A increased 8% year-over-year in the third quarters reported and 7% on an FX neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth.  EBITDA for the third quarter was $333 million, about in line with last year. Third quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected revenue exceeding our expectations in consulting and prudent expense management. Depreciation in the quarter of $25 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $21 million. This was down $8 million versus the third quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted debt income was 22% for the quarter. The tax rate for the item was used to adjust that income was 35% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.56 up 6% compared with last year. We had 80 million shares outstanding in the third quarter. This is a reduction of close to 1 million shares or about 1% year over year. We exited the third quarter with about 79 million shares on an unweighted basis.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $331 million, up to 5% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $28 million, down 11% year over year as a result of catch up spend on technology investments in 2022, which normalized this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $302 million. Free cash flow is a percent of revenue on a rolling four quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 67% of EBITDA. Adjusted for the after-tax impact of the Q1 divestiture free cash flow conversion from gap net income was 122%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. At the end of the third quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our September 30th debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy, share repurchases, and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.2 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage, and effectively fixed interest rates.  We repurchase $209 million of stock during the third quarter and about $100 million in October. The board increased the authorization by $500 million earlier this week, and we expect they will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. At the end of October, following the increased authorization, we had about $1 billion available for repurchases.  As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. We are raising our full-year guidance to reflect the better than expected Q3 performance and good visibility into the fourth quarter. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Subscription research growth will reflect recent trends in contract value.  We continue to expect stronger growth from the subscription business than the non-subscription part of the segment consistent with the third quarter. For conferences, we still expect Q4 to be the largest quarter of the year. For consulting revenues, the labor business continues to perform well. We have very tough contract optimization comparisons in Q4 and pulled some revenue into Q3 relative to our prior expectations. We will continue both to manage expenses prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins.  Our updated 2023 guidance is as follows. We expect research revenue of at least $4.875 billion, which is FX neutral growth of about 6% or 7%, excluding the Q1 divestiture. The update to the research revenue guides reflects better than planned NCVI performance in Q3 with continued stability in the non-subscription part of the business. There is modest incremental upside relative to the expectations we built into the guidance last quarter. We expect conference revenue of at least $500 million, which is FX neutral growth of about 27%. We have increased our outlook for conferences by $10 million to reflect a good start to the fourth quarter.  We expect consulting revenue of at least $550 million, which is growth of about 8% FX neutral, reflecting the very strong performance of Q3 and timing in the contract optimization business. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of $5.89 billion, which is FX neutral growth of 8%. We now expect full-year EBITDA of at least $1.440 billion, up $80 million from our prior guidance.  With the strong performance in Q3, we have increased confidence in the margin forecast for the fourth quarter. We expect typical operating expense seasonality from Q3 to Q4. We now expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $10.90 per share. For 2023, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.025 billion, up $50 million from our prior guidance. The higher free cash flow reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of 136%, excluding the after-tax divestiture proceeds. Our guidance is based on 80 million fully diluted, weighted-average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of October. We are performing well this year, despite continuing global macro uncertainty and the dynamic tech vender market. CV grew high single-digits in the quarter. Revenue and EBITDA performance exceeded our expectations, and we increased our guidance. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter, and we increased the guidance for the full year. We have repurchased about $550 million in stock year-to-date through October, and remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined, opportunistic, and price-sensitive. Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in about inline with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand to EBITDA margins modestly over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients pay us up front. And we will continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator, and we will be happy to take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jeff Mueller with Baird. Please proceed. Jeff, your line is open. We will certainly continue with the next question. Next question is from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping to ask a question about expenses management, as you look into next year, assuming that tech vendor spending to potentially start to lap with either comparison, there is an opportunity to win back those sales. Do you think you need to invest behind that, or do you think you have an opportunity with your existing salesforce? And then also just your thoughts around expense management as you head into 2024, more broadly?\nGene Hall: It is Gene. So, as we look at our market opportunities, our market opportunity is very fast. Overtime, we intend to grow our salesforce inline with capturing that market opportunity. Over the last couple of years, we have grown our sales force dramatically. And we feel like we're in a really good position as we go into the end of \u201823 and the \u201824 for the capacity we have. Again, over time we'll continue to grow that capacity. \nHeather Balsky: And so just to clarify then, when you think about the tech vendor opportunity, do you think you can win back those sales with the sales force you have that's the fair assumption. \nGene Hall: Yes. Over time, Heather, we think that the tech vendor market will return to the kind of growth we've seen historically. Again, as we -- our perspective on it is a lot of the business they had was pulled forward, their own sales as a result they kind of overhired and have been having some retrenchment, which has in impacted our business. We think -- again, that the tech business is going to grow over time. Their revenues will grow and our business will get back to normal growth over time as well. \nCraig Safian: And Heather, it\u2019s Craig. The other thing I would add is as our tech business, as the contract value growth accelerated over the last two years, we also increased the number of territories we had serving that market. And so, we did a lot of hiring across all of both GTS and GBS as Gene mentioned, over the last couple years, tech vendor market included. And so, a lot of new people joined the company in 2022 in selling positions, and they are coming up the tenure curve. And so, as we think about our territory coverage, if you will, heading into 2024 and beyond, as well as the maturation of our sales force heading into 2024, we feel like we're in a really good position to return to the kind of target growth, that we want to over the medium term. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan. \nToni Kaplan: Thank you. I was hoping you could give us some metrics around the current average tenure of your salespeople, compared to sort of any reference point, maybe it's year-over-year or pre-pandemic or versus a historical average. Just want to get a sense of where we are now versus some historical point. Thanks. \nCraig Safian: Good morning, Toni. Thanks for the question. So, the way to think about it, is if you look at all of the net and gross ads we did in 2022, effectively when we entered this year, we had the least tenured or least experienced salesforce that we've ever had. Sort of order of magnitude. We're typically, and Gene and I have both talked about this in the past like in normal times, call it 35% to 40% of our Salesforce is on the new-ish side. We were in the 50% plus range being brand new to Gartner.  As we've made our way through this year. Obviously, all those people we hired in 2022 have gained experience and tenure. We did -- we were very backend-loaded last year in terms of the hiring. And so those people we hired in third quarter and fourth quarter of last year are now approaching or have just crossed over their one-year anniversary. And again, that's sort of getting back to Heather's question.  Gene, around, do we have enough capacity, et cetera, we have enough capacity and the tenuring will look more quote unquote normal as we roll into 2024, but significantly better than what we experienced or more tenured than we experienced over the course of 2023. \nToni Kaplan: Yes. That makes sense. I wanted to ask about client retention. Sort of a step down in both GTS and GPS, the levels I think are still pretty within historical range, but like, I guess, is there anything you're doing to put in place initiatives to address retention? Or do you feel like you're at sort of more normal levels and I guess what's driving that? And any concern to call out? \nCraig Safian: No. So, on the GTS side, while we're still at or above historical levels, it's really tech vendor drag and it's really small tech vendor drag there. If you actually broke apart our enterprise function leader in GTS, those client retention rates are at or above your historical levels for GTS. And so, it's really just the tech vendor market impacting that client retention rate.  On the GBS side, it's down a little, but it's still 400 basis points or 500 basis points higher than GTS, and so we feel really good about that. That said, we're never done on retention. And so, I'll let Gene talk a little bit about that. \nGene Hall : As Craig said, even with the rates we have now, we are never satisfied. And so, we have a whole set of programs designed to improve those retention rates over time. And it includes things like how we use our conferences, the as the tools, the support tools we give to our service delivery associates as well as the training we have when people first come on board, and then the current trains throughout their careers, et cetera. So, we are never satisfied with the matter no matter how good it is, we always want to be better. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nSeth Weber : Good morning. I wanted to go back to the expense question just for a second. I mean, your margin guidance for this year is pretty well ahead of the initial framework that you guys were talking about earlier in the year or last year. And I'm just trying to think through, are there any big cost buckets that could come back next year? I think, Craig, you mentioned travel is kind of back T&E. So, I'm just trying to think through the margin leverage going forward in higher revenue, in a revenue growth rate environment. If there's anything we should be considering.\nCraig Safian: Good morning, Seth. great question. So, I think, there's a couple things, going on within your question. So, from an operating expense perspective, we are I guess relatively back to sort of normalized level of expenses, there are obviously always going to be puts and takes, but a relatively normalized level of expenses. I would note, and this is obviously embedded in the guidance, that there's a pretty significant step up in OpEx sequentially from Q3 to Q4 just given our conference schedule our travel related to conferences in the fourth quarter, and other client activity marketing related to conferences and Q1 activity, et cetera. So, it reflects sort of a normal Q3 to Q4 step up, but just make sure you kind of bake that into the OpEx.  I think the only thing just to keep in mind is that obviously, our largest revenue line is our research. And there is a lag between when contract value does start accelerating, and when the revenue flows through. And so, we are just very mindful of watching that, and that can have a pretty significant impact on margins, on both a sequential and year-over-year basis.\nSeth Weber : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then it just falling on that, is there any reason to think that pricing would be softer next year than it was in 2023?\nGene Hall: It's Gene. It says what we are seeing in the marketplace is, clients value our products greatly. We expect pricing, the pricing environment will be the same next year as it is this year.\nSeth Weber : Perfect. Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Comes from the line of Jeff -- from Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Jeff? \nUnidentified Analyst: Hello?\nOperator: Your line is open. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Can you hear me now?\nOperator: Yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you. Sorry to drag you back to it. I know you said you have sufficient sales capacity. I just want to make sure I am understanding the management of sales headcount appropriately. So, is this that you have already seen a slowing environment and you have already rebuilt your sales capacity? So, with those dynamics, you are well-calibrated? Or should we be reading into it that there's any sort of, like, incremental weakening you are seeing because we are not seeing that in any of your externally reported metrics?\nGene Hall: Yeah, Jeff. So, you should not read into it in any way that we are seeing any kind of weakening. It is what we talked about earlier, which is that we expanded our salesforce a lot over the last two years. For general GTS, it's up about 18% since the end of 2021, that's a lot of capacity. So, we have added a lot of capacity. On top of that, as Craig mentioned, a lot of those people are now coming into tenure. And so, as we look, especially for '24, we feel like we are really well-situated in terms of actual capacity between the larger number of additions we have made in the last two years and the fact that those people we come up with tenure curve and kind of being at the really, really good spot at the tenure curve during '24. And by the way, the '25 as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then, Craig, you just alluded to this, but, I guess, I was surprised to see subscription revenue performance as well as it did in research. And I am not sure if there is some FX impact or divestiture impact or something. But, to see it on Slide 7 actually accelerate, while CV's still been decelerating, if you can just address why research subscription revenue would be accelerating, with those dynamics.\nCraig Safian: Jeff, I think there is a little bit of FX in there. Obviously, I do think, over the course of Q3, and this is part of the reason why we are able to increase the research guide a little bit too is, NCBI or growth came in earlier in the quarter than we had originally anticipated. And so again, the combination of, it if books in July, we get to take two months of it. If it books at the end of September, it's all in Q4. And so, we got a little bit of that benefit flowing through into Q3. And then, obviously, we are able to raise the full-year guide for the research segment as well because of the beating our expectations for the third quarter in NCBI.\nOperator: Comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please proceed.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to -- again, ask on the headcount question and maybe ask it a different way, which is given where you feel you are with headcount and territory coverage and the ramp for what was previously a lower tenured Salesforce, is it fair for us to expect next year for a bigger gap between CV growth and headcount growth than maybe the 4% to 5% that you've talked about historically as all those dynamics kind of come together? \nCraig Safian: Hey, good morning, Andrew. It's Greg. I think the way we're thinking about it again, we'll provide full guidance in February, but as we've mentioned throughout the course of this year, we are constantly recalibrating based on the external situation and how our business is performing. Looking at the headcount, sort of quarter-to-quarter, there can obviously be a little bit of noise in those numbers. And so, as Gene and I both included too, there's really nothing to see there. And as we roll into next year and beyond the algorithm that we continue to think about is we're going to grow our territories and our headcount in that kind of within four points \u2013 four points to five points of contract value growth. And the four points to five points is really dependent on what we're seeing from a wage inflation perspective.  And so, wage of inflation is abating a little bit, will be closer to CV minus four. If wage inflation is higher, it'll be CV minus five or whatever. But that's the algorithm over the long term or medium term, quarter-to-quarter it may shift a little bit just given what's going on. But over the long term, given the huge addressable market opportunity, that's the algorithm we're going to go after. \nAndrew Nicholas: Makes sense. Thank you. And then for my follow up, I just wanted to ask curious how the last year or so, given all the macro uncertainty, geopolitical dynamics, tech vendor weakness, all these different kinds of noisy items that performance and that growth has remained very strong and within your medium-term target. So, I'm just wondering if, having been through that the past couple years, if you have any kind of updated views on kind of the cyclicality of that business specifically? Because it does seem to have been more resilient than I would've expected, particularly off difficult comps last year. Thank you. \nCraig Safian : Hey, Andrew, sorry, you cut out at the very beginning. Are you talking about consulting? \nAndrew Nicholas: Sorry. No, I was asking about GBS CV growth. Just kind of the resilience of the CV growth there. \nCraig Safian : Yes, I mean, I think it is just consistent with the story, and the facts we've been telling for a while, which is business leaders, outside of IT and HR and finance and legal and sales need help on their mission critical priorities. And we have great products that offer tremendous value in that space. That's really the headline there. We've gotten better at the insights we create. We've gotten better with our selling motions. We've gotten better in everything we do. But the net of it is -- is that business leaders have problems and we have great products to help them solve those problems. And again, we believe that that won't change moving forward. \nOperator: Does that answer your question, Andrew? \nAndrew Nicholas: Yes, thank you. \nOperator: Our next question, please. And it's from the line of Josh Chan with UBS. Please proceed.\nJoshua Chan : You mentioned that NCVI was better this quarter than you expected. So, is there any themes in terms of types of clients to call out and do you think that the strength is more a function of the market turning or is it your Salesforce gaining traction there? \nGene Hall: Yeah, I guess, Josh, I'd say that we saw a pretty consistent market environment between Q2 and Q3. If we get -- a minute ago, which is that our experts look at what are the most important issues facing executives in each of their functional areas? And we have we give them advice on how to address those things that's done in all kinds of environments, whether it's a really robust environment or not as robust for that individual enterprise. And so, I think we see as just that clients give a lot of value out of our research and it's been true over time. \nJoshua Chan : Thank you for that Gene, and I guess on the consulting side, I appreciate that you mentioned there was some timing pull forward there. But do you think the contract optimization string is more a function of where we are in the cycle and clients looking to, I guess, optimize their spend? Or is that more of a kind of a one-time type of event for you? Do you expect kind of sustained strength in the contract optimization business for the next couple of quarters, I guess? \nGene Hall: Yeah, the contract optimization business we've talked about in the past is a very lumpy business. And so, you can't really take one quarter and sort of say, and extrapolate is something different in the market, whatever. It's really just a matter of when deals happen to come in and what clients have to be looking for that point in time. And so, the only way you really look at that business is kind of like over a year-long period or something from quarter to quarter. You can't really draw any conclusions. I do think, Josh, one other thing I'd add is that clients like saving money in any operating environment. So, again, I think, it's obviously a really strong value proposition even in a not choppy economic environment. \nOperator: And it's from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed.\nManav Patnaik : Thank you. Good morning. Craig, just to ask the expense question a little differently. I mean, obviously, the seasonal tick-up going into 4Q, but if you look at the full year thus far, like has that expense base been more normal or are there any other puts and takes we need to consider as we go into next year? \nCraig Safian : Yes. Good morning, Manav. I think it is -- I would characterize it as roughly normal. I do think that as we pivot into next year we are likely to get back to a little bit faster headcount and territory growth. And so, we need to model that in. But that's probably the biggest lever on that operating expense base. Other than the timing of conferences and things like that. It is just -- as Jean mentioned earlier, we grew a lot, particularly in 2022. And so, this year we have been, we are sort of operationalizing maturing, and digesting a lot of that growth.  And so there has not been a huge amount of net headcount growth baked into the 2023 numbers. There is some, but not, as much as we have had historically. I think we get back to a more normal level of that next year. So that would have to be modeled in our normal wage inflation and merit increase, and things like that. But the other stuff is generally normal course.\nManav Patnaik : Got it. Okay. And then my second question just around the new sales environment. Obviously, fourth quarter is the big quarter. Any color on that plus, just I think the new sales numbers you gave for GTS and GBS were positive mid to high single-digits. Like, how much of that was comps versus and just talk about the momentum there, I guess.\nGene Hall: So, in terms of the selling environment, again, I think it is unchanged. We see the same selling grind sort of Q2, Q3, and we are expecting the same environment in Q4 in terms of comp outlook. Craig?\nCraig Safian: Correct. And, I mean, I think you are referring to the headcount numbers. And so, I mean, GBS headcount was up 10% year-over-year. GTS up 4.5%. Again, we are constantly, as we have talked about, you are probably tired of hearing me say recalibrating those numbers around a variety of different scenarios for the end of the year. Obviously, there is only another two months left in the year. But we expect to end the year, sort of aligned from an account perspective and CV perspective. So that we roll into next year with the right size salesforce. And then we will continue to grow that salesforce moving forward to go after that huge market opportunity.\nManav Patnaik : Apologies, Craig. I was referring to the new business number, but I appreciate the headcount color as well.\nCraig Safian: Okay. Great. Sorry about that. So, on the new business side, I think it is a combination of a little bit easier comps, and the maturation of the sales force, coming up tenure curve.\nManav Patnaik : Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: One moment for the next question, please. And it comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Going back to tech vendor trends, you mentioned that, research non-subscription revenues were similar in terms of performance to 2Q, and tech vendor CV growth was in the low single-digits. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what you are seeing with tech vendors? And if you are updated 2023 guide, assumes stabilization or improvement in performance.\nGene Hall: So, I would say for Q3, we didn't see any change in the tech vendor environment, just the same as we have seen in Q2. In terms of the guidance, I will let Craig talk.\nCraig Safian: I mean, I think it's stabilization, George. So, we haven't yet seen signs that market has shifted yet. We do believe, again, over the medium-term or the next year, year-and-a-half that, we will get back to more normal growth trends there, but, I would say, what we saw in Q3 and what's embedded in the guidance. And again, I mean, the reality just also remember that, contract value or growth we sell in Q4 really has almost a de minimis impact on the full-year research revenue numbers from a subscription revenue perspective. And so, stabilization baked in there and similarly on the non-sub line we have not assumed any crazy rebound, sort of what we're seeing is stabilization, and that's what we've modeled into the guidance. \nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then perhaps to ask the margin question a little bit differently, you've raised your full-year guidance for EBITDA margins, once again this quarter, can you provide your latest views on what structural EBITDA margins are, and if the factors that led to your improved full-year outlook for EBITDA margins can also lead to an improved view on structural margins? \nCraig Safian: Sure. Happy to. So, I think, the view is really not changed from prior quarters and prior discussions. So, what I'd say is, our view on our margin profile today is that the base or foundational margins are in the low 20s. Obviously, that is significantly higher than they were before the pandemic and before the CEB acquisition. In addition to that, as always, we believe there is operating leverage in the business and that our margins will go higher over time. We'll give guidance in February as we always do. We talked about on some of the other OpEx questions, this year's operating expense as a reasonable starting point to think about the margins and the overall P&L for next year.  But just obviously keep in mind that there are other things beyond just the OpEx level and the level of investment we put into the business next year that will impact. The margins most notably where we end this year from a contract value perspective, because as we've talked about, there is a lag in terms of the revenue and the CV relationship, both when CV decelerating, but also when CV begins to accelerate as well. So, it does take a quarter or two for a lag for the sub-revenue to kind of catch up with the CV. And so again, just be mindful of that as you think about 2024 as well. We'll provide all those details in February when we come out with our initial guidance for 2024. \nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Jeffrey Silber with BMO Capital Markets. \nJeffrey Silber: Thank you, so much. I'm not going to ask a margin question. Actually, wanted to talk about pricing. If I remember correctly, this is the time of year when you start instituting price increases, and I'm just wondering how that been? If you've seen any pushback in terms of client may be pushing back on what they're buying. Thanks. \nGene Hall : Alright, Jeff, I'll get started. Which is -- as I mentioned earlier, we haven't seen any, it is the time we increased prices. It rolls through obviously as clients renew. And I'd say it's a normal environment. We haven't seen any pushback. \nCraig Safian : Yes, I mean, Jeff, so the major price increase for us goes in went into place two days ago on November 1st. So, we're obviously very, very, very early in that cycle. But again, if you think about it, the average client is spending order of magnitude $250,000 or $260,000 a year with us. So, the difference between 4% and 5% is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. And again, we're very focused on making sure that we're delivering value well in excess of that $250,000 or $260,000. So, we're generally able to sell the price increase, again, sort of as a normal course of business for us. \nJeffrey Silber: Okay. That\u2019s helpful, appreciate. Let me shift over to conferences. I know the numbers have been strong. But typically, when we're in an environment of economic uncertainty, that area of the business might tend to be a little bit weaker. Do you think we're just seeing kind of a bounce back from the pandemic and the fact that nobody was traveling and nobody was mingling, and maybe as we go into next year, you might see some softness in that business? \nGene Hall: So, Jeff, I think the key thing driving the business is that our clients, our enterprise functional leaders have a lot of challenges. And we've done a good job at laying out what those challenges are and how they should address them. As we market our conferences to potential attendees, we focus on here are the issues we face, and here's how we're going to help you with that. You can come to the conference. And so, I think, the biggest single thing that's driving our conference performance is that we're on the issues people care.  Our attendees have a lot of issues and we are on the, our experts have a lot of solutions to those issues that they get a lot of value from. I think that's kind of the biggest thing. In addition to that, obviously, we've been adding conferences back and so we're getting, I think some people that couldn't go to conferences in the past now can go. And so, you sort of see that in terms of comparison points, but it's really how you do more about the value. I think most of all. \nJeffrey Silber: Okay. Thanks, so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A session. I would like to turn the call over to Eugene Hall for his closing comments. \nGene Hall: Well, here's what I'd like you to take away for today's call. Gartner drove another strong performance in Q3. We deliver unparalleled value to enterprise leaders in their teams across every major function with a thriving, struggling, or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment.  Looking ahead, we're well-positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time. We generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. Even as we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital, to our shareholders. This reduce the shares outstanding and increases for returns over time. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: And thank you all for participating and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Third quarter results were strong with high single-digit growth in contract value. Revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow were better-than-expected with outstanding performance in consulting and disciplined cost management. With strong results in the quarter and good visibility into Q4, we are increasing our 2023 guidance. Third quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, up 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, compared to 69% in the prior year, as the 2022 hiring catch-up continue to flow through the P&L as expected. EBITDA was $333 million ahead of our guidance and about inline with last year. Adjusted EPS was $2.56, up 6% from Q3 of last year. And free cash flow was $302 million. We have finished the quarter with 20,253 associates, up 6% from the prior year and 1% from the end of the second quarter. We remain well-positioned from a talent perspective, as our associates continue to move up the tenure curve. Research revenue in the third quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 5% on an FX neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an organic FX neutral basis. Non-subscription revenue performance was similar to Q2. Third quarter research contribution was 73%, compared to 74% in the prior year period, as we have caught up on hiring and returned to the new expected levels of travel. Contract value or CV was $4.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 8% versus the prior year. The third quarter last year was a very strong research quarter with outstanding performance across most key metrics. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes the first quarter 2023 divestiture. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS, grew at double-digit rates. New business with enterprise function leaders increased double-digits as well. CV from tech vendors grew low single-digits, compared to mid-teens growth in the third quarter of 2022. Quarterly net contract value increase or NCVI was $101 million. As we have discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes, and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of the industry sectors grew at double-digit rates, led by the transportation, services, and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories other than the small category, which has the largest tech vendor mix, and grew low single-digits. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our Top 10 countries. Global Technology sales contract value was $3.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $65 million from the second quarter. Wallet retention for GTS was 102% for the quarter, which compares to 107% in the prior year, when we saw a near record high for this metric.  IT Enterprise function leaders while retention remained above historical GTS levels during the third quarter. GTS new business was up 7% versus last year. New business with IT enterprise function leaders increased mid-teens compared to the prior year. GTS quota bearing headcount was up 5% year-over-year. With the dynamic territory planning we introduced a few years ago. The catch up hiring we did last year and our teams moving up the 10-year curve we're well-positioned for growth moving into 2024.  Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earning supplement. Global business sales contract value was $1 billion at the end of the third quarter up 14% year-over-year. All of our GBS practices grew a double-digit or high single-digit rates other than sales, which grew mid-single digits. Growth was again led by supply chain and HR. GBS CV increased $36 million from the second quarter, while retention for GBS was 108% for the quarter, which compares to 114% in the prior year when we saw one of the highest ever results for this metric. GBS new business was up 10% compared to last year. GBS quota bearing headcount was up 10% year-over-year. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earning supplement. Conferences revenue for the third quarter was $57 million ahead of our expectations during a seasonally small period, we delivered strong growth for the conferences we held in Q3 compared to the same conferences in 2022.  The calendar shifted significantly from 2022 to 2023 with the return to in-person. Contribution margin in the quarter was 36% consistent with typical seasonality and reflecting investments for future growth. We held nine destination conferences in the quarter, all in person. Third quarter consulting revenues increased by 24% year-over-year to $133 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 23%. Consulting contribution margin was 37% in the third quarter. Labor-based revenues were $100 million up 10% versus Q3 of last year, as reported and on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at June 30th was $180 million, increasing 15% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with continued booking straight. Our contract optimization business is highly valuable.  We delivered $33 million of revenue in the quarter with some of the revenue pulled forward from the fourth quarter relative to our prior outlook. Consolidated cost of services increased 8% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and 7% on an FX neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher head counts to support our future growth. SG&A increased 8% year-over-year in the third quarters reported and 7% on an FX neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth.  EBITDA for the third quarter was $333 million, about in line with last year. Third quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance primarily reflected revenue exceeding our expectations in consulting and prudent expense management. Depreciation in the quarter of $25 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $21 million. This was down $8 million versus the third quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted debt income was 22% for the quarter. The tax rate for the item was used to adjust that income was 35% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.56 up 6% compared with last year. We had 80 million shares outstanding in the third quarter. This is a reduction of close to 1 million shares or about 1% year over year. We exited the third quarter with about 79 million shares on an unweighted basis.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $331 million, up to 5% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $28 million, down 11% year over year as a result of catch up spend on technology investments in 2022, which normalized this year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $302 million. Free cash flow is a percent of revenue on a rolling four quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 67% of EBITDA. Adjusted for the after-tax impact of the Q1 divestiture free cash flow conversion from gap net income was 122%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. At the end of the third quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our September 30th debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy, share repurchases, and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.2 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage, and effectively fixed interest rates.  We repurchase $209 million of stock during the third quarter and about $100 million in October. The board increased the authorization by $500 million earlier this week, and we expect they will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. At the end of October, following the increased authorization, we had about $1 billion available for repurchases.  As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. We are raising our full-year guidance to reflect the better than expected Q3 performance and good visibility into the fourth quarter. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Subscription research growth will reflect recent trends in contract value.  We continue to expect stronger growth from the subscription business than the non-subscription part of the segment consistent with the third quarter. For conferences, we still expect Q4 to be the largest quarter of the year. For consulting revenues, the labor business continues to perform well. We have very tough contract optimization comparisons in Q4 and pulled some revenue into Q3 relative to our prior expectations. We will continue both to manage expenses prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins.  Our updated 2023 guidance is as follows. We expect research revenue of at least $4.875 billion, which is FX neutral growth of about 6% or 7%, excluding the Q1 divestiture. The update to the research revenue guides reflects better than planned NCVI performance in Q3 with continued stability in the non-subscription part of the business. There is modest incremental upside relative to the expectations we built into the guidance last quarter. We expect conference revenue of at least $500 million, which is FX neutral growth of about 27%. We have increased our outlook for conferences by $10 million to reflect a good start to the fourth quarter.  We expect consulting revenue of at least $550 million, which is growth of about 8% FX neutral, reflecting the very strong performance of Q3 and timing in the contract optimization business. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of $5.89 billion, which is FX neutral growth of 8%. We now expect full-year EBITDA of at least $1.440 billion, up $80 million from our prior guidance.  With the strong performance in Q3, we have increased confidence in the margin forecast for the fourth quarter. We expect typical operating expense seasonality from Q3 to Q4. We now expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $10.90 per share. For 2023, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.025 billion, up $50 million from our prior guidance. The higher free cash flow reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of 136%, excluding the after-tax divestiture proceeds. Our guidance is based on 80 million fully diluted, weighted-average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of October. We are performing well this year, despite continuing global macro uncertainty and the dynamic tech vender market. CV grew high single-digits in the quarter. Revenue and EBITDA performance exceeded our expectations, and we increased our guidance. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter, and we increased the guidance for the full year. We have repurchased about $550 million in stock year-to-date through October, and remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined, opportunistic, and price-sensitive. Looking out over the medium-term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in about inline with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand to EBITDA margins modestly over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients pay us up front. And we will continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I will turn the call back over to the operator, and we will be happy to take your questions. Operator? And Heather, it's Craig. The other thing I would add is as our tech business, as the contract value growth accelerated over the last two years, we also increased the number of territories we had serving that market. And so, we did a lot of hiring across all of both GTS and GBS as Gene mentioned, over the last couple years, tech vendor market included. And so, a lot of new people joined the company in 2022 in selling positions, and they are coming up the tenure curve. And so, as we think about our territory coverage, if you will, heading into 2024 and beyond, as well as the maturation of our sales force heading into 2024, we feel like we're in a really good position to return to the kind of target growth, that we want to over the medium term. Good morning, Toni. Thanks for the question. So, the way to think about it, is if you look at all of the net and gross ads we did in 2022, effectively when we entered this year, we had the least tenured or least experienced salesforce that we've ever had. Sort of order of magnitude. We're typically, and Gene and I have both talked about this in the past like in normal times, call it 35% to 40% of our Salesforce is on the new-ish side. We were in the 50% plus range being brand new to Gartner.  As we've made our way through this year. Obviously, all those people we hired in 2022 have gained experience and tenure. We did -- we were very backend-loaded last year in terms of the hiring. And so those people we hired in third quarter and fourth quarter of last year are now approaching or have just crossed over their one-year anniversary. And again, that's sort of getting back to Heather's question.  Gene, around, do we have enough capacity, et cetera, we have enough capacity and the tenuring will look more quote unquote normal as we roll into 2024, but significantly better than what we experienced or more tenured than we experienced over the course of 2023. No. So, on the GTS side, while we're still at or above historical levels, it's really tech vendor drag and it's really small tech vendor drag there. If you actually broke apart our enterprise function leader in GTS, those client retention rates are at or above your historical levels for GTS. And so, it's really just the tech vendor market impacting that client retention rate.  On the GBS side, it's down a little, but it's still 400 basis points or 500 basis points higher than GTS, and so we feel really good about that. That said, we're never done on retention. And so, I'll let Gene talk a little bit about that. Good morning, Seth. great question. So, I think, there's a couple things, going on within your question. So, from an operating expense perspective, we are I guess relatively back to sort of normalized level of expenses, there are obviously always going to be puts and takes, but a relatively normalized level of expenses. I would note, and this is obviously embedded in the guidance, that there's a pretty significant step up in OpEx sequentially from Q3 to Q4 just given our conference schedule our travel related to conferences in the fourth quarter, and other client activity marketing related to conferences and Q1 activity, et cetera. So, it reflects sort of a normal Q3 to Q4 step up, but just make sure you kind of bake that into the OpEx.  I think the only thing just to keep in mind is that obviously, our largest revenue line is our research. And there is a lag between when contract value does start accelerating, and when the revenue flows through. And so, we are just very mindful of watching that, and that can have a pretty significant impact on margins, on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Jeff, I think there is a little bit of FX in there. Obviously, I do think, over the course of Q3, and this is part of the reason why we are able to increase the research guide a little bit too is, NCBI or growth came in earlier in the quarter than we had originally anticipated. And so again, the combination of, it if books in July, we get to take two months of it. If it books at the end of September, it's all in Q4. And so, we got a little bit of that benefit flowing through into Q3. And then, obviously, we are able to raise the full-year guide for the research segment as well because of the beating our expectations for the third quarter in NCBI. Hey, good morning, Andrew. It's Greg. I think the way we're thinking about it again, we'll provide full guidance in February, but as we've mentioned throughout the course of this year, we are constantly recalibrating based on the external situation and how our business is performing. Looking at the headcount, sort of quarter-to-quarter, there can obviously be a little bit of noise in those numbers. And so, as Gene and I both included too, there's really nothing to see there. And as we roll into next year and beyond the algorithm that we continue to think about is we're going to grow our territories and our headcount in that kind of within four points \u2013 four points to five points of contract value growth. And the four points to five points is really dependent on what we're seeing from a wage inflation perspective.  And so, wage of inflation is abating a little bit, will be closer to CV minus four. If wage inflation is higher, it'll be CV minus five or whatever. But that's the algorithm over the long term or medium term, quarter-to-quarter it may shift a little bit just given what's going on. But over the long term, given the huge addressable market opportunity, that's the algorithm we're going to go after. Hey, Andrew, sorry, you cut out at the very beginning. Are you talking about consulting? Yes, I mean, I think it is just consistent with the story, and the facts we've been telling for a while, which is business leaders, outside of IT and HR and finance and legal and sales need help on their mission critical priorities. And we have great products that offer tremendous value in that space. That's really the headline there. We've gotten better at the insights we create. We've gotten better with our selling motions. We've gotten better in everything we do. But the net of it is -- is that business leaders have problems and we have great products to help them solve those problems. And again, we believe that that won't change moving forward. Yes. Good morning, Manav. I think it is -- I would characterize it as roughly normal. I do think that as we pivot into next year we are likely to get back to a little bit faster headcount and territory growth. And so, we need to model that in. But that's probably the biggest lever on that operating expense base. Other than the timing of conferences and things like that. It is just -- as Jean mentioned earlier, we grew a lot, particularly in 2022. And so, this year we have been, we are sort of operationalizing maturing, and digesting a lot of that growth.  And so there has not been a huge amount of net headcount growth baked into the 2023 numbers. There is some, but not, as much as we have had historically. I think we get back to a more normal level of that next year. So that would have to be modeled in our normal wage inflation and merit increase, and things like that. But the other stuff is generally normal course. Correct. And, I mean, I think you are referring to the headcount numbers. And so, I mean, GBS headcount was up 10% year-over-year. GTS up 4.5%. Again, we are constantly, as we have talked about, you are probably tired of hearing me say recalibrating those numbers around a variety of different scenarios for the end of the year. Obviously, there is only another two months left in the year. But we expect to end the year, sort of aligned from an account perspective and CV perspective. So that we roll into next year with the right size salesforce. And then we will continue to grow that salesforce moving forward to go after that huge market opportunity. Okay. Great. Sorry about that. So, on the new business side, I think it is a combination of a little bit easier comps, and the maturation of the sales force, coming up tenure curve. I mean, I think it's stabilization, George. So, we haven't yet seen signs that market has shifted yet. We do believe, again, over the medium-term or the next year, year-and-a-half that, we will get back to more normal growth trends there, but, I would say, what we saw in Q3 and what's embedded in the guidance. And again, I mean, the reality just also remember that, contract value or growth we sell in Q4 really has almost a de minimis impact on the full-year research revenue numbers from a subscription revenue perspective. And so, stabilization baked in there and similarly on the non-sub line we have not assumed any crazy rebound, sort of what we're seeing is stabilization, and that's what we've modeled into the guidance. Sure. Happy to. So, I think, the view is really not changed from prior quarters and prior discussions. So, what I'd say is, our view on our margin profile today is that the base or foundational margins are in the low 20s. Obviously, that is significantly higher than they were before the pandemic and before the CEB acquisition. In addition to that, as always, we believe there is operating leverage in the business and that our margins will go higher over time. We'll give guidance in February as we always do. We talked about on some of the other OpEx questions, this year's operating expense as a reasonable starting point to think about the margins and the overall P&L for next year.  But just obviously keep in mind that there are other things beyond just the OpEx level and the level of investment we put into the business next year that will impact. The margins most notably where we end this year from a contract value perspective, because as we've talked about, there is a lag in terms of the revenue and the CV relationship, both when CV decelerating, but also when CV begins to accelerate as well. So, it does take a quarter or two for a lag for the sub-revenue to kind of catch up with the CV. And so again, just be mindful of that as you think about 2024 as well. We'll provide all those details in February when we come out with our initial guidance for 2024. Yes, I mean, Jeff, so the major price increase for us goes in went into place two days ago on November 1st. So, we're obviously very, very, very early in that cycle. But again, if you think about it, the average client is spending order of magnitude $250,000 or $260,000 a year with us. So, the difference between 4% and 5% is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. And again, we're very focused on making sure that we're delivering value well in excess of that $250,000 or $260,000. So, we're generally able to sell the price increase, again, sort of as a normal course of business for us."

            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove another strong performance in Q3. We delivered high signal digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA, and adjusted EPS came in above expectations. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent. The external environment remains volatile and uncertain. The tech sector is still adjusting to post pandemic demand. The banking industry continues to grapple with rising interest rates. Supply chain challenges are still impacting many industries. There's heightened geopolitical volatility and more. Leaders know they need help and they know Gartner is the best source for that help.  Gartner delivers actionable objective insight that smarter decisions and stronger performance on our client's mission critical priorities. Whether they're thriving, struggling, or anywhere in between. Our insights, tools and advice often mean the difference between success and failure for leaders and the enterprises they serve. We continue to be agile and adapt to the changing environment. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. We guide leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast, across all sectors, sizes and geographies.  We estimate our opportunity at around $200 billion. In the third quarter, we continue to help clients with a wide range of topics such as cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization, and more. In the third quarter, research revenue grew 5%. Subscription revenue grew 8% on an organic basis, 20 contract value growth was 8%. Contract value for enterprise function leaders continue to grow at double digit rates.  We serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels, global technology sales, or GTS source leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also source leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs, Chief Marketing Officers, and Senior Product Leaders. GTS contract valued grew 7%. GTS sales to enterprise function leaders performed well in the quarter. GTS sales to leaders at technology vendors were affected by technology sector dynamics and tough year over year comparisons.  We expect sales to technology vendors will return to normal growth rates over the next 12 months to 18 months. Global business sales or GBS serve leaders in their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 14%. Through a relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. Our business remains resilient despite a persistent, complicated external environment and tough compares for the technology vendor market.  Gartner conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. This will be the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019. We're having a great year. In-person attendance and advanced bookings are at record levels. The fourth quarter is off to a great start and our outlook for the year remains strong.  IT Symposium Expo is our flagship conference series. I recently attended this conference in Orlando. Attendance was strong. Our sales teams were highly engaged with clients and prospects, and feedback from the conference continues to be excellent. Gartner consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project-based work.  Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 23% in the third quarter with record results and contract optimization. Given the strong performances across our business, we've increased our 2023 guidance for revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Greg will take you through the details.  We're well positioned to have strong close to the year and get off to a fast start in 2024. In closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver unparalleled value to enterprise leaders and their teams across every major function, whether they're thriving, struggling, or anywhere in between. We're essentially agile and continuously adapt to the changing world. We know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to continue our strong record of success far into the future.  Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term, sustained, double-digit revenue growth. We would fit margins will expand modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. Even as we invest for future growth, we will return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns overtime. With that, I will hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. It is Gene. So, as we look at our market opportunities, our market opportunity is very fast. Overtime, we intend to grow our salesforce inline with capturing that market opportunity. Over the last couple of years, we have grown our sales force dramatically. And we feel like we're in a really good position as we go into the end of \u201823 and the \u201824 for the capacity we have. Again, over time we'll continue to grow that capacity. Yes. Over time, Heather, we think that the tech vendor market will return to the kind of growth we've seen historically. Again, as we -- our perspective on it is a lot of the business they had was pulled forward, their own sales as a result they kind of overhired and have been having some retrenchment, which has in impacted our business. We think -- again, that the tech business is going to grow over time. Their revenues will grow and our business will get back to normal growth over time as well. As Craig said, even with the rates we have now, we are never satisfied. And so, we have a whole set of programs designed to improve those retention rates over time. And it includes things like how we use our conferences, the as the tools, the support tools we give to our service delivery associates as well as the training we have when people first come on board, and then the current trains throughout their careers, et cetera. So, we are never satisfied with the matter no matter how good it is, we always want to be better. It's Gene. It says what we are seeing in the marketplace is, clients value our products greatly. We expect pricing, the pricing environment will be the same next year as it is this year. Yeah, Jeff. So, you should not read into it in any way that we are seeing any kind of weakening. It is what we talked about earlier, which is that we expanded our salesforce a lot over the last two years. For general GTS, it's up about 18% since the end of 2021, that's a lot of capacity. So, we have added a lot of capacity. On top of that, as Craig mentioned, a lot of those people are now coming into tenure. And so, as we look, especially for '24, we feel like we are really well-situated in terms of actual capacity between the larger number of additions we have made in the last two years and the fact that those people we come up with tenure curve and kind of being at the really, really good spot at the tenure curve during '24. And by the way, the '25 as well. Yeah, I guess, Josh, I'd say that we saw a pretty consistent market environment between Q2 and Q3. If we get -- a minute ago, which is that our experts look at what are the most important issues facing executives in each of their functional areas? And we have we give them advice on how to address those things that's done in all kinds of environments, whether it's a really robust environment or not as robust for that individual enterprise. And so, I think we see as just that clients give a lot of value out of our research and it's been true over time. Yeah, the contract optimization business we've talked about in the past is a very lumpy business. And so, you can't really take one quarter and sort of say, and extrapolate is something different in the market, whatever. It's really just a matter of when deals happen to come in and what clients have to be looking for that point in time. And so, the only way you really look at that business is kind of like over a year-long period or something from quarter to quarter. You can't really draw any conclusions. I do think, Josh, one other thing I'd add is that clients like saving money in any operating environment. So, again, I think, it's obviously a really strong value proposition even in a not choppy economic environment. So, in terms of the selling environment, again, I think it is unchanged. We see the same selling grind sort of Q2, Q3, and we are expecting the same environment in Q4 in terms of comp outlook. Craig? So, I would say for Q3, we didn't see any change in the tech vendor environment, just the same as we have seen in Q2. In terms of the guidance, I will let Craig talk. Alright, Jeff, I'll get started. Which is -- as I mentioned earlier, we haven't seen any, it is the time we increased prices. It rolls through obviously as clients renew. And I'd say it's a normal environment. We haven't seen any pushback. So, Jeff, I think the key thing driving the business is that our clients, our enterprise functional leaders have a lot of challenges. And we've done a good job at laying out what those challenges are and how they should address them. As we market our conferences to potential attendees, we focus on here are the issues we face, and here's how we're going to help you with that. You can come to the conference. And so, I think, the biggest single thing that's driving our conference performance is that we're on the issues people care.  Our attendees have a lot of issues and we are on the, our experts have a lot of solutions to those issues that they get a lot of value from. I think that's kind of the biggest thing. In addition to that, obviously, we've been adding conferences back and so we're getting, I think some people that couldn't go to conferences in the past now can go. And so, you sort of see that in terms of comparison points, but it's really how you do more about the value. I think most of all. Well, here's what I'd like you to take away for today's call. Gartner drove another strong performance in Q3. We deliver unparalleled value to enterprise leaders in their teams across every major function with a thriving, struggling, or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment.  Looking ahead, we're well-positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time. We generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. Even as we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital, to our shareholders. This reduce the shares outstanding and increases for returns over time. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nGene Hall: Good morning. And thanks for joining us today. Garner drove another strong performance in Q2. We delivered double-digit revenue growth and high-single digit growth in contract value. EBITDA. EBITDA margins, and adjusted EPS came in above expectations as a result of modest revenue upside and disciplined cost management. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent.  The environment remains highly uncertain. The tech sector continues to adjust to post pandemic demand. The banking industry is grappling with rising interest rates. Many industries continue to be impacted by supply chain challenges and more.  Enterprise leaders and their teams need actionable, objective insight. Gartner is the best source for the insight, tools and advice that make the difference between success and failure for these leaders and the enterprises they serve.  We're helping our clients make better decisions, whether they're thriving or struggling or anywhere in between. We do this through consistent execution of operational best practices.  Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. We guide leaders across all major enterprise functions. Our market opportunity is fast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. We estimate our opportunity at around $200 billion. 95% of our addressable market is with enterprise functional leaders like chief information officers, CFOs, heads of supply chain and more. The balance of the market opportunity is with technology vendors.  In the second quarter, we helped clients with a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization and more.  Research revenue grew 7% in Q2. Subscription revenue grew 9% on an organic basis. Total contract value growth was 9%. Contract value for enterprise function leaders continued to grow at double-digit rates.  We serve executives and our teams through distinct sales channels. Global technology sales or GTS stores leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders and technology vendors, including CEOs, chief marketing officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 7%.  GTS sales to enterprise function leaders performed well in the quarter. GTS sales to leaders and technology vendors were affected by technology sector dynamics and tough year-over-year comparisons. We expect sales to technology vendors will return to our target growth rates over the medium term.  Global business sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 15%.  Through relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. Our business remains resilient, despite a persistent complicated external environments and tough compares for the technology vendor market.  Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. This will be the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019, and we're off to a great start. Attendance is strong.

Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 6% in the second quarter.  We updated our 2023 guidance, increasing EBITDA and free cash flow. We've revised our non-subscription research revenue to reflect technology vendor dynamics, and our outlook for conferences is higher. Craig will take you through the details.  In closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth.

With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. \nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene. And good morning. Second quarter results were strong, with high-single digit growth in contract value and double-digit FX neutral revenue growth. EBITDA, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS were better than expected as a result of modest revenue upside and disciplined cost management.  Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent. With good visibility into the balance of the year, we are increasing our 2023 EBITDA and free cash flow guidance.  Second quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 9% year-over-year as reported and 10% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68% compared to 69% in the prior year as we caught up on hiring during 2022.  EBITDA was $384 million, ahead of our guidance and about in line with last year. Adjusted EPS was $2.85, consistent with Q2 of last year. And free cash flow was $410 million.  We finished the quarter with 20,104 associates, up 12% from the prior year and 1% from the end of the first quarter. We remain well positioned from a talent perspective, with low levels of open territories and our new associates coming up the tenure curve. We will continue to carefully calibrate headcount and operating expenses based on near term revenue growth and opportunities to invest for the future.  Research revenue in the second quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 7% on a FX neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 9% on an organic FX neutral basis. Second quarter Research contribution margin was 73% compared to 74% in the prior-year period, as we have caught up on hiring and return to the new expected levels of travel.  Contract value, or CV, was $4.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 9% versus the prior year. The second quarter last year was one of our strongest research quarters ever, with outstanding performance on nearly every metric we provide. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes the first quarter of 2023 divestiture.  CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. CV from tech vendors grew low-single digits compared to mid-teens growth in the second quarter of 2022. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCBI, was $41 million. As we've discussed in the past, there's notable seasonality in this metric.  CV growth was broad based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of industry sectors grew at double-digit rates, again led by the transportation, retail and public sectors. We had high-single digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories other than the small category, which grew mid-single digits. This category has the largest tech vendor mix.  We also drove double-digit or high-single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global technology sales contract value was $3.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. GPS had quarterly NCBI of $14 million. Wallet retention for GTS was 102% for the quarter, which compares to 107% in the prior year when we saw a record high for this metric. IT enterprise function leaders wallet retention remained above historical GTS levels during the second quarter.  GTS new business was down 4% versus last year. New business with IT enterprise function leaders increased high-single digits compared to the prior year against the tough compare.  GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 13% year-over-year, reflecting the catch-up hiring we did in 2022. We will continue to manage hiring based on both short term performance and the medium term opportunity.  A regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.  Global business sales contract value was $1 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 15% year-over-year, which remains towards the higher end of our medium term outlook of 12% to 16%. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit or high-single digit rates, again led by supply chain and HR. GBS CV increased $27 million from the first quarter.  Wallet retention for GBS was 109% for the quarter as compared to 115% in the prior year when we saw one of the highest ever results for this metric. GBS new business was up 2% compared to last year against the strong compare.  GBS quota-bearing headcount was up 15% year-over-year. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.  Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $169 million, ahead of our expectations as we saw strong performance with both exhibitors and attendees. Contribution margin in the quarter was 58%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held 17 destination conferences in the quarter, all in person.  Second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 5% year-over-year to $126 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 6%. Consulting contribution margin was 37% in the second quarter. Labor-based revenues were $104 million, up 9% versus Q2 of last year and up 11% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at June 30 was $172 million, increasing 17% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with continued booking strength.  Our contract optimization business is highly variable. We delivered $22 million of revenue in the quarter and the pipeline for both contract optimization and labor-based revenues remained strong.  Consolidated cost of services increased 15% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and on an FX neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth. We also saw an increase in cost year-over-year with the return to in-person conferences.  SG&A increased 12% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 14% on an FX mutual basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth. EBITDA for the second quarter was $384 million compared to $389 million in the year-ago period. Second quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our expectations in conferences and prudent expense management.  Depreciation in the quarter of $24 million was up modestly compared to 2022.  Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $23 million. This was down $5 million versus the second quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity.  The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 27% for the quarter.  Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $2.85, in line with last year. We had 80 million shares outstanding in the second quarter. This is a reduction of close to 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the second quarter with about 80 million shares on an unweighted basis.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $436 million, up 5% compared to last year.  CapEx for the quarter was $26 million, up 21% year-over-year as a result of an increase in technology investments.  Free cash flow for the quarter was $410 million. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue on a rolling four quarter basis was 17% of revenue and 66% of EBITDA. Adjusted for the after tax impact of the Q1 divestiture, free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 119%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating.  At the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our June 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2 times. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong, with $2.2 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates.  We repurchased $132 million of stock during the second quarter. We had about $830 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization at June 30. We expect the board to continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward.  As we continue to repurchase shares our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time.  We are increasing our full year Conferences EBITDA and free cash flow guidance to reflect the strong Q2 performance. We are updating our Research revenue guidance to reflect tech vendor market dynamics on the non-subscription part of the business. For Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects.  We've got tough compares across most of the segment for another quarter. We expect stronger growth from subscription business and the non-subscription part of the segment as we indicated last quarter. The non-subscription part of the business has direct exposure to tech vendor spending.  The outlook continues to be based on all of our 47 destination conferences for 2023 running in-person. There is seasonality to the business based on the conference's calendar, which is different than the historical pattern. We still expect Q4 to be the largest quarter of the year. We expect Q3 will be the smallest revenue quarter of the year as I noted in May.  For Consulting revenues, contract optimization remains highly variable. We had a very strong year in 2022, especially in contract optimization in the fourth quarter. We will continue both to manage expenses prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins.  Our updated 2023 guidance is as follows. We expect Research revenue of at least $4.855 billion, which is FX neutral growth of about 6%, or 7% excluding the Q1 divestiture. The update to Research revenue guidance reflects the effect of tech vendor market dynamics on the non-subscription part of the business.  We expect Conferences revenue of at least $490 million, which is growth of about 26%. We've increased our outlook for Conferences by $20 million.  We expect Consulting revenue of at least $505 million, which is growth of about 5% FX neutral, consistent with the outlook we gave in May. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.85 billion, which is FX neutral growth of 7%. The guidance reflects an update to non-subscription Research revenue, partially offset by an increase to Conferences.  We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.36 billion, up $30 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. We will deliver on our margin guidance in most economic scenarios. If revenue is stronger than our outlook, EBITDA would be better than our guidance.  We now expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $10. For 2023, we now expect free cash flow of at least $975 million, up $55 million from our prior guidance. This higher free cash flow reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of about 140% excluding the after tax divestiture proceeds. Our guidance is based on 80 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of June.  Finally, for the third quarter of 2023, we expect EBITDA of at least $275 million. We had a strong first half despite continuing global macro uncertainty in a dynamic tech vendor market. TV and revenue grew high-single digits in the quarter.  Conferences and EBITDA performance exceeded our expectations, and we increased our guidance as well. Margins are strong, consistent with our prior commentary. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter and we increased the guidance for the full year.  We repurchased over $230 million in stock during the first half and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And we have ample liquidity that we are ready to deploy on behalf of shareholders over the coming quarters.  Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time, and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us up front. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck-in M&A.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question coming from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.\nJeffrey Meuler: Q2 CV and new business sold seemed solid meet, but just want to make sure and 100% confirm that there was no change to Research subscription revenue expectations in the guidance that's signaling, like surprising step down recently or incremental slowing recently in CV. And if it's all limited to just the non-subs, the $70 million reduction on a $422 million revenue base seems like a big mid-year adjustment if you can just talk through the dynamics there.\nCraig Safian: On the first part of your question, the subscription revenue piece of our business continues to perform very well. As you noted, we do have the tech vendor dynamics impacting the business, but GBS continues to be very strong. The IT and user portion of GBS continues very, very strong. Your point on the CV growth for each of those and the new business dynamics for each of those were spot on in the quarter. And so, essentially, the revision to guidance, where we thought we were going to be from a subscription perspective, it's the non-sub piece that really impacted the guidance. I think \u2013 and Gene will hop in here too \u2013 the way to think about the impact, so clearly, as we talked about, the non-sub business has direct exposure to tech vendor marketing spending, and that has become very constrained over the last few quarters and more constrained in the first half of this year. And that's essentially what's impacting that business.  We do believe that when the tech vendor market stabilizes, that this will get back to being a great growth business for us, just like it will within the GBS subscription part of the business as well. We're just dealing with a little bit of those temporary dynamics that we're talking about. And again, having two quarters of history to be able then to look forward, with the facts we saw in the first half of the year, that led to that revision, but again solely on the non-subscription part of the business.\nJeffrey Meuler: When I hear about tech vendor marketing spend weakness, obviously, we see that in the broader landscape. So what's happening in your non-subs business in Research directionally make sense, but the thing that I would worry about is does Conferences revenue also get hit again or get hit at some point? And I get that the Conferences attendance is strong, but it seems surprising to me that the exhibitor bookings are doing as well as they are in Conferences against that landscape. And maybe if you could compare and contrast, like, if there's a major client difference or if it's just the value prop is so strong or if how you think about, I guess, future risk on exhibitor bookings in Conferences. \nGene Hall: Our conferences business is a great business of great value proposition. It's doing extremely well. On the attendee side, we're seeing great growth across the board. We're expanding the number of conferences as quickly as we can do it operationally because we're seeing such great take-up.  On the exhibitor side, similarly, because we have such great attendees, it's very attractive to exhibitors. And our exhibitor bookings have been very strong and in line with what we've seen last year, which are also extremely strong. And it's because of the great value proposition we have with both our attendees and with the exhibitors.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky: You just kind of talked about your enterprise business and how it's holding up strong. And you talked about it running up double-digits this quarter. I'm just curious, quarter to quarter, I guess 2Q versus 1Q, how that business is trending, where you see demand going in the current environment? And potentially what you think some of the catalysts are in either direction?\nCraig Safian: I think the trends on the enterprise function leader part of the business were pretty consistent from Q1 to Q2, so nothing within the quarter and really nothing too much from a variability perspective from Q1 to Q2. So those businesses continue to perform very well. And our expectation is they continue to perform very well. So, nothing really to see there from a monthly perspective or from quarter to quarter perspective.\nHeather Balsky: With regard to your outlook for the tech vendors, you talked about that you see it returning to sort of your normalized run rate growth over the midterm. And then I think you just mentioned that it's probably more of a short term trend. I'm just curious, kind of are you seeing any signs of potential improvement as you move through the year or even through 2024? Or just curious why you're talking more over the midterm versus the short term. \nGene Hall: What I say is, on a short term basis, no change Q1 to Q2 in terms of tech vendor demand, very similar, with the exception of the non-subscription business, which is we've talked about. It's our perspective that what happened with Gartner, tech industry is that demand got pulled forward during the pandemic. So, there was some demand that was already filled in. And demand will get back to trend once sort of a little time elapses. And how long that takes, we don't know. But we believe that technology business will get back to trend in the medium term.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: I was hoping that you could talk about the current client spending appetite, if you're seeing cost cutting or if you're seeing just business as usual. It sounds like the subscription business is performing well and it's just this tech vendor piece that's having a little bit of a hiccup. So just wanted to get any color on the overall customer environment.\nGene Hall: As you pointed out, contract value for enterprise function leaders continue to grow at double digit rates. I will say while we're growing there, that more decisions are getting escalated and there's more scrutiny than there was your like a year ago. So it's a tougher environment in terms of work relations. But at the end of the day, people see our value and vibe, which is why we had that great performance.\nToni Kaplan: I wanted to ask about whether AI could actually be a help for you with regard to adding additional seats across the enterprise. Are you thinking that corporations will start to need an AI strategy across some of the GBS lines like finance, legal, HR? Could that lead to additional seats? And then similarly, within GTS, could that lead to additional seats as well? Or do you view this as being sort of similar to prior technology trends like cloud, and so therefore, it's just a change of topic.\nGene Hall: I expected it's little bit in between, actually, that it is a change of topics. But there's more kind of intense interest in the topic of AI than there was in such a short period with cloud. [indiscernible] of it, we did more than 22,000 interactions in the first half. This is a one-on-one calls with our experts on the subject of AI, which is higher than any other single topic and the rate of growth is very high. We're seeing a lot of demand with enterprises that we hadn't seen before where they're saying, hey, could you please come in and talk to us about AI? So we expect that that will be a positive for our business. \nCraig Safian: The only thing I'd add is just underscore your point on the broad applicability of AI being a little bit different than some other topics because, to your point, finance leaders care about it, legal leaders care about it, HR leaders care about it, in addition to IT leaders and their teams caring about it. So there is the potential that is a little more broad based to your point than prior technology lens.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo.\nSeth Weber: I wanted to ask just about the implied EBITDA margin raise for the year. Is that just a function of mix? Or is there something else that's supporting the stronger margin outlook for the year?\nCraig Safian: On the margins, as we've talked about, the margins can pop around a little bit from quarter to quarter, depending on spending trends and where the revenue is trending as well. And so, our margins were a little bit higher than we had initially anticipated in the first half of the year.  And I'd say it's really just a combination of revenue modestly exceeding our expectations in the first half and expenses modestly being a little bit below our expectations. Or said another way, we're just more prudently managing our OpEx as we work our way through the year.  So, again, margins can pop around. There's no mega trends there, I would say, other than a little bit of modest revenue upside and us making sure that \u2013 again, we talked about, in our prepared remarks, really carefully calibrating our headcount levels and our OpEx levels to ensure that we deliver consistently strong margins.\nSeth Weber: Just on the big ramp in the quota-bearing headcount, can you just talk to where you think you are from an efficiency perspective for the new hires? Are they kind of on track or any kind of metrics that you could call out as far as efficiency or productivity goes with the new hires? \nGene Hall: To your point, we've ramped up our sales force with the lowest number of opens we've had in a long time. And the talent that we're hiring, if you look at kind of how we track the quality of the talent, is very, very high. And we ramped up hiring the most last year. So these people are starting to get a little bit of tenure under their belt. And we expect over the next three years, as they get up to full tenure, that actually the productivity will be very good. And we're seeing the ramp we'd expect at this point.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Just on the margin front, Craig, I think on the call, you mentioned T&Es back to normal or something of that effect. So I was just curious, are we at those normalized levels where you're talking about kind of the long term margin being in the low 20s? Or is there more normalization to occur still overall with all the different moving pieces?\nCraig Safian: We are back to what we believe to be roughly the new normal from both T&E perspective. And last year, in particular, we were playing catch-up on hiring throughout the course of the year. And so, as you look at our operating expenses now, I think we're at pretty \"normal level\" of operating expenses. And so, what we're looking at from Q2 through the end of this year is normal seasonality from an OpEx perspective with our new normal levels of T&E minus headcount growth and make sure that we're investing for the future, et cetera, kind of baked in. So I think it is a good, normalized, if you will, OpEx level that we're working off of this year. \nManav Patnaik: Just on the second half, a little bit more specifically, can you just talk about, I suppose, the hiring expectations. It may be even just on the cost side, it seems a little conservative, but maybe there's some things we're missing here.\nCraig Safian: Yeah, I think there's a few things in there. One is the seasonality with our Conferences business. We are performing really, really well in Conferences. And Q4 is by far our largest Conference quarter. And that means you generally see expenses up in the fourth quarter just to deliver those conferences. And then because it's the fourth quarter, because we have so many conferences, there's a lot of additional travel and marketing activity that spikes in the fourth quarter as well, which, again, is sort of back to our typical seasonality that we had from an OpEx perspective pre-pandemic.  So if you think about OpEx, it's relatively flattish from 2Q to Q3. A little bit of step down because it's a lighter conferences quarter and then a pretty big step up in OpEx from Q3 to Q4, driven by the conferences calendar, significant travel to support our conferences calendar, and marketing to support the conferences calendar and the close of our year as well.  We are running a number of scenarios and we are planning in a very agile way in terms of the headcount that we plan to add between now and the end of this year. And there's a wide range of scenarios. And we've got a wide range of recruiting scenarios as well.  One of the things that we've been very careful about is making sure that we maintain our recruitment capacity, so that when supercharged growth returns, we are more than ready to turn that dial from a recruitment perspective. So we're maintaining our recruitment capacity, and we're ready to tune those dials up or down, depending on what the second half of the year looks like, predominantly from a contract value growth perspective. \nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Josh Chan with UBS.\nJoshua Chan: I guess on GTS, obviously, the wallet retention is impacted by the overall environment. I was just wondering what you think the trajectory of the GTS wallet retention will be over the coming quarters? Would it surprise you if it went below 100% or is that too drastic of a scenario?\nCraig Safian: I think important to disaggregate the enterprise function leader portion of GTS and the tech vendor portion of GTS. So, overall, we are still well over 100% on wallet retention, and that's with the enterprise function portion of our GTS wallet retention being above historical averages. And so, we expect that to continue.  The tech vendor side, wallet retention is a rolling four quarter metric. And so, we'll have these more challenging quarters in the number for a little while. But I would say we don't forecast wallet retention. I shouldn't say we don't forecast it, we don't guide wallet retention or contract value. But given that the enterprise function leader part of the GTS business is the predominant part of it, call it 70-ish percent of the business, that continues to be very strong, and that should drive the wallet retention over the coming quarters.\nJoshua Chan: On your comments about headcount, I guess, what indicators are you looking for in order to kind of toggle up or toggle down the recruitment in the second half? \nGene Hall: The main thing we look at is what our CV growth is. So, we look at what our bookings are and how sales are going because we want to make sure we match our headcount growth to the amount of bookings that we have, and that kind of helps ensure that our focus of business going forward in the right space from both a growth viewpoint as well as margin viewpoint.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line pf Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.\nStephanie Moore: I wanted to touch on the Research pricing environment. I believe you tend to increase those in the fall of the year. So just wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about price increases for this year into next?\nCraig Safian: I think one of our core goals with pricing is to make sure that, at a minimum, we are offsetting our projected wage inflation. And so, the past few years, when we were seeing higher wage inflation, we went a little bit stronger on price increase.  This year, again, the labor market, for the type of people that we are recruiting is still relatively strong. But the wage inflation we expect to be a little bit more muted. We're still working through all the details of the price increase, which, again, to your point, goes into effect in November. But I would suspect it's a little bit lighter than what we've done the last few years, just given the inflationary environment, particularly wage inflationary environment, had abated a little bit.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: Following up on some of the tech vendor non-subscription trends, can you talk about which products specifically are seeing reduced demand due to a slowdown in tech vendor marketing spend? And generally, is the non-subscription demand leading coincident or lagging with broader client IT spend? \nCraig Safian: Just want to clarify your question. So it was which products are most impacted? Is that what the question was?\nGeorge Tong: Yeah, within your non-subscription book of products?\nCraig Safian: Within the non-subscription part of the business, which, again, represents around 8% \u2013 or less than 10% of, let's call it, of our overall research revenue, the predominant way we derive revenue there is through lead generation for tech vendors and really focus on the, I call it, non-enterprise IT market. So, smaller businesses, et cetera.  And so, our GTS business is really focused on enterprise tech companies, whereas the non-subscription business is really focused on a combination of enterprise and really small business focused technology companies. And so, that's where we've seen, on the small technology companies, the companies most focused on selling into small businesses, that's where we've seen the biggest challenge.  Again, you've covered all the things that are happening in the tech market from funding and the overall dynamics there. But as those companies are recalibrating their operating expenses, clearly, marketing and lead gen is a place that they often look to get a big handle on. And I think that's what's happening.  That said, they are still spending and spending well in that business. And as Gene mentioned earlier, and I think I mentioned too, we fully expect, once the market is recalibrated, it will get back to growing, but it's predominantly around the lead gen stuff and the focus on lead gen in smaller businesses.\nGeorge Tong: Separately, can you talk about how the tech vendor non-subscription performance trended over the course of the quarter? Did you see a bottoming? Did you see further deterioration as you move through the quarter? And does your updated guide assume trends stabilize from 2Q levels or worsen from two key levels?\nCraig Safian: I think it's been relatively consistent with normal levels of volatility week to week and actually even day to day, but trends pretty consistent Q1 to Q2. And what we've modeled into our guide is essentially stabilization from those Q2 levels for the balance of the year. \nOperator:\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeffrey Silber: I'm sorry to keep on focusing on the non-subscriptions piece. Normally, can you just tell us from a breakdown perspective, what percentage comes from tech vendors and what percentage comes from enterprise customers? And if we could just focus in on the enterprise customers component of that, can you talk about how that's trending?\nCraig Safian: 100% of the revenue comes from tech vendors in the non-subscription part of the business. So, 100% of that less than 10% of our overall Research business is tech vendor focused. \nJeffrey Silber: I wanted to actually circle back and talk about AI, but the potential impact on your business internally. Do you think it's going to make your analysts more efficient? Do you think you might be able to reduce headcount from an analyst perspective just to take advantage of technology? Any thoughts would be great.\nGene Hall: We're looking at AI from a lot of perspectives. The first and most important one is what I talked about earlier, which is there's a tremendous amount of client demand, and we're the best source for clients to get help in AI. And it's of a tremendous interest with them. So that's the key place that we are most focused on.  We actually use AI in our business today. We have for years in different parts of our business. And so, internally, we look at are there cost optimization opportunities we use internally? As I said, we've been doing that. We're increasing the amount of that over time. We're also looking at, can we support provide customer services [indiscernible] enhanced, all those kinds of things.  I'd say, internally, those kinds of uses are going to be normal course of business. We always focus on improved productivity. We have a lot of tools. Technology is a big part of the toolkit. And AI is just one of those tools improving productivity over time, which we've always been focused on.  And so, I don't see any kind of, like, some costs dropping by 50% or something because [indiscernible] part of our ongoing continuous improvement and continuous innovation that we've been doing for years.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. At this time, I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Gene Hall for any closing remarks.\nGene Hall: So here's what I'd like you to take away from today's call. Gartner drove another strong performance in Q2. We deliver unparalleled value to enterprise leaders and their teams across every major function, whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world. We know the right things to do to be successful in any environment.  Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term, sustained, double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income.  Even as we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time.  Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene. And good morning. Second quarter results were strong, with high-single digit growth in contract value and double-digit FX neutral revenue growth. EBITDA, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS were better than expected as a result of modest revenue upside and disciplined cost management.  Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent. With good visibility into the balance of the year, we are increasing our 2023 EBITDA and free cash flow guidance.  Second quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 9% year-over-year as reported and 10% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68% compared to 69% in the prior year as we caught up on hiring during 2022.  EBITDA was $384 million, ahead of our guidance and about in line with last year. Adjusted EPS was $2.85, consistent with Q2 of last year. And free cash flow was $410 million.  We finished the quarter with 20,104 associates, up 12% from the prior year and 1% from the end of the first quarter. We remain well positioned from a talent perspective, with low levels of open territories and our new associates coming up the tenure curve. We will continue to carefully calibrate headcount and operating expenses based on near term revenue growth and opportunities to invest for the future.  Research revenue in the second quarter grew 6% year-over-year as reported and 7% on a FX neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 9% on an organic FX neutral basis. Second quarter Research contribution margin was 73% compared to 74% in the prior-year period, as we have caught up on hiring and return to the new expected levels of travel.  Contract value, or CV, was $4.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 9% versus the prior year. The second quarter last year was one of our strongest research quarters ever, with outstanding performance on nearly every metric we provide. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes the first quarter of 2023 divestiture.  CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. CV from tech vendors grew low-single digits compared to mid-teens growth in the second quarter of 2022. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCBI, was $41 million. As we've discussed in the past, there's notable seasonality in this metric.  CV growth was broad based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of industry sectors grew at double-digit rates, again led by the transportation, retail and public sectors. We had high-single digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories other than the small category, which grew mid-single digits. This category has the largest tech vendor mix.  We also drove double-digit or high-single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global technology sales contract value was $3.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% versus the prior year. GPS had quarterly NCBI of $14 million. Wallet retention for GTS was 102% for the quarter, which compares to 107% in the prior year when we saw a record high for this metric. IT enterprise function leaders wallet retention remained above historical GTS levels during the second quarter.  GTS new business was down 4% versus last year. New business with IT enterprise function leaders increased high-single digits compared to the prior year against the tough compare.  GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 13% year-over-year, reflecting the catch-up hiring we did in 2022. We will continue to manage hiring based on both short term performance and the medium term opportunity.  A regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.  Global business sales contract value was $1 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 15% year-over-year, which remains towards the higher end of our medium term outlook of 12% to 16%. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit or high-single digit rates, again led by supply chain and HR. GBS CV increased $27 million from the first quarter.  Wallet retention for GBS was 109% for the quarter as compared to 115% in the prior year when we saw one of the highest ever results for this metric. GBS new business was up 2% compared to last year against the strong compare.  GBS quota-bearing headcount was up 15% year-over-year. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement.  Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $169 million, ahead of our expectations as we saw strong performance with both exhibitors and attendees. Contribution margin in the quarter was 58%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held 17 destination conferences in the quarter, all in person.  Second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 5% year-over-year to $126 million. On an FX neutral basis, revenues were up 6%. Consulting contribution margin was 37% in the second quarter. Labor-based revenues were $104 million, up 9% versus Q2 of last year and up 11% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at June 30 was $172 million, increasing 17% year-over-year on an FX neutral basis with continued booking strength.  Our contract optimization business is highly variable. We delivered $22 million of revenue in the quarter and the pipeline for both contract optimization and labor-based revenues remained strong.  Consolidated cost of services increased 15% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and on an FX neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth. We also saw an increase in cost year-over-year with the return to in-person conferences.  SG&A increased 12% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 14% on an FX mutual basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth. EBITDA for the second quarter was $384 million compared to $389 million in the year-ago period. Second quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our expectations in conferences and prudent expense management.  Depreciation in the quarter of $24 million was up modestly compared to 2022.  Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $23 million. This was down $5 million versus the second quarter of 2022 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity.  The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 27% for the quarter.  Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $2.85, in line with last year. We had 80 million shares outstanding in the second quarter. This is a reduction of close to 1 million shares or about 1% year-over-year. We exited the second quarter with about 80 million shares on an unweighted basis.  Operating cash flow for the quarter was $436 million, up 5% compared to last year.  CapEx for the quarter was $26 million, up 21% year-over-year as a result of an increase in technology investments.  Free cash flow for the quarter was $410 million. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue on a rolling four quarter basis was 17% of revenue and 66% of EBITDA. Adjusted for the after tax impact of the Q1 divestiture, free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 119%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating.  At the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our June 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2 times. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong, with $2.2 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates.  We repurchased $132 million of stock during the second quarter. We had about $830 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization at June 30. We expect the board to continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward.  As we continue to repurchase shares our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time.  We are increasing our full year Conferences EBITDA and free cash flow guidance to reflect the strong Q2 performance. We are updating our Research revenue guidance to reflect tech vendor market dynamics on the non-subscription part of the business. For Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects.  We've got tough compares across most of the segment for another quarter. We expect stronger growth from subscription business and the non-subscription part of the segment as we indicated last quarter. The non-subscription part of the business has direct exposure to tech vendor spending.  The outlook continues to be based on all of our 47 destination conferences for 2023 running in-person. There is seasonality to the business based on the conference's calendar, which is different than the historical pattern. We still expect Q4 to be the largest quarter of the year. We expect Q3 will be the smallest revenue quarter of the year as I noted in May.  For Consulting revenues, contract optimization remains highly variable. We had a very strong year in 2022, especially in contract optimization in the fourth quarter. We will continue both to manage expenses prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins.  Our updated 2023 guidance is as follows. We expect Research revenue of at least $4.855 billion, which is FX neutral growth of about 6%, or 7% excluding the Q1 divestiture. The update to Research revenue guidance reflects the effect of tech vendor market dynamics on the non-subscription part of the business.  We expect Conferences revenue of at least $490 million, which is growth of about 26%. We've increased our outlook for Conferences by $20 million.  We expect Consulting revenue of at least $505 million, which is growth of about 5% FX neutral, consistent with the outlook we gave in May. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.85 billion, which is FX neutral growth of 7%. The guidance reflects an update to non-subscription Research revenue, partially offset by an increase to Conferences.  We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.36 billion, up $30 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. We will deliver on our margin guidance in most economic scenarios. If revenue is stronger than our outlook, EBITDA would be better than our guidance.  We now expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $10. For 2023, we now expect free cash flow of at least $975 million, up $55 million from our prior guidance. This higher free cash flow reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of about 140% excluding the after tax divestiture proceeds. Our guidance is based on 80 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of June.  Finally, for the third quarter of 2023, we expect EBITDA of at least $275 million. We had a strong first half despite continuing global macro uncertainty in a dynamic tech vendor market. TV and revenue grew high-single digits in the quarter.  Conferences and EBITDA performance exceeded our expectations, and we increased our guidance as well. Margins are strong, consistent with our prior commentary. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter and we increased the guidance for the full year.  We repurchased over $230 million in stock during the first half and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And we have ample liquidity that we are ready to deploy on behalf of shareholders over the coming quarters.  Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time, and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us up front. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value enhancing tuck-in M&A.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? On the first part of your question, the subscription revenue piece of our business continues to perform very well. As you noted, we do have the tech vendor dynamics impacting the business, but GBS continues to be very strong. The IT and user portion of GBS continues very, very strong. Your point on the CV growth for each of those and the new business dynamics for each of those were spot on in the quarter. And so, essentially, the revision to guidance, where we thought we were going to be from a subscription perspective, it's the non-sub piece that really impacted the guidance. I think \u2013 and Gene will hop in here too \u2013 the way to think about the impact, so clearly, as we talked about, the non-sub business has direct exposure to tech vendor marketing spending, and that has become very constrained over the last few quarters and more constrained in the first half of this year. And that's essentially what's impacting that business.  We do believe that when the tech vendor market stabilizes, that this will get back to being a great growth business for us, just like it will within the GBS subscription part of the business as well. We're just dealing with a little bit of those temporary dynamics that we're talking about. And again, having two quarters of history to be able then to look forward, with the facts we saw in the first half of the year, that led to that revision, but again solely on the non-subscription part of the business. I think the trends on the enterprise function leader part of the business were pretty consistent from Q1 to Q2, so nothing within the quarter and really nothing too much from a variability perspective from Q1 to Q2. So those businesses continue to perform very well. And our expectation is they continue to perform very well. So, nothing really to see there from a monthly perspective or from quarter to quarter perspective. The only thing I'd add is just underscore your point on the broad applicability of AI being a little bit different than some other topics because, to your point, finance leaders care about it, legal leaders care about it, HR leaders care about it, in addition to IT leaders and their teams caring about it. So there is the potential that is a little more broad based to your point than prior technology lens. On the margins, as we've talked about, the margins can pop around a little bit from quarter to quarter, depending on spending trends and where the revenue is trending as well. And so, our margins were a little bit higher than we had initially anticipated in the first half of the year.  And I'd say it's really just a combination of revenue modestly exceeding our expectations in the first half and expenses modestly being a little bit below our expectations. Or said another way, we're just more prudently managing our OpEx as we work our way through the year.  So, again, margins can pop around. There's no mega trends there, I would say, other than a little bit of modest revenue upside and us making sure that \u2013 again, we talked about, in our prepared remarks, really carefully calibrating our headcount levels and our OpEx levels to ensure that we deliver consistently strong margins. We are back to what we believe to be roughly the new normal from both T&E perspective. And last year, in particular, we were playing catch-up on hiring throughout the course of the year. And so, as you look at our operating expenses now, I think we're at pretty \"normal level\" of operating expenses. And so, what we're looking at from Q2 through the end of this year is normal seasonality from an OpEx perspective with our new normal levels of T&E minus headcount growth and make sure that we're investing for the future, et cetera, kind of baked in. So I think it is a good, normalized, if you will, OpEx level that we're working off of this year. Yeah, I think there's a few things in there. One is the seasonality with our Conferences business. We are performing really, really well in Conferences. And Q4 is by far our largest Conference quarter. And that means you generally see expenses up in the fourth quarter just to deliver those conferences. And then because it's the fourth quarter, because we have so many conferences, there's a lot of additional travel and marketing activity that spikes in the fourth quarter as well, which, again, is sort of back to our typical seasonality that we had from an OpEx perspective pre-pandemic.  So if you think about OpEx, it's relatively flattish from 2Q to Q3. A little bit of step down because it's a lighter conferences quarter and then a pretty big step up in OpEx from Q3 to Q4, driven by the conferences calendar, significant travel to support our conferences calendar, and marketing to support the conferences calendar and the close of our year as well.  We are running a number of scenarios and we are planning in a very agile way in terms of the headcount that we plan to add between now and the end of this year. And there's a wide range of scenarios. And we've got a wide range of recruiting scenarios as well.  One of the things that we've been very careful about is making sure that we maintain our recruitment capacity, so that when supercharged growth returns, we are more than ready to turn that dial from a recruitment perspective. So we're maintaining our recruitment capacity, and we're ready to tune those dials up or down, depending on what the second half of the year looks like, predominantly from a contract value growth perspective. I think important to disaggregate the enterprise function leader portion of GTS and the tech vendor portion of GTS. So, overall, we are still well over 100% on wallet retention, and that's with the enterprise function portion of our GTS wallet retention being above historical averages. And so, we expect that to continue.  The tech vendor side, wallet retention is a rolling four quarter metric. And so, we'll have these more challenging quarters in the number for a little while. But I would say we don't forecast wallet retention. I shouldn't say we don't forecast it, we don't guide wallet retention or contract value. But given that the enterprise function leader part of the GTS business is the predominant part of it, call it 70-ish percent of the business, that continues to be very strong, and that should drive the wallet retention over the coming quarters. I think one of our core goals with pricing is to make sure that, at a minimum, we are offsetting our projected wage inflation. And so, the past few years, when we were seeing higher wage inflation, we went a little bit stronger on price increase.  This year, again, the labor market, for the type of people that we are recruiting is still relatively strong. But the wage inflation we expect to be a little bit more muted. We're still working through all the details of the price increase, which, again, to your point, goes into effect in November. But I would suspect it's a little bit lighter than what we've done the last few years, just given the inflationary environment, particularly wage inflationary environment, had abated a little bit. Just want to clarify your question. So it was which products are most impacted? Is that what the question was? Within the non-subscription part of the business, which, again, represents around 8% \u2013 or less than 10% of, let's call it, of our overall research revenue, the predominant way we derive revenue there is through lead generation for tech vendors and really focus on the, I call it, non-enterprise IT market. So, smaller businesses, et cetera.  And so, our GTS business is really focused on enterprise tech companies, whereas the non-subscription business is really focused on a combination of enterprise and really small business focused technology companies. And so, that's where we've seen, on the small technology companies, the companies most focused on selling into small businesses, that's where we've seen the biggest challenge.  Again, you've covered all the things that are happening in the tech market from funding and the overall dynamics there. But as those companies are recalibrating their operating expenses, clearly, marketing and lead gen is a place that they often look to get a big handle on. And I think that's what's happening.  That said, they are still spending and spending well in that business. And as Gene mentioned earlier, and I think I mentioned too, we fully expect, once the market is recalibrated, it will get back to growing, but it's predominantly around the lead gen stuff and the focus on lead gen in smaller businesses. I think it's been relatively consistent with normal levels of volatility week to week and actually even day to day, but trends pretty consistent Q1 to Q2. And what we've modeled into our guide is essentially stabilization from those Q2 levels for the balance of the year. 100% of the revenue comes from tech vendors in the non-subscription part of the business. So, 100% of that less than 10% of our overall Research business is tech vendor focused."

            "content": "Good morning. And thanks for joining us today. Garner drove another strong performance in Q2. We delivered double-digit revenue growth and high-single digit growth in contract value. EBITDA. EBITDA margins, and adjusted EPS came in above expectations as a result of modest revenue upside and disciplined cost management. Free cash flow in the quarter was excellent.  The environment remains highly uncertain. The tech sector continues to adjust to post pandemic demand. The banking industry is grappling with rising interest rates. Many industries continue to be impacted by supply chain challenges and more.  Enterprise leaders and their teams need actionable, objective insight. Gartner is the best source for the insight, tools and advice that make the difference between success and failure for these leaders and the enterprises they serve.  We're helping our clients make better decisions, whether they're thriving or struggling or anywhere in between. We do this through consistent execution of operational best practices.  Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. We guide leaders across all major enterprise functions. Our market opportunity is fast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. We estimate our opportunity at around $200 billion. 95% of our addressable market is with enterprise functional leaders like chief information officers, CFOs, heads of supply chain and more. The balance of the market opportunity is with technology vendors.  In the second quarter, we helped clients with a wide range of topics, including cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization and more.  Research revenue grew 7% in Q2. Subscription revenue grew 9% on an organic basis. Total contract value growth was 9%. Contract value for enterprise function leaders continued to grow at double-digit rates.  We serve executives and our teams through distinct sales channels. Global technology sales or GTS stores leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders and technology vendors, including CEOs, chief marketing officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 7%.  GTS sales to enterprise function leaders performed well in the quarter. GTS sales to leaders and technology vendors were affected by technology sector dynamics and tough year-over-year comparisons. We expect sales to technology vendors will return to our target growth rates over the medium term.  Global business sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 15%.  Through relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. Our business remains resilient, despite a persistent complicated external environments and tough compares for the technology vendor market.  Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. This will be the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019, and we're off to a great start. Attendance is strong. Exhibitor bookings are at record levels, and feedback continues to be excellent. We had a great first half and the outlook for the year is strong.  Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 6% in the second quarter.  We updated our 2023 guidance, increasing EBITDA and free cash flow. We've revised our non-subscription research revenue to reflect technology vendor dynamics, and our outlook for conferences is higher. Craig will take you through the details.  In closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver unparalleled value to enterprise leaders and their teams across every major function, whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world. We know the right things to do to be successful in any environment.  Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long term, sustained, double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income.  Even as we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time.  With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Our conferences business is a great business of great value proposition. It's doing extremely well. On the attendee side, we're seeing great growth across the board. We're expanding the number of conferences as quickly as we can do it operationally because we're seeing such great take-up.  On the exhibitor side, similarly, because we have such great attendees, it's very attractive to exhibitors. And our exhibitor bookings have been very strong and in line with what we've seen last year, which are also extremely strong. And it's because of the great value proposition we have with both our attendees and with the exhibitors. What I say is, on a short term basis, no change Q1 to Q2 in terms of tech vendor demand, very similar, with the exception of the non-subscription business, which is we've talked about. It's our perspective that what happened with Gartner, tech industry is that demand got pulled forward during the pandemic. So, there was some demand that was already filled in. And demand will get back to trend once sort of a little time elapses. And how long that takes, we don't know. But we believe that technology business will get back to trend in the medium term. As you pointed out, contract value for enterprise function leaders continue to grow at double digit rates. I will say while we're growing there, that more decisions are getting escalated and there's more scrutiny than there was your like a year ago. So it's a tougher environment in terms of work relations. But at the end of the day, people see our value and vibe, which is why we had that great performance. I expected it's little bit in between, actually, that it is a change of topics. But there's more kind of intense interest in the topic of AI than there was in such a short period with cloud. [indiscernible] of it, we did more than 22,000 interactions in the first half. This is a one-on-one calls with our experts on the subject of AI, which is higher than any other single topic and the rate of growth is very high. We're seeing a lot of demand with enterprises that we hadn't seen before where they're saying, hey, could you please come in and talk to us about AI? So we expect that that will be a positive for our business. To your point, we've ramped up our sales force with the lowest number of opens we've had in a long time. And the talent that we're hiring, if you look at kind of how we track the quality of the talent, is very, very high. And we ramped up hiring the most last year. So these people are starting to get a little bit of tenure under their belt. And we expect over the next three years, as they get up to full tenure, that actually the productivity will be very good. And we're seeing the ramp we'd expect at this point. The main thing we look at is what our CV growth is. So, we look at what our bookings are and how sales are going because we want to make sure we match our headcount growth to the amount of bookings that we have, and that kind of helps ensure that our focus of business going forward in the right space from both a growth viewpoint as well as margin viewpoint. We're looking at AI from a lot of perspectives. The first and most important one is what I talked about earlier, which is there's a tremendous amount of client demand, and we're the best source for clients to get help in AI. And it's of a tremendous interest with them. So that's the key place that we are most focused on.  We actually use AI in our business today. We have for years in different parts of our business. And so, internally, we look at are there cost optimization opportunities we use internally? As I said, we've been doing that. We're increasing the amount of that over time. We're also looking at, can we support provide customer services [indiscernible] enhanced, all those kinds of things.  I'd say, internally, those kinds of uses are going to be normal course of business. We always focus on improved productivity. We have a lot of tools. Technology is a big part of the toolkit. And AI is just one of those tools improving productivity over time, which we've always been focused on.  And so, I don't see any kind of, like, some costs dropping by 50% or something because [indiscernible] part of our ongoing continuous improvement and continuous innovation that we've been doing for years. So here's what I'd like you to take away from today's call. Gartner drove another strong performance in Q2. We deliver unparalleled value to enterprise leaders and their teams across every major function, whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world. We know the right things to do to be successful in any environment.  Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term, sustained, double-digit revenue growth. We expect margins will expand modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income.  Even as we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. This reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time.  Thanks for joining us today and we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

First quarter results were strong with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. FX-neutral growth was even stronger than our reported results. We also again delivered better-than-planned EBITDA margins. The upside reflected stronger Conferences and Consulting revenue and disciplined cost management. With results ahead of our expectations, we are increasing our 2023 guidance. First quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, up 12% year-over-year as reported and 14% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, down 103 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $379 million, up 15% year-over-year and up 19% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.88 up 24%. And free cash flow in the quarter was $144 million. We finished the quarter with 19,830 associates, up 15% from the prior year and 2% from the end of the fourth quarter. We are well positioned from a talent perspective with low levels of open territories and our new associates coming up the ten-year curve. And we will continue to carefully calibrate headcount and operating expenses based on near-term revenue growth and opportunities to invest for the future. Research revenue in the first quarter grew 7% year-over-year as reported and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 11%, FX neutral. First quarter research contribution margin was 74%, down about one point as we have caught up on hiring and return to the new expected levels of travel. Contract value or CV was $4.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. The first quarter last year was one of our strongest research quarters ever with outstanding performance on nearly every metric we provide. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes both Russia and the recent divestiture. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. CV from tech vendors grew mid-single digits compared to high teens growth in the first quarter of 2022. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $26 million. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, all industry sectors grew at double-digit rates other than technology and media, which both grew at mid-single-digit rates. The fastest growth was in the transportation, retail and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in all of our top ten countries. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 9% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $10 million. While retention for GTS was 104% for the quarter, which compares to 107% in the prior year when we saw a record high for this metric. While tech vendor wallet retention remained under pressure, on a net basis, our clients spend more with us compared to the prior year. GTS new business was down 1% versus last year. New business with IT function leaders increased compared to the prior year against the tough compare. New business with tech vendors declined versus very strong performance last year. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 22% year-over-year and 11% on a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. We will continue to manage hiring based on both short-term performance and the medium-term opportunity. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $983 million at the end of the first quarter, up 16% year-over-year, which is at the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. All of our GBS practices other than sales and marketing grew at double-digit rates. Supply chain and HR both continued to grow faster than 20%. GBS CV increased $16 million from the fourth quarter. While retention for GBS was 110% for the quarter, which compares to 115% in the prior year when we saw the highest end result for this metric. In addition to continued strong client retention, our clients spent significantly more with us than they did a year ago. GBS new business was down 4% compared to last year against a very strong compare. The two-year compound annual growth rate for new business was 6%. GBS quota-bearing headcount was up 18% year-over-year. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the first quarter was $65 million, ahead of our expectations as we saw strong performance with both exhibitors and attendees. The first quarter is always a seasonally small quarter, but we are off to a strong start for the year. Contribution margin in the quarter was 41%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held ten destination conferences in the quarter, all in-person. First quarter Consulting revenues increased by 10% year-over-year to $127 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 14%. Consulting contribution margin was 40% in the first quarter, consistent with the incremental hiring and return to travel. Labor-based revenues were $97 million, up 1% versus Q1 of last year and up 5% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at March 31 was $161 million, increasing 14% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking stream. Our Contract Optimization business had another very strong quarter, up 53% as reported and 56% on an FX-neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services increased 15% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 17% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth. We also saw an increase in cost year-over-year with a return to in-person conferences. SG&A increased 6% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth. The increase was partially offset by lower charges associated with real estate rationalization. EBITDA for the first quarter was $379 million, up 15% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 19% FX neutral. First quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our expectations in Conferences and Consulting and prudent expense planning. Depreciation in the quarter of $24 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $26 million, down $4 million versus the first quarter of 2022, resulting from higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 18% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust that income was 35% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2.88, up 24% year-over-year. We had 80 million shares outstanding in the first quarter. This is a reduction of close to three million shares or about 3% year-over-year. We exited the first quarter with about 80 million shares on an unweighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $165 million, down 2% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $21 million, up 22% year-over-year as a result of an increase in technology modernization investments and equipment for new associates. Free cash flow for the quarter was $144 million. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue on a rolling four-quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 65% of EBITDA. Adjusted for the after-tax impact of the divestiture and interest rate swap gains, free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 120%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. At the end of the first quarter, we had $894 million of cash. Our March 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provides ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.9 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased more than $100 million of stock during the first quarter. We had about $950 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization at March 31. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are increasing our full year guidance to reflect the strong Q1 performance, while still allowing for a higher-than-normal level of uncertainty in the world. As we move through the year, we have more visibility into the revenue outlook and the corresponding expenses needed to support the business and drive growth. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Our plans for 2023 allows for a higher-than-normal range of outcomes as we discussed last quarter. We\u2019ve got tough compares across the business and particularly with tech vendors and in GBS for another quarter or two. We\u2019ve taken a prudent approach based on historical trends, which we\u2019ve reflected in the guidance. We expect stronger growth from the subscription business than the non-subscription part of the segment. The non-subscription part of the business faces tough compares and has more direct exposure to tech vendor spending. The outlook continues to be based on 100% of our 47 destination conferences for 2023 running in person. There is seasonality to the business based on the conferences calendar, which is different than the historical matter. We expect Q4 to be the largest quarter and Q3 to be the smallest of the year. For Consulting revenues, we have more visibility into the second quarter than the second half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization remains highly variable. We had a very strong year in 2022, especially in contract optimization in the fourth quarter. With Q1 behind us, we are comfortable we can run the business successfully for this year, while investing for future growth with lower consolidated expenses than we built into the original guidance. We will continue both to manage expense prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins. Our updated guidance for 2023 is as follows: We expect research revenue of at least $4.925 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 7% or 8% excluding the Q1 divestiture. Research revenue guidance is up modestly from February. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $470 million, which is growth of about 21%. We have increased our outlook for Conferences by $25 million. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $505 million, which is a growth of about 5% FX neutral and a modest increase from February. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.90 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 8%. Overall, we\u2019ve increased our revenue outlook by $35 million. As I mentioned in the last quarter, we\u2019ve taken a prudent approach to planning for 2023. This applies to revenue, operating expenses and free cash flow. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.33 billion, up $70 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. We expect to be able to deliver on our margin guidance in most economic scenarios. If revenue is stronger than our outlook, we expect upside to EBITDA. We now expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $9.50. For 2023, we still expect free cash flow of at least $920 million. This reflects the conversion from GAAP net income of almost 140% excluding the after-tax divestiture proceeds. Our guidance is based on 80 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of March. Finally, for the second quarter of 2023, we expect EBITDA of at least $350 million. We had a strong start to the year despite continuing global macro uncertainty with notable performance in Conferences and overall profitability. Contract value grew double digits. EPS grew more than 20%. We repurchased over $100 million of stock during the first quarter and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. Combining our expected free cash flow generation with the after-tax proceeds of our recent divestiture, we have more than $1 billion available to deploy on behalf of our shareholders in 2023. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we\u2019ll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operator, and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeffrey Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yes, thank you. So I thought CV was good considering the macro and the comp. I know that you said comps are still tough another quarter or two. I don\u2019t know what macro is going to do later in the year. But it sounds like the relative weakness is still just concentrated in the tech vendor channel. So, I guess, as you look at retention trends on business that\u2019s coming up for renewal on a quarterly basis or new business sold trends in a quarter on a seasonally adjusted sequential basis, I guess the question is, have those metrics kind of stabilized after stepping down concentrated in the tech vendor channel last year? Or have you seen any sort of incremental weakening, including with the recent banking sector challenges and any derivative effects from it?\nGene Hall: Jeff, it\u2019s Gene. I think you characterized it right, which is the two biggest factors going on are the year-over-year comparison is very tough because it\u2019s such a strong for a year ago. And then the whole tech industry is realigning and that\u2019s impacting the business, just as you described. And there are smaller things going on, but those are the big things that are going on that\u2019s affecting our business.\nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. But are those smaller things, including like the banking challenges, are they causing incremental deterioration, or is that not a meaningful factor for you?\nGene Hall: Yes, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u2013 I would characterize it as small as opposed to meaningful. So clearly, we\u2019re selling less at Silicon Valley Bank or Republic, but that\u2019s pretty isolated. And so we have isolated things like that are going on, like with regional banks, some countries like China. But there is always things like that going on. There is always things and surprisingly there were increased segments that are not perfect.\nJeffrey Meuler: Got it. Good to hear. And then I just love your perspective, Gene on, I guess, the opportunities and risks from generative AI, including anything on how far along you are with implementing it. And to me, I could see potential benefits on a number of fronts, sales productivity, research productivity, I guess, improving the client experience on your platform, given the high-quality content library, as well as you mentioned among the hot topic areas that could drive demand and client engagement. Also curious just on how you think about any potential risks that publicly available content becomes a lot easier to curate via generative AI. Thanks.\nGene Hall: Yes. So we see generative AI as being really helpful for our business. As you said, there are a lot of internal efficiencies where we\u2019ve had \u2013 five years ago, we had teams of humans coming through publicly available information. Now we actually today use generative AI to improve our efficiency on those kinds of things and we\u2019ll continue to. The second area is that we are testing, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get to at some point, is having more of a natural language interface for our clients. And we\u2019re testing now to just to make sure it all works correctly and it doesn\u2019t have any surprises as you have seen in some of the public situations. And so I\u2019d say, first of all, it\u2019s great for internal efficiencies in every part of our business. Even like you mentioned if a salesperson wants to get synthesized publicly available information, it\u2019s a great tool of help with that. It\u2019s going to be \u2013 so it will help our internal efficiencies, it will provide a better interface over time with our clients and frankly, it\u2019s an area where clients see help on as well. And so that\u2019s an area that helps with our basic client demand as well. You asked about kind of our situation competitively there. I would say we are highly differentiated from kind of the public information you get, because we have a lot of proprietary information, proprietary insights, we have a research process, which is quite important in generating these proprietary insights and of course, we\u2019re independent objective. So we say generational AI has really been a lot of help both internal efficiencies with probably a better interface with our clients, helping clients with it, et cetera.\nJeffrey Meuler: Appreciate the comprehensive answer. Thank you. \nOperator: One moment for our next question. We have a question from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Can you help us think about the cadence of CV as we move through the year, both taking into account the sort of environment right now, especially with your tech vendors as well as just sort of comparisons year-over-year. Just curious kind of do you expect the kind of softness as the year progresses and improvement to the fourth quarter? Just what\u2019s based into your sales outlook? Thanks.\nCraig Safian: Hey good morning Heather. This is Craig. Great question. So, as we think about the way the business rolls, I guess, just zooming back a little bit, a couple of points just around historically how things look. So, we typically generate our least amount of new business dollars in the first quarter of the year and our most amount of new business dollars in the fourth quarter of the year. And there\u2019s a lot of reasons for that. We work through our pipeline in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve got a lot of conferences that we leverage in the fourth quarter. We make a lot of promotions and changes to positions in the first quarter. But first quarter generally, lowest amount of new business. Fourth quarter, a lot more new business, and that sort of builds over the quarters. In terms of the way the CV flows, first quarter and fourth quarter tend to be a little bit more heavily weighted in terms of the amount of CV that is expiring. It can vary a lot. Our sales teams will also often pull forward business as they see opportunities. But Q1 and Q4 are typically our highest expiration quarters. In terms of the comps and the comparisons, I think, if you look back, Q1 of 2022 on just about every measure you can look at was the peak and/or the toughest comparison for us whether it is overall contract value growth, wallet retention, productivity, you name it. The comparisons are still pretty tough through Q2 and Q3, most notably with our tech vendor clients and with GBS. So Q1, I\u2019d say, was a tough comparison across the board, across the entire research business, again, most notably with tech vendors and with GBS. Q2 is still, again, if you go back and look at the metrics and CV growth, et cetera, still a very tough comparison there as well. The comparisons do ease a little bit but it\u2019s still a pretty high comparison point even as we get into the second half of the year. But again, if you think about our normal cadence, we\u2019ll be building our new business pipelines and building our new business dollars over the course of the year. We\u2019ve got a full slate of in-person conferences as well. And as Gene mentioned, our clients and potential clients really need our help as well. So we're focused on making sure we deliver great value to our clients, to drive those renewal rates and also work all our opportunities through the pipeline as well, so we can deliver the new business that we need to deliver as well.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. I appreciate that. And as my follow-up, in an environment like we're seeing right now, whether it's the tech industry, realigning what's going on in banks, from both the GBS and GTS perspective what are you doing on the research side to say to customers keeping them active Gartner customer [indiscernible] keeping that retention strong? Thanks.\nGene Hall: Yes, it's a great question. So we're always focused on research on the things that are most important to our clients. If you think about today, it would be things like cybersecurity. There are a few enterprises today that can let their guard down as cybersecurity and the only help they can get, so that's an area that we're really focused on. The other one is using data analytics and their business. The other one is cost optimization, making sure they understand how to optimize the cost that they do value in a little tougher environment perhaps. We still see a lot of demand on conversion digital business. We also see a lot of demand on things like optimizing cloud computing. So those are some examples. But the way we're focusing on research is making sure our research is focused on the really tough issues that senior leaders and our clients have to wrestle with, which these are some of the examples. And those issues are really important, even for organizations that are struggling, you're still going to deal with things like cybersecurity and data analytics, optimizing cloud computing. And so it's something that applies whether clients are struggling or whether they're thriving.\nHeather Balsky: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment. We have a question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thank so much. Wanted to ask about GBS, I know you mentioned in the prepared remarks that all of the areas grew double digits, except for sales and marketing. Can you just give maybe a little bit of color on what slowed there, anything you're seeing? Or is that just a \u2013 maybe is a tough comp? Or I'm sure each quarter, some are more positive and some are more negative. So is it sort of normal or anything to call out there?\nGene Hall: Yes. Toni, it's a great question. So if you look at in any business, there's always some units that are doing very well because they have all the pieces that are working well together. There's other units that aren't working quite as well, and that's what's going in sales and marketing is it's more operational and kind of our own operational effectiveness isn't as good as in some of the other GBS functions. But there's nothing sort of intrinsic. There's nothing in the marketplace or something like that. It's all about making sure that we have all the pieces really working together well. It still had great growth, but it's not as great. The GBS growth is really extremely strong, and they were just kind of not as strong as the strongest parts of GBS.\nToni Kaplan: Great. Wanted to also ask about the retention of salespeople, I imagine it's a lot better now than it was in recent history when we had the sort of tighter later labor market. I guess how are you thinking about that with regard to maturity of salespeople? Could that have upside potential for the guide this year? And maybe talk about sort of if we should see productivity improvement as a result.\nGene Hall: Yes, Toni, it's a great question, and salespeople are critical to our business to both current business and future growth. We got behind in hiring over the last couple of years. We're now fully caught up, which is fantastic. We have very low number of open positions. And our turnover is among the lowest we've ever seen with our salespeople. It takes our salespeople about three years to get to full productivity. So all these salespeople that we've added recently, you think about are really going to be powering the growth of business in 2024 and 2025 when they get up to full productivity. As we see this lower retention rate \u2013 I'm sorry, higher retention, lower turnover rate as being really advantageous to the business. The other thing is that as we do have hiring needs either from turnover or from growth, the market for us hiring salespeople is fantastic. We can get really fantastic salespeople, and we always see great salespeople, but it's one of the best markets for hiring for us we've ever seen.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nSeth Weber: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about the raised EBITDA margin outlook for the year. Is that just a function of higher revenue flowing through? Or is there something else that you feel like has changed there relative to how you were thinking about the business last quarter? Thanks.\nCraig Safian: Hey. Good morning, Seth. So the \u2013 if you look at the outlook raise based on the Q1 performance and based on our efforts the balance of the year, we took revenue up by $35 million, most notably in conferences and we reduced our OpEx expense outlook by about $35 million. And that's what drove the $70 million increase in the overall EBITDA outlook. I'd say we are still dealing with a pretty uncertain macro environment, as we've all talked about. We took a pretty prudent approach to, in particular planning our operating expenses as we entered the year. And now that we've got three of four months behind us and have a better outlook for what the top line is going to look like for the full year, we were able to refine the expenses a bit. And so again, that's why we're able to raise the revenue by 35% and reduce the OpEx outlook by $35 million as well, and again, the math on that yielded margins a little bit higher than we had initially guided to.\nSeth Weber: Right. That makes sense. Thanks. And then maybe just on the maintained free cash flow outlook. Anything you'd call out there? I seem to remember, over the last couple of quarters, there were some pickups with collections and things like that. Is there anything notable that you cite not raising the free cash flow guidance?\nCraig Safian: Yes. It's a good call out. So I think stepping back for a second, the free cash flow is still a very large number of the conversion numbers look very strong as well, both on a rolling four-quarter basis, and as we extrapolate out of the forecast. The main thing there though is we would have been able to raise our free cash outlook, if not for an additional cash tax burden that we calculated associated with the divestitures. So we had a very strong profit year last year, which results in more cash taxes this year, which was baked into the initial guidance. We sold a small non-core business in February and got proceeds from that. Our initial guide didn't dial in enough cash taxes associated with the divestiture. And so the main thing here is free cash flow is really, really strong would have raised but for an additional cash tax burden associated with our recent divestiture.\nSeth Weber: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is open.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to follow up on a few of the earlier questions to start; first, I guess, Craig, on the margins could you spend a bit of time talking on first quarter upside or where some of that upside came from on the cost side? And then understanding the EBITDA guidance bridge or the change versus last quarter, it still seems like there's a pretty significant ramp-up in implied expenses through the remainder of the year. If you could just give a little bit more color on that. I was under the impression that second half hiring activity was now in the run rate. So just trying to figure out where else the increased expense comes from over the next couple of quarters.\nCraig Safian: Yes, absolutely, Andrew. Thanks for the question. In terms of Q1, I'd say it was a combination of modest revenue be most notably in Conferences, but a little bit in Consulting as well and prudent expense planning in the quarter. So I think that's the way I would describe of the Q1 margin performance. In terms of looking forward, if you think about the composition of our expenses and the phasing of our business, if you use the Q1 adjusted operating expense number as sort of a baseline, remember that like three quarters of our expenses are people related, and our merit increase goes into effect on April 1. And so that causes a step-up in the OpEx rolling out in Q2, Q3, Q4. Our conference calendar also picks up, most notably Q2 and Q4. And so the step up in operating expenses associated with that. Our travel tends to pick-up and we spend more seasonally Q2 and Q4, and so that's a pickup in the OpEx as well. And so again, I think we're \u2013 we planned our revenue outlook pretty carefully and again keeping in mind the proud volatile macro environment. And the OpEx, to your point we've already got a lot of the hiring from last year, that is now in the Q1 run rate for sure. We've got a modest amount of growth hiring set for the balance of this year, just to continue and support the growth. And then you've got those dynamics I just listed out earlier, the biggest two probably being the merit increase going into effect and the conference calendar impacting OpEx Q2 through Q4.\nAndrew Nicholas: Very helpful. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to ask a little bit more on headcount growth and kind of talent environment. I guess, Gene, you mentioned it being fantastic. I guess, one, can you talk a little bit about why you think the environment for hiring sales talent is so good today versus a year ago maybe? And then also how much does that impact your ability to be nimble on the headcount front? It would seem like if there's a bunch of supply, you can be a little bit more careful and not feel like you need to hoard all the best people right away? Or is it a different dynamic where you decide to take advantage of all that's out there and potentially have a little bit narrower gap between headcount growth and CV growth? Just how you're thinking about those dynamics? Thank you.\nGene Hall: Yes. Andrew, so the reason the market is so good is, first, I mean, we're an employer of choice. We have a great brand in the marketplace, and we have great recruiting teams. So there's a lot of operational reasons why things are going well. On top of that then, the whole check realignment, the talent market that we compete most in for our people is with technology companies. And so when they're laying people off and not as aggressive about hiring, obviously it helps us if that's the primary talent market. So it's a combination of we're a great place to work, we have a great reputation, we have great recruiting teams, combined with the fact that our traditional talent competitors are just really scaled and really scaled back hiring a lot. And so we're using that as an opportunity to make sure we hire really great people. As we look forward, as Craig and I both said in our remarks, we want to make sure our net hiring incorporates the turner we have as well as our CV growth so that we are hiring a bit behind our CV growth so that we, it doesn't impact our margins negatively.\nAndrew Nicholas: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Alright. Thanks. Good morning. You talked about Research CV being relatively stable in end markets outside of tech vendors. Just going back to that topic, can you elaborate on what you're seeing in other verticals? How would you characterize the selling environment? How are client budgets performing? And what are you seeing with sales cycles?\nGene Hall: So \u2013 hey, George. So what I say is that it's kind of what we \u2013 normal in the sense that there are some companies that are thriving, there are some companies that are more challenged. And we have to tailor the problems that we're working on with what the company situation is. And again, it gets back to the strategy I talked about earlier, which is let's make sure our research is focused on the most important issues for our clients. And then let's also make sure that our sales people, our sales delivery people know what those topics are, it can be right up front and helping clients. And so as I mentioned before, it's things like cybersecurity, data analytics, cost optimization, building a digital business, optimizing cloud computing, and not every company has all of those, but the \u2013 if you look at each kind of the company, depending on where they are, we help them with the issues that are most important for them.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. And then as it relates to your research sales headcount expectations, can you outline what the cadence of hiring should look like in GBS and GTS over the remainder of this year now that the bulk of hiring is behind you?\nCraig Safian: Yes, George, good morning. Especially and again as Gene and I both mentioned in prepared remarks, we are with a lot of agility, making sure that we are calibrating appropriately where we exit this year from an overall headcount perspective across all Gartner and in particular, in terms of frontline sellers in both GTS and GBS. And so there's a range of outcomes for the full year from both a contract value growth perspective but also from a headcount perspective. And given all the dynamics we talked about in the labor markets and the fact that we've got world-class recruiting, our talent acquisition organization, and we've got a great associate value proposition as well. We feel like we can be pretty agile on this and just make sure that we are appropriately calibrated so that we enter next year with enough investment to make sure that we can sustain growth, but also deliver really strong margin performance as well.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. Wanted to focus on the research pricing environment, if you can remind us what price increases you've been pushing through so far this year, what your expectations are for the rest of the year? And I know others in this space may not necessarily be direct competitors, but we're seeing some companies extending terms of their contract renewals but taking lower price. Is that something that you're doing or considering? Thanks.\nCraig Safian: Good morning, Jeff. In terms of our pricing, the bulk of our pricing goes into effect on November 1 and so which impacts this current year. And so if you recall back to November-ish of 2021 we were increasing prices in the 5% to 6% range. This past cycle it was more closer to 5%, again given a little bit of less inflationary environment. And again, we want to make sure that at a minimum, we are pricing to offset the wage inflation that we are seeing. And in 2021, we were seeing much more pressure on wage inflation, and so we went a little bit harder on the price increases then; this year a little less and so roughly around 5%. In terms of the environment and giving on terms or anything like that, generally, I'd say we're \u2013 we've managed to hold to our terms. And so we're not giving away extra days or months in terms of when we could get paid. We're still pushing very hard on getting paid up front, which is obviously a core part of our free cash flow machine. As Gene and I have all talked about in the past, generally our contracts are relatively small or small-ish ticket items for our clients, representing a pretty teeny portion of their overall budgets. And so we're generally able to again, not without negotiations and not without conversations, but hold to our pricing structure, so no discounting and holding strong on our terms as well.\nJeff Silber: Okay. That's helpful. If I switch to the Consulting segment, I know it can be choppy, but utilization was down pretty significantly in the first quarter. Can we talk about what's going on or what your expectations are for the rest of the year on that metric? Thanks.\nGene Hall: Yes, great question. On the Consulting side, we \u2013 like in a lot of our business we're playing catch-up on headcount and hiring over the course of last year. And so we did grow the team based on the demand we were seeing fairly aggressively over the back half of last year. We're still seeing really good demand. We're in a really good backlog position exiting Q1. And I'd say we ran a little bit hotter than normal in utilization last year, particularly in the first half of the year but overall last year, so it's a tough comp from that perspective. And again, just like the rest of the business, we are making sure that we are appropriately calibrated from a headcount perspective and a demand perspective, and we feel like we're in that situation right now with Consulting. We've got strong demand. We've got good backlog, and we'll continue to monitor it to make sure that we can both deliver on the top line but also make sure we're delivering strong margins there as well.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Craig, I was just hoping on the expense side, specific to SG&A, you could help us with just the cadence through the quarters there. And is the S-part still like two-thirds of that mix right now?\nCraig Safian: Good morning, Manav. Yes. So the \u2013 so if you look at the SG&A line, again think of it running mid-40s to high-40s as a percent of revenue on a rolling four-quarter basis. About two-thirds of it is the S-part or the selling portion, most notably, GTS and GBS selling. Although we do have our conference sales organizations and a few other sales organizations in the S-line as well. And the cadence of spending is similar to what I outlined with Andrew's question, few questions ago, look at the Q1 rough OpEx run rate and SG&A \u2013 adjusted SG&A run rate. Merit goes into effect on April 1, and so that impacts that run rate for Q2, Q3, Q4. As I mentioned, travel \u2013 we do travel more in Q2 and Q4. And so you bake that in, and if you bake those things in, you should have a pretty good view on how SG&A expense should look Q2, Q3, Q4 of this year.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just my second question was more, can you remind us what your multiyear contract? Like how much of your business is now multiyear contract, what that average duration is because that should help you be obviously more resilient here?\nCraig Safian: Yes, absolutely. So our overall multiyear contracts as a percent of the research business is around 70%. So about 70% of the contracts that we have in force are multi-year in nature. The bulk of them are two-year contracts, although we do have a growing but small segment of more than two-year contracts. Important to note that some multi-year contracts will come due this year, obviously, but you're right, in terms of the resiliency of the business clearly having a large portion of our contract value tied up in multi-year contracts that are not up for renewal over the course of 2023 is clearly a good thing for us. And we recognize the strategic importance and value of focusing on multi-year contracts. Our salespeople do as well. Our clients do as well quite frankly; it's good for them too. But it's clearly a strong element of the business that we have so much tied up in multi-year contracts, but again most of them are two-year contracts.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment. We have a question from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open. Stephanie, your line is open.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. Yes. No. Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to touch on the comp side of the business, clearly really strong growth. Would love to get more color on what you're hearing in regards to maybe advanced bookings and other demand if that demand has changed all versus maybe throughput levels to still [indiscernible]?\nGene Hall: Yes, Stephanie, it's a great question. So Conferences are a really important part of our business, and we're seeing very robust demand for Conferences, both from attendees and from exhibitors. My own take on it is that there's a lot of pent-up demand to do in-person events, of which our Conferences are part of that. And so we're seeing very strong demand on all parts of the business.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you. And then just for a follow-up. I'm curious what you're seeing in general on the Consulting side from just an overall upselling and cross-selling standpoint. Maybe any customers or clients in part that are pulling back at all on just number of fees just given the uncertain macro? Or you're still kind of seeing the same level of activity? Thank you.\nCraig Safian: Hi Stephanie its Craig. So just to clarify your question because I'm not sure I heard it completely. I heard Consulting at the beginning, but then I heard research. So could you just repeat the question? Would you mind?\nStephanie Moore: No. I'm sorry. I apologize. I was just curious on what you're seeing from an upsell and cross-sell standpoint, and if you've seen any change in activity as of late, maybe clients pulling back at all? Thank you.\nCraig Safian: Yes. So I think clearly with our tech vendor clients as we've described in detail, the upsell is certainly more challenging in this environment given their recalibration and sort of the tumult [ph] in that space. We're still upselling wherever we can. I do think in the particularly challenged areas like tech vendors, what we are seeing our clients really get huge value out of Gartner and so they don't want to fully cancel their relationships, and so they may reduce a license or two here or there. We're seeing that in some of the more challenged end user industries as well, like as Gene mentioned, regional banking or things like that. But overall, I think it all comes back to we're offering a really strong value proposition and our clients really need help. And as long as we're doing that we'll be able to maintain our \u2013 the investment level within clients, and in fact if you look at the wallet retention numbers increase on average the amount of spend each and every year. And then when things in those impacted markets stabilize, we should get right back to the kind of growth that we've historically delivered.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn it back to Gene Hall for closing remarks.\nGene Hall: Well, here's what I'd like you to take away from today's call. In the first quarter of 2023, we again saw strong growth across the business. Gartner delivers incredible value of enterprises that are thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. Our insights address today's mission-critical priorities. And by being exceptionally agile and adapting to the changing world, we've delivered a sustained record of success. We've covered around and aligned our hiring with recent demand and our long-term opportunity. We know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to drive growth far into the future. We expect margins to increase modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. Even as we invest in future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders, which reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Gene. And good morning. First quarter results were strong with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. FX-neutral growth was even stronger than our reported results. We also again delivered better-than-planned EBITDA margins. The upside reflected stronger Conferences and Consulting revenue and disciplined cost management. With results ahead of our expectations, we are increasing our 2023 guidance. First quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, up 12% year-over-year as reported and 14% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, down 103 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $379 million, up 15% year-over-year and up 19% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.88 up 24%. And free cash flow in the quarter was $144 million. We finished the quarter with 19,830 associates, up 15% from the prior year and 2% from the end of the fourth quarter. We are well positioned from a talent perspective with low levels of open territories and our new associates coming up the ten-year curve. And we will continue to carefully calibrate headcount and operating expenses based on near-term revenue growth and opportunities to invest for the future. Research revenue in the first quarter grew 7% year-over-year as reported and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 11%, FX neutral. First quarter research contribution margin was 74%, down about one point as we have caught up on hiring and return to the new expected levels of travel. Contract value or CV was $4.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 10% versus the prior year. The first quarter last year was one of our strongest research quarters ever with outstanding performance on nearly every metric we provide. CV growth is FX neutral and excludes both Russia and the recent divestiture. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew at double-digit rates. CV from tech vendors grew mid-single digits compared to high teens growth in the first quarter of 2022. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $26 million. As we've discussed in the past, there is notable seasonality in this metric. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, all industry sectors grew at double-digit rates other than technology and media, which both grew at mid-single-digit rates. The fastest growth was in the transportation, retail and public sectors. We had high single-digit growth across all of our enterprise size categories. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in all of our top ten countries. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.5 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 9% versus the prior year. GTS had quarterly NCVI of $10 million. While retention for GTS was 104% for the quarter, which compares to 107% in the prior year when we saw a record high for this metric. While tech vendor wallet retention remained under pressure, on a net basis, our clients spend more with us compared to the prior year. GTS new business was down 1% versus last year. New business with IT function leaders increased compared to the prior year against the tough compare. New business with tech vendors declined versus very strong performance last year. GTS quota-bearing headcount was up 22% year-over-year and 11% on a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. We will continue to manage hiring based on both short-term performance and the medium-term opportunity. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $983 million at the end of the first quarter, up 16% year-over-year, which is at the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. All of our GBS practices other than sales and marketing grew at double-digit rates. Supply chain and HR both continued to grow faster than 20%. GBS CV increased $16 million from the fourth quarter. While retention for GBS was 110% for the quarter, which compares to 115% in the prior year when we saw the highest end result for this metric. In addition to continued strong client retention, our clients spent significantly more with us than they did a year ago. GBS new business was down 4% compared to last year against a very strong compare. The two-year compound annual growth rate for new business was 6%. GBS quota-bearing headcount was up 18% year-over-year. This excludes headcount associated with the Q1 divestiture. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in the appendix of our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the first quarter was $65 million, ahead of our expectations as we saw strong performance with both exhibitors and attendees. The first quarter is always a seasonally small quarter, but we are off to a strong start for the year. Contribution margin in the quarter was 41%, consistent with typical seasonality. We held ten destination conferences in the quarter, all in-person. First quarter Consulting revenues increased by 10% year-over-year to $127 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 14%. Consulting contribution margin was 40% in the first quarter, consistent with the incremental hiring and return to travel. Labor-based revenues were $97 million, up 1% versus Q1 of last year and up 5% on an FX neutral basis. Backlog at March 31 was $161 million, increasing 14% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking stream. Our Contract Optimization business had another very strong quarter, up 53% as reported and 56% on an FX-neutral basis versus the prior year. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services increased 15% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 17% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher headcount to support our continued strong growth. We also saw an increase in cost year-over-year with a return to in-person conferences. SG&A increased 6% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 9% on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth. The increase was partially offset by lower charges associated with real estate rationalization. EBITDA for the first quarter was $379 million, up 15% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 19% FX neutral. First quarter EBITDA upside to our guidance reflected revenue exceeding our expectations in Conferences and Consulting and prudent expense planning. Depreciation in the quarter of $24 million was up modestly compared to 2022. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $26 million, down $4 million versus the first quarter of 2022, resulting from higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through maturity. The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 18% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust that income was 35% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2.88, up 24% year-over-year. We had 80 million shares outstanding in the first quarter. This is a reduction of close to three million shares or about 3% year-over-year. We exited the first quarter with about 80 million shares on an unweighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $165 million, down 2% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $21 million, up 22% year-over-year as a result of an increase in technology modernization investments and equipment for new associates. Free cash flow for the quarter was $144 million. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue on a rolling four-quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 65% of EBITDA. Adjusted for the after-tax impact of the divestiture and interest rate swap gains, free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 120%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. At the end of the first quarter, we had $894 million of cash. Our March 31 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under two times. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provides ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.9 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased more than $100 million of stock during the first quarter. We had about $950 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization at March 31. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are increasing our full year guidance to reflect the strong Q1 performance, while still allowing for a higher-than-normal level of uncertainty in the world. As we move through the year, we have more visibility into the revenue outlook and the corresponding expenses needed to support the business and drive growth. For research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Our plans for 2023 allows for a higher-than-normal range of outcomes as we discussed last quarter. We've got tough compares across the business and particularly with tech vendors and in GBS for another quarter or two. We've taken a prudent approach based on historical trends, which we've reflected in the guidance. We expect stronger growth from the subscription business than the non-subscription part of the segment. The non-subscription part of the business faces tough compares and has more direct exposure to tech vendor spending. The outlook continues to be based on 100% of our 47 destination conferences for 2023 running in person. There is seasonality to the business based on the conferences calendar, which is different than the historical matter. We expect Q4 to be the largest quarter and Q3 to be the smallest of the year. For Consulting revenues, we have more visibility into the second quarter than the second half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. Contract optimization remains highly variable. We had a very strong year in 2022, especially in contract optimization in the fourth quarter. With Q1 behind us, we are comfortable we can run the business successfully for this year, while investing for future growth with lower consolidated expenses than we built into the original guidance. We will continue both to manage expense prudently to support future growth and deliver strong margins. Our updated guidance for 2023 is as follows: We expect research revenue of at least $4.925 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 7% or 8% excluding the Q1 divestiture. Research revenue guidance is up modestly from February. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $470 million, which is growth of about 21%. We have increased our outlook for Conferences by $25 million. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $505 million, which is a growth of about 5% FX neutral and a modest increase from February. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $5.90 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 8%. Overall, we've increased our revenue outlook by $35 million. As I mentioned in the last quarter, we've taken a prudent approach to planning for 2023. This applies to revenue, operating expenses and free cash flow. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.33 billion, up $70 million from our prior guidance and an increase in our margin outlook as well. We expect to be able to deliver on our margin guidance in most economic scenarios. If revenue is stronger than our outlook, we expect upside to EBITDA. We now expect 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $9.50. For 2023, we still expect free cash flow of at least $920 million. This reflects the conversion from GAAP net income of almost 140% excluding the after-tax divestiture proceeds. Our guidance is based on 80 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of March. Finally, for the second quarter of 2023, we expect EBITDA of at least $350 million. We had a strong start to the year despite continuing global macro uncertainty with notable performance in Conferences and overall profitability. Contract value grew double digits. EPS grew more than 20%. We repurchased over $100 million of stock during the first quarter and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. Combining our expected free cash flow generation with the after-tax proceeds of our recent divestiture, we have more than $1 billion available to deploy on behalf of our shareholders in 2023. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Hey good morning Heather. This is Craig. Great question. So, as we think about the way the business rolls, I guess, just zooming back a little bit, a couple of points just around historically how things look. So, we typically generate our least amount of new business dollars in the first quarter of the year and our most amount of new business dollars in the fourth quarter of the year. And there's a lot of reasons for that. We work through our pipeline in the fourth quarter. We've got a lot of conferences that we leverage in the fourth quarter. We make a lot of promotions and changes to positions in the first quarter. But first quarter generally, lowest amount of new business. Fourth quarter, a lot more new business, and that sort of builds over the quarters. In terms of the way the CV flows, first quarter and fourth quarter tend to be a little bit more heavily weighted in terms of the amount of CV that is expiring. It can vary a lot. Our sales teams will also often pull forward business as they see opportunities. But Q1 and Q4 are typically our highest expiration quarters. In terms of the comps and the comparisons, I think, if you look back, Q1 of 2022 on just about every measure you can look at was the peak and/or the toughest comparison for us whether it is overall contract value growth, wallet retention, productivity, you name it. The comparisons are still pretty tough through Q2 and Q3, most notably with our tech vendor clients and with GBS. So Q1, I'd say, was a tough comparison across the board, across the entire research business, again, most notably with tech vendors and with GBS. Q2 is still, again, if you go back and look at the metrics and CV growth, et cetera, still a very tough comparison there as well. The comparisons do ease a little bit but it's still a pretty high comparison point even as we get into the second half of the year. But again, if you think about our normal cadence, we'll be building our new business pipelines and building our new business dollars over the course of the year. We've got a full slate of in-person conferences as well. And as Gene mentioned, our clients and potential clients really need our help as well. So we're focused on making sure we deliver great value to our clients, to drive those renewal rates and also work all our opportunities through the pipeline as well, so we can deliver the new business that we need to deliver as well. Hey. Good morning, Seth. So the \u2013 if you look at the outlook raise based on the Q1 performance and based on our efforts the balance of the year, we took revenue up by $35 million, most notably in conferences and we reduced our OpEx expense outlook by about $35 million. And that's what drove the $70 million increase in the overall EBITDA outlook. I'd say we are still dealing with a pretty uncertain macro environment, as we've all talked about. We took a pretty prudent approach to, in particular planning our operating expenses as we entered the year. And now that we've got three of four months behind us and have a better outlook for what the top line is going to look like for the full year, we were able to refine the expenses a bit. And so again, that's why we're able to raise the revenue by 35% and reduce the OpEx outlook by $35 million as well, and again, the math on that yielded margins a little bit higher than we had initially guided to. Yes. It's a good call out. So I think stepping back for a second, the free cash flow is still a very large number of the conversion numbers look very strong as well, both on a rolling four-quarter basis, and as we extrapolate out of the forecast. The main thing there though is we would have been able to raise our free cash outlook, if not for an additional cash tax burden that we calculated associated with the divestitures. So we had a very strong profit year last year, which results in more cash taxes this year, which was baked into the initial guidance. We sold a small non-core business in February and got proceeds from that. Our initial guide didn't dial in enough cash taxes associated with the divestiture. And so the main thing here is free cash flow is really, really strong would have raised but for an additional cash tax burden associated with our recent divestiture. Yes, absolutely, Andrew. Thanks for the question. In terms of Q1, I'd say it was a combination of modest revenue be most notably in Conferences, but a little bit in Consulting as well and prudent expense planning in the quarter. So I think that's the way I would describe of the Q1 margin performance. In terms of looking forward, if you think about the composition of our expenses and the phasing of our business, if you use the Q1 adjusted operating expense number as sort of a baseline, remember that like three quarters of our expenses are people related, and our merit increase goes into effect on April 1. And so that causes a step-up in the OpEx rolling out in Q2, Q3, Q4. Our conference calendar also picks up, most notably Q2 and Q4. And so the step up in operating expenses associated with that. Our travel tends to pick-up and we spend more seasonally Q2 and Q4, and so that's a pickup in the OpEx as well. And so again, I think we're \u2013 we planned our revenue outlook pretty carefully and again keeping in mind the proud volatile macro environment. And the OpEx, to your point we've already got a lot of the hiring from last year, that is now in the Q1 run rate for sure. We've got a modest amount of growth hiring set for the balance of this year, just to continue and support the growth. And then you've got those dynamics I just listed out earlier, the biggest two probably being the merit increase going into effect and the conference calendar impacting OpEx Q2 through Q4. Yes, George, good morning. Especially and again as Gene and I both mentioned in prepared remarks, we are with a lot of agility, making sure that we are calibrating appropriately where we exit this year from an overall headcount perspective across all Gartner and in particular, in terms of frontline sellers in both GTS and GBS. And so there's a range of outcomes for the full year from both a contract value growth perspective but also from a headcount perspective. And given all the dynamics we talked about in the labor markets and the fact that we've got world-class recruiting, our talent acquisition organization, and we've got a great associate value proposition as well. We feel like we can be pretty agile on this and just make sure that we are appropriately calibrated so that we enter next year with enough investment to make sure that we can sustain growth, but also deliver really strong margin performance as well. Good morning, Jeff. In terms of our pricing, the bulk of our pricing goes into effect on November 1 and so which impacts this current year. And so if you recall back to November-ish of 2021 we were increasing prices in the 5% to 6% range. This past cycle it was more closer to 5%, again given a little bit of less inflationary environment. And again, we want to make sure that at a minimum, we are pricing to offset the wage inflation that we are seeing. And in 2021, we were seeing much more pressure on wage inflation, and so we went a little bit harder on the price increases then; this year a little less and so roughly around 5%. In terms of the environment and giving on terms or anything like that, generally, I'd say we're \u2013 we've managed to hold to our terms. And so we're not giving away extra days or months in terms of when we could get paid. We're still pushing very hard on getting paid up front, which is obviously a core part of our free cash flow machine. As Gene and I have all talked about in the past, generally our contracts are relatively small or small-ish ticket items for our clients, representing a pretty teeny portion of their overall budgets. And so we're generally able to again, not without negotiations and not without conversations, but hold to our pricing structure, so no discounting and holding strong on our terms as well. Good morning, Manav. Yes. So the \u2013 so if you look at the SG&A line, again think of it running mid-40s to high-40s as a percent of revenue on a rolling four-quarter basis. About two-thirds of it is the S-part or the selling portion, most notably, GTS and GBS selling. Although we do have our conference sales organizations and a few other sales organizations in the S-line as well. And the cadence of spending is similar to what I outlined with Andrew's question, few questions ago, look at the Q1 rough OpEx run rate and SG&A \u2013 adjusted SG&A run rate. Merit goes into effect on April 1, and so that impacts that run rate for Q2, Q3, Q4. As I mentioned, travel \u2013 we do travel more in Q2 and Q4. And so you bake that in, and if you bake those things in, you should have a pretty good view on how SG&A expense should look Q2, Q3, Q4 of this year. Yes, absolutely. So our overall multiyear contracts as a percent of the research business is around 70%. So about 70% of the contracts that we have in force are multi-year in nature. The bulk of them are two-year contracts, although we do have a growing but small segment of more than two-year contracts. Important to note that some multi-year contracts will come due this year, obviously, but you're right, in terms of the resiliency of the business clearly having a large portion of our contract value tied up in multi-year contracts that are not up for renewal over the course of 2023 is clearly a good thing for us. And we recognize the strategic importance and value of focusing on multi-year contracts. Our salespeople do as well. Our clients do as well quite frankly; it's good for them too. But it's clearly a strong element of the business that we have so much tied up in multi-year contracts, but again most of them are two-year contracts. Hi Stephanie its Craig. So just to clarify your question because I'm not sure I heard it completely. I heard Consulting at the beginning, but then I heard research. So could you just repeat the question? Would you mind? Yes. So I think clearly with our tech vendor clients as we've described in detail, the upsell is certainly more challenging in this environment given their recalibration and sort of the tumult [ph] in that space. We're still upselling wherever we can. I do think in the particularly challenged areas like tech vendors, what we are seeing our clients really get huge value out of Gartner and so they don't want to fully cancel their relationships, and so they may reduce a license or two here or there. We're seeing that in some of the more challenged end user industries as well, like as Gene mentioned, regional banking or things like that. But overall, I think it all comes back to we're offering a really strong value proposition and our clients really need help. And as long as we're doing that we'll be able to maintain our \u2013 the investment level within clients, and in fact if you look at the wallet retention numbers increase on average the amount of spend each and every year. And then when things in those impacted markets stabilize, we should get right back to the kind of growth that we've historically delivered."

            "content": "Good morning. And thanks for joining us today. Gartner drove strong performance in the first quarter with double-digit growth in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and EPS. The rate of change and uncertainty in the world continues to accelerate. The tech sector is adjusting to post-pandemic demand. The banking industry is grappling with rising interest rates. Many industries have been impacted by rising inflation and more. Enterprise leaders and their teams need actionable objective guidance. Gartner is the best source for the insights, tools and advice that makes the difference between success and failure for these leaders and enterprises they serve. We continue to be agile with the changing times. We're helping our clients make better decisions and achieve their mission-critical priorities, whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. Research continues to be our largest and the most profitable segment. We guide leaders across all major enterprise functions. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever. In the first quarter, we helped clients in a range of traffic, including cybersecurity, data analytics, artificial intelligence, remote work, cost optimization and more. Research revenue grew 9%. Total contract value growth was 10%. Contract value growth was affected by slower than average growth with our technology vendor clients. This also affected the non-subscription portion of our research business. End user contract value for both GTS and GBS continue to grow at strong double-digit rates. We serve executives and their teams through two distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders and technology vendors, including CEOs and product managers. GTS contract value grew 9%. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value grew 16%. Through relentless execution of proven practices, we're able to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. Clients continue to prioritize Gartner Research. Our business remains resilient despite a volatile and complicated external environment. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to engaged and qualified audience. This will be the first full year of in-person conferences since 2019. We're off to a great start. Attention is strong, advanced bookings are at record levels, and feedback continues to be excellent. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended, project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT Research business. Consulting revenue grew 14% in the first quarter. Our business is fueled by our highly talented associates. We have carefully aligned our hiring with recent demand and our long-term opportunity. We are well positioned to drive long-term, sustained double-digit growth. We finished Q1 ahead of our expectations despite volatility in the global environment. We're increasing our outlook for 2023, while still allowing for a higher-than-normal level of uncertainty in the world. Craig will take you through our guidance in more detail. In closing, Gartner achieved another strong quarter of growth. We deliver unparalleled value to enterprise leaders and their teams across every major function whether they are thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. We're exceptionally agile and continuously adapt to the changing world, and we know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. We expect margins to increase modestly over time. And we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. Even as we invest for future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders, which reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Jeff, it's Gene. I think you characterized it right, which is the two biggest factors going on are the year-over-year comparison is very tough because it's such a strong for a year ago. And then the whole tech industry is realigning and that's impacting the business, just as you described. And there are smaller things going on, but those are the big things that are going on that's affecting our business. Yes, I don't think it's \u2013 I would characterize it as small as opposed to meaningful. So clearly, we're selling less at Silicon Valley Bank or Republic, but that's pretty isolated. And so we have isolated things like that are going on, like with regional banks, some countries like China. But there is always things like that going on. There is always things and surprisingly there were increased segments that are not perfect. Yes. So we see generative AI as being really helpful for our business. As you said, there are a lot of internal efficiencies where we've had \u2013 five years ago, we had teams of humans coming through publicly available information. Now we actually today use generative AI to improve our efficiency on those kinds of things and we'll continue to. The second area is that we are testing, and I'm sure we'll get to at some point, is having more of a natural language interface for our clients. And we're testing now to just to make sure it all works correctly and it doesn't have any surprises as you have seen in some of the public situations. And so I'd say, first of all, it's great for internal efficiencies in every part of our business. Even like you mentioned if a salesperson wants to get synthesized publicly available information, it's a great tool of help with that. It's going to be \u2013 so it will help our internal efficiencies, it will provide a better interface over time with our clients and frankly, it's an area where clients see help on as well. And so that's an area that helps with our basic client demand as well. You asked about kind of our situation competitively there. I would say we are highly differentiated from kind of the public information you get, because we have a lot of proprietary information, proprietary insights, we have a research process, which is quite important in generating these proprietary insights and of course, we're independent objective. So we say generational AI has really been a lot of help both internal efficiencies with probably a better interface with our clients, helping clients with it, et cetera. Yes, it's a great question. So we're always focused on research on the things that are most important to our clients. If you think about today, it would be things like cybersecurity. There are a few enterprises today that can let their guard down as cybersecurity and the only help they can get, so that's an area that we're really focused on. The other one is using data analytics and their business. The other one is cost optimization, making sure they understand how to optimize the cost that they do value in a little tougher environment perhaps. We still see a lot of demand on conversion digital business. We also see a lot of demand on things like optimizing cloud computing. So those are some examples. But the way we're focusing on research is making sure our research is focused on the really tough issues that senior leaders and our clients have to wrestle with, which these are some of the examples. And those issues are really important, even for organizations that are struggling, you're still going to deal with things like cybersecurity and data analytics, optimizing cloud computing. And so it's something that applies whether clients are struggling or whether they're thriving. Yes. Toni, it's a great question. So if you look at in any business, there's always some units that are doing very well because they have all the pieces that are working well together. There's other units that aren't working quite as well, and that's what's going in sales and marketing is it's more operational and kind of our own operational effectiveness isn't as good as in some of the other GBS functions. But there's nothing sort of intrinsic. There's nothing in the marketplace or something like that. It's all about making sure that we have all the pieces really working together well. It still had great growth, but it's not as great. The GBS growth is really extremely strong, and they were just kind of not as strong as the strongest parts of GBS. Yes, Toni, it's a great question, and salespeople are critical to our business to both current business and future growth. We got behind in hiring over the last couple of years. We're now fully caught up, which is fantastic. We have very low number of open positions. And our turnover is among the lowest we've ever seen with our salespeople. It takes our salespeople about three years to get to full productivity. So all these salespeople that we've added recently, you think about are really going to be powering the growth of business in 2024 and 2025 when they get up to full productivity. As we see this lower retention rate \u2013 I'm sorry, higher retention, lower turnover rate as being really advantageous to the business. The other thing is that as we do have hiring needs either from turnover or from growth, the market for us hiring salespeople is fantastic. We can get really fantastic salespeople, and we always see great salespeople, but it's one of the best markets for hiring for us we've ever seen. Yes. Andrew, so the reason the market is so good is, first, I mean, we're an employer of choice. We have a great brand in the marketplace, and we have great recruiting teams. So there's a lot of operational reasons why things are going well. On top of that then, the whole check realignment, the talent market that we compete most in for our people is with technology companies. And so when they're laying people off and not as aggressive about hiring, obviously it helps us if that's the primary talent market. So it's a combination of we're a great place to work, we have a great reputation, we have great recruiting teams, combined with the fact that our traditional talent competitors are just really scaled and really scaled back hiring a lot. And so we're using that as an opportunity to make sure we hire really great people. As we look forward, as Craig and I both said in our remarks, we want to make sure our net hiring incorporates the turner we have as well as our CV growth so that we are hiring a bit behind our CV growth so that we, it doesn't impact our margins negatively. So \u2013 hey, George. So what I say is that it's kind of what we \u2013 normal in the sense that there are some companies that are thriving, there are some companies that are more challenged. And we have to tailor the problems that we're working on with what the company situation is. And again, it gets back to the strategy I talked about earlier, which is let's make sure our research is focused on the most important issues for our clients. And then let's also make sure that our sales people, our sales delivery people know what those topics are, it can be right up front and helping clients. And so as I mentioned before, it's things like cybersecurity, data analytics, cost optimization, building a digital business, optimizing cloud computing, and not every company has all of those, but the \u2013 if you look at each kind of the company, depending on where they are, we help them with the issues that are most important for them. Yes, great question. On the Consulting side, we \u2013 like in a lot of our business we're playing catch-up on headcount and hiring over the course of last year. And so we did grow the team based on the demand we were seeing fairly aggressively over the back half of last year. We're still seeing really good demand. We're in a really good backlog position exiting Q1. And I'd say we ran a little bit hotter than normal in utilization last year, particularly in the first half of the year but overall last year, so it's a tough comp from that perspective. And again, just like the rest of the business, we are making sure that we are appropriately calibrated from a headcount perspective and a demand perspective, and we feel like we're in that situation right now with Consulting. We've got strong demand. We've got good backlog, and we'll continue to monitor it to make sure that we can both deliver on the top line but also make sure we're delivering strong margins there as well. Yes, Stephanie, it's a great question. So Conferences are a really important part of our business, and we're seeing very robust demand for Conferences, both from attendees and from exhibitors. My own take on it is that there's a lot of pent-up demand to do in-person events, of which our Conferences are part of that. And so we're seeing very strong demand on all parts of the business. Well, here's what I'd like you to take away from today's call. In the first quarter of 2023, we again saw strong growth across the business. Gartner delivers incredible value of enterprises that are thriving, struggling or anywhere in between. Our insights address today's mission-critical priorities. And by being exceptionally agile and adapting to the changing world, we've delivered a sustained record of success. We've covered around and aligned our hiring with recent demand and our long-term opportunity. We know the right things to do to be successful in any environment. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to drive growth far into the future. We expect margins to increase modestly over time, and we generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. Even as we invest in future growth, we'll return significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders, which reduces shares outstanding and increases returns over time. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents. Now I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nEugene Hall: Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner continues to remain resilient in a complex environment. In Q3, contract value grew high single digits. Financial results for the third quarter were ahead of expectations. We raised our 2024 guidance for revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. Leaders in every enterprise continue to face more simultaneous disruptions than ever before. Gartner is the best source for actionable objective insight to drive smart decisions and stronger performance on an organization's mission-critical priorities. A powerful way to experience our research insights is to attend a Gartner Conference. At the start of every conference, our analysts deliver a thought-provoking keynote on a critically important topic. I recently attended Gartner's IT Symposium Expo in Orlando, Florida. In the opening keynote, our analysts inspired thousands of CIOs and IT executives. They showed these leaders how to implement AI in the right places at the right pace for their environments. The keynote received among the highest ratings ever. Gartner delivers unparalleled value at the intersection of business and technology. We help our clients manage risk, save time, save money and build confidence. We got clients through a wide range of topics. For example, cybersecurity, strategic workforce planning, cost optimization and leveraging generative AI across multiple disciplines, including procurement, brand management and sales enablement. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our research business source leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry and every geography, and our market opportunity is vast. Within our research business, contract value with enterprise function leaders grew 9%. And contract value with tech vendor clients continued the improvement we saw last quarter. We serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. Contract value was 6%, GTS new business growth was 8%. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, legal, sales and more. GBS new business growth was 10% and contract value grew 12%. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. Revenue grew 30% in the third quarter, and we're off to a great start in Q4. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting [indiscernible] execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Labor-based consulting revenue grew 2%. Contract optimization revenue met our expectations. Our road to success has been driven by relentless execution of Gartner best practices. We continuously improve and innovate across our business. I'll share a few examples. First, we deployed a state-of-the-art CRM system across most of our business. Now our teams have greater visibility to better serve our clients. We also added innovations to our phased approach to sales training, which positively impact sales productivity for new hires. One way we capture our large untapped market opportunity is by growing sales headcount. We accelerated hiring in the second half of 2024, and expect to continue growing our sales force into 2025 and beyond. Another example of improvement is with [indiscernible] salespeople. We're growing and refining our [indiscernible] type program that lets early career salespeople gain valuable experience before they take on direct [indiscernible] roles. And we're leveraging AI internally. We've built prototypes that our associates are using to match our vast library of powerful insights to each client situation. And those are just a few examples. Developing creates best practices and executing them consistently is a core part of our strategy. In closing, Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations. We delivered 9% contract value growth with enterprise function leaders. Tech vendor CV growth has turned the corner and continues to accelerate. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We'll continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actionable objective insight to our clients, [indiscernible] investing for future growth and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. We expect to deliver modest margin expansion over time and will continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. All of this and more positions us to continue our sustained track record of success far in the future. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Third quarter contract value grew 7% year-over-year, another good performance in a still complex environment. Third quarter revenue, EBITDA and EPS all came in ahead of our expectations. We are updating our guidance based on the Q3 results and an improved outlook for the fourth quarter. Also during the third quarter, we received $300 million before taxes related to conference cancellation insurance for the conferences affected by the pandemic. We have repurchased more than $630 million of stock through September and remain eager to repurchase shares opportunistically. Third quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and 6% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, consistent with last year. EBITDA was $340 million, up 2% as reported and 3% FX neutral versus the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EPS was $2.50 compared with $2.56 in Q3 of last year. And free cash flow, including the insurance-related proceeds, was $565 million. Research revenue in the third quarter grew 5% year-over-year as reported and FX neutral. Subscription revenue grew 7% FX neutral. Nonsubscription research revenue was in line with our expectations. Third quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with last year. Contract value was $5 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 7% versus the prior year and up about $104 million from the second quarter. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew 9%. Contract value and CV growth are FX neutral. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Tech vendor contract value has turned a corner with strong new business and continued contract value acceleration in Q3. Across our combined practices, half of the industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates, led by the energy, health care and manufacturing sectors. CV grew at high single-digit rates across all enterprise sizes except small, which grew low single digits and has the largest tech vendor mix. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.9 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 6% versus the prior year. GTS enterprise leader CV increased high single digits. Tech vendor CV growth improved from Q2 as the positive shift, which began last quarter, continued. GTS CV increased $67 million from the second quarter, while retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, similar to Q2. Enterprise leader wallet retention was consistent with historical levels. GTS new business was up 8% compared to last year. CTS quota-bearing head count was up 1% year-over-year. We added more than 90 sellers in the quarter, the largest sequential increase since Q4 of 2022. This sets us up to deliver on mid-single-digit QBH growth for GTS by the end of the year. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $1.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 12% year-over-year. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit rates other than marketing and sales, which grew mid-single digits. Growth was led by the finance, legal and supply chain practices. GBS CV increased $37 million from the second quarter. While retention for GBS was 106% for the quarter, which compares to 108% in the prior year, GBS new business was up 10% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing head count was up 8% year-over-year, and we continue to target high single-digit growth for 2024. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the third quarter was $76 million, increasing 32% as reported and 30% FX neutral compared to Q3 of 2023. Contribution margin was 40%, consistent with typical Q3 seasonality. We held 10 destination conferences in the third quarter. Third quarter consulting revenue was $128 million compared with $133 million in the year ago period. Consulting contribution margin was 33% in the third quarter. Labor-based revenue was $101 million, up 2% versus Q3 of last year as reported and FX neutral. Backlog at September 30 was $218 million, increasing 21% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength. In contract optimization, we delivered $26 million of revenue in the quarter with a very tough compare from Q3 of last year. Our contract optimization revenue is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services increased 5% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and FX neutral. The biggest driver of the increase was higher compensation costs. SG&A increased 8% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth, which contributed to higher compensation costs. EBITDA for the third quarter was $340 million, up 2% from last year as reported and up 3% FX neutral. We outperformed in the third quarter through revenue upside, effective expense management and a prudent approach to guidance. Depreciation in the quarter of $29 million was up 18% compared to 2023. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $17 million. This is favorable by $4 million versus the third quarter of 2023 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through the third quarter of 2025. The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 26% for the quarter. This compares to last year's rate of 22%. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 17% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.5 compared with $2.56 last year. We had 78 million shares outstanding in the third quarter. This is an improvement of close to 1.6 million shares or about 2% year-over-year. We exited the third quarter with about 78 million shares on an unweighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $591 million compared with $331 million in Q3 of 2023. This includes $300 million of insurance-related proceeds we received in the quarter. We expect to pay the associated taxes during Q4. CapEx for the quarter was $26 million, in line with our expectations. Free cash flow for the quarter was $565 million, including the insurance-related proceeds. Free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 119% of GAAP net income. Excluding the insurance-related proceeds, free cash flow was 16% of revenue and 63% of EBITDA. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. At the end of the third quarter, we had about $1.8 billion of cash. Our September 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of disciplined share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.5 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $69 million of stock during the third quarter. As of the end of Q3, our share repurchase authorization is more than $1 billion. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and, combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect recent performance and trends. We increased the outlook for all 3 segments: Research, Conferences and Consulting. And our EBITDA guidance reflects Q3 upside and an increased outlook for Q4. As a reminder, about 1/3 of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we expect currency to be a modest benefit in Q4. Our updated 2024 guidance is as follows: we expect research revenue of at least $5.11 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. This reflects subscription research revenue growth of about 7%. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $580 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 15%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $535 million, which is a growth of about 5% FX-neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.225 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 6%. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.52 billion, up $60 million from our prior guidance. We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $11.75. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.35 billion. The increase from prior guidance reflects several items. First, improved operating performance; second, the insurance-related proceeds we received in August, net of estimated taxes; and third, a nonrecurring payment related to our ongoing real estate planning. The guidance reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of 126%. Our guidance is based on 78 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of the third quarter. Our financial results through September have been ahead of our plan despite continuing global macro uncertainty. CV grew high single digits in the quarter, and we believe the first quarter of 2024 was the bottom for CV growth in this cycle. We repurchased more than $630 million of stock year-to-date through September and remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Robert W. Baird.\nJeffrey Meuler: Can you just comment on GTS enterprise leader, I guess, end market conditions or pipeline? Just trying to triangulate from what you're giving us on tech vendor getting better as well as the 9% enterprise function with GBS growing 11.6%. It looks like it might have decelerated a little bit. So just any help on pipeline and anything beyond macro sales capacity, et cetera.\nEugene Hall: Jeff, it's Gene. So in terms of pipeline, we have a robust pipeline for GTS enterprise leaders. We have a very strong value proposition. We're on the issues that people really care about it. So our pipeline link is very strong. There's -- from time to time, there's some reconfiguration that goes on in terms of our sales force and any results in a particular quarter are influenced by the particular SKU of renewals that quarter and other things, but we're kind of uncontracted with where we expected. And again, we have just a great pipeline for GTS users.\nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then on expenses, is 2024 expected to be a good baseline to expand modestly from over time for adjusted EBITDA margins? Or could there be, I guess, more of a headwind as growth investment gets fully reinstated with you reaccelerating sales headcount.\nCraig Safian: So I think a couple of thoughts there. So one, '24 is a relatively good baseline from an operating expense perspective rolling forward. The only thing I would highlight is the growth in both GTS and GBS headcount that we're building into 2024 has been back-end loaded. And so obviously, we'll pay for that from a full year perspective next year. And then, as Gene mentioned in his prepared remarks, we intend to continue to grow our sales force to go after that huge untapped market opportunity into the future. So I think the way we sort of think about the OpEx base is where '24 is a relatively good baseline and safe for the back-end loading of our GTS and GBS headcount. And as we roll into 2025, we want to make sure that we continue to make those investments in GTS and GBS headcount and other key areas of the business to make sure that we drive strong retention rates, we drive productivity, and we drive sustained growth to the top line over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: I guess, at this point in the year, you're probably talking to a lot of clients on renewals. And so just wanted to hear if there's anything interesting that you're hearing from them about their '25 budgets and what your expectations are for the selling environment for next year?\nEugene Hall: Tony, we have renewals all year long. But if I look at what's going on right now and our client's '25 budgets, they're expecting a better year in '25 than in '24 right now, which, if that proceeds [indiscernible], that would be good for all of us. But right now, that's what we hear is that they're expecting '25 [indiscernible] better than '24.\nToni Kaplan: Great. And I was hoping you could give us an update on your sales force tenure. I know you've been working on a number of initiatives to retain and attract the best salespeople. Just wanted to hear how those initiatives are going and your retention relative to history? And are you where you want to be with regard to sales headcount? I know it's a continuous process, but just anything around the tenure and sales force attraction?\nEugene Hall: Yes. We have a fantastic value proposition for prospective salespeople as well as other associates for Gartner. So we have a very -- and if you think about -- when we hire people, we have on the order of 200 people apply for every job. And so we kind of get to pick from the best of the best in terms of who we hire, also because we have a very strong associate value proposition. Our associate turnover is very low. So our turnover has been lower, but the reason it's not [indiscernible] is because we're managing the bottom group to make sure that we're always upgrading our talent. And so again, we have a great associate value proposition that allows us to really attract great people. Our turnover is very low. It's in the range that we would like it to be in exactly. Any lower would be too low because we wouldn't be [indiscernible] enough performance management. And in terms of tenure, what that electric with is, our tenure has been slowly rising over time. And again, as Craig mentioned in his remarks, we accelerated higher -- and I mentioned as well, we've accelerated our investment so that puts some newer people in the sales force, but overall tenure has been rising.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Lakrits with Goldman Sachs.\nKeen Fai Tong: This is George Tong with Goldman. I guess with respect to tech vendor contract value, you mentioned that it's turned the corner and continues to accelerate. Can you talk about where the growth is currently now? And when you would expect the CV growth with tech vendors to more meaningfully improve in performance given prevailing trends?\nEugene Hall: So George, with tech vendor, what's going on is that with our new business, and in fact, Craig and I mentioned this, new business to tech vendors actually has rebounded pretty nicely, but we still have some tech vendors that are particularly small tech vendors that are financially challenged. They aren't doing that well and they can't get [indiscernible]. They may have a contract that's still in force. They may actually renew, but they're renewing at lower rates. And so what's dragging our growth down in our tech business right now is the fact that we have particularly very small vendors that can't get funding, but have contracts with us, could be 1-, 2- or even a 3-year contract that's coming up for renewal. And those are renewed at lower rates than we've seen historically. Eventually, that will go through. But again, I think a very positive sign is that our new business, our sales, both to existing clients and new logos for tech vendors has rebounded nicely and it's more in the range of historical levels.\nKeen Fai Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then with the consulting business, you mentioned the contract optimization piece at tough comps and growth can sometimes be variable. Can you talk a little bit more about the trends that drive this business and what you're seeing with the trends there or overall trends improving? And what would you expect going forward to be the key driver of performance with this part of the consulting business?\nEugene Hall: So in that business, we have a very strong value proposition, which is we help clients get better deals in terms of both pricing and terms on very large contracts. So if we have a client that's going to a very large CRM system or something like that, and they're spending -- the contracts there could be $50 million, $100 million, $500 million in terms of that we're helping clients get better deals on. So it's very strong value proposition. And our track record in helping the clients is very strong there. And so that's kind of the fundamentals of the business. Having said that, the business you can imagine, if you're doing $100 million deals, it's lumpy. It's not -- they don't all come in exactly on a week or something like that. It depends on what the clients' needs are, and also negotiations could take time. The actual client budget could change, they could decide they want to accelerate or push it off for 6 months. But it's more -- what drives that business is, first, our very strong value proposition. But then when we realize that value is very variable depending on -- we get paid when the clients actually signed the deal and so depending on the skew of how big the deals are and when they get signed is why our -- we have the very build in that business. So last year, it happened that there were an unusually large -- extremely large number of those kinds of deals in Q3. We had a great Q3, but it wasn't quite as strong as it was last year in that business. And it's just a matter of the kind of variability that I just went through.\nCraig Safian: And George, as order of magnitude, last year, reported growth rate in Q3 was 98%. So it was -- definitely meets the definition in my mind of very tough compare. And I think over the short term, medium term and long term, we expect this business to grow in line with our consulting medium-term objective as well. But from a quarter-to-quarter basis, as Gene outlined, and for all the reasons he Gene outlined, it can be very variable quarter to quarter to quarter. But it's a great business because it delivers a very strong value proposition for our clients.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nUnknown Analyst: This is Tom Rush on for Angie Nicolas. I wanted to focus on new business growth in the quarter across GTS and GBS. And I was wondering if you could unpack the underlying drivers there?\nCraig Safian: Yes. So Tom, as we say, the GBS new business growth was 10% year-over-year. So really good solid double-digit growth. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, pretty broad-based performance across all the GBS practices. On the GTS side, year-over-year new business growth was 8%. And again, strong high single-digit year-over-year growth. And again, it's sort of broad-based across the bulk of GTS. I think when we think about the drivers, it sort of goes back to the strength of the value proposition of our research offerings and making sure that our sellers are generating enough opportunities within the pipeline and then are leveraging all of our best practices to work those things through the pipeline and convert into sales. And we -- that's sort of the strategy, and we continue to turn the crank on that. I wouldn't say there's any big external driver or a demand driver or anything like that other than the value proposition continues to remain incredibly strong in the end markets that we serve.\nUnknown Analyst: Great. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to drill down on client spending more broadly in the quarter and just see how it trended relative to your expectations? And then any color you can add on [indiscernible] the fourth quarter?\nCraig Safian: Again, I wouldn't say we saw anything different from a client spending or an end market perspective. As both Gene and I mentioned earlier, the world continues to be a pretty complex and dynamic place, and we are working our way through that. Gene highlighted some of the the big topics that a lot of our clients are very focused on, but it's not exclusively those. The clients we serve have lots and lots and lots of challenges. And obviously, Gartner is a great way to address those challenges and improve operational performance for the executives that we support. So I think there's no big change from a client spending perspective or any external trend like that, more of the same. We're just focused on making sure that we're delivering value and continuing [indiscernible].\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with UBS.\nJoshua Chan: So last quarter, you suggested that the Q1 CV would be the bottom, but that the path of recovery may be uneven. I guess maybe taking a step back, what did you see that caused you to make that uneven comment? And as we stand here in Q3, what do you think about the pace going into Q4 in terms of CV?\nEugene Hall: So Josh, the -- if you look at our contract value, in any given quarter, there are certain set of renewals that come up. It varies from quarter-to-quarter. And if there's more renewals in a quarter than another or 1 slips a quarter, that's kind of what's responsible for kind of the quarter-to-quarter variation, which is why we have said the path to accelerating our growth isn't going to be necessarily the exact straight line. And so you just see the normal variation in terms of what renewals. A new business deal may get pushed in another quarter. Again, if you add these up with big deals, it actually is what is responsible for that. But overall, again, we have a very strong value proposition. We see great demand from our clients on the issues you'd expect, so like cybersecurity, how do they use artificial intelligence, data and analytics, cost optimization is always popular, and again, it's a rocky macroeconomic situation right now. And so contract optimization continues to be something very important to many of our clients. And so the kind of strong value post is the same. It's just kind of the specifics of what happens each quarter, it caused us a little variability.\nCraig Safian: And Josh, just to put it in sort of quick terms, with a roughly $5 billion base, a $3.5 million change in a quarter could be a 10-basis-point or at least reported around the 10-basis-point change. And so again, recognizing that the world is a very complex and dynamic place, deals may push, may come in early, et cetera, et cetera, and all the things Gene just highlighted, that's why we guided that it may not be a straight line from a trend perspective, it can be a little bit rocky. But again, we're talking about potentially as small as swings as $3.5 million could drive a 10-basis-point bump 1 way or the other.\nJoshua Chan: That's right. That's definitely understandable. And then maybe on GBS CV, I guess, that's still a very healthy level, but it continues to step down a little bit sequentially. Could you talk about what you expect there? Or what's going on in terms of GBS CV? And I don't know if sales and marketing practices have anything to do with that, but some comment on the trajectory there would be helpful.\nEugene Hall: Let me spend just on GBS CV. GBS CV, you can think about it at a very high level, there's 2 groups. There's kind of new products that we've introduced that we refer to as GxL and then some of our legacy products that we inherited primarily from CEB. And we still have still a lot of CV there. And if you look at the new products that we've introduced, the GxL products, they're actually growing above our 12% to 16%. They continue to grow above our 12% to 16% medium-term growth range. And so the deceleration is really in some of the legacy products. As the economy has gotten a little rougher, those that renewal that are renewing at somewhat lower rates than they've done historically. And that's kind of the biggest factor that's impacting the GBS growth rate. So the GBS kind of new business is extremely healthy, doing extremely well. And of course, we're managing the legacy products, but they're less attractive than they were. Each year, they get a little less attractive. So that's kind of the biggest drag that we have on GBS.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy: So you mentioned a few times that you're helping clients implement AI in the right places. I know historically, you've talked about AI sort of not being a big driver of CV growth generally. I'm curious if now that we're further along the AI journey, if you think that could be a more significant contributor to overall new business as we look ahead to '25 and beyond?\nEugene Hall: Great question. So we -- our clients always expect us to be helping with the most important issues they have. And so at one point in time, a few years ago, it might have been cloud computing. And so if you look today, the issues that are really cost are the ones I mentioned earlier, which is clients are wrestling with how do we use AI. They're wrestling with how do we maintain tight cybersecurity. The rest of it, how do we maintain and access all of our data, all the data and analytics that every business needs to use today, and like the cost optimization. And that's true across all the functions in the business. In addition, there's kind of the geopolitical factors that are making organizational changes that we help people with. And so the one thing our business is we're always in kind of the issues that are most important to clients. Those histories change over time, so it doesn't mean, for example, if there's a new issue that now AI is more important to cloud. It means that all of a sudden, we get a huge demand, we've been helping them all along with the most important issues. And so on the margin, it helps, of course, but it's a whole range of issues. And we always run the most important at the time.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. That's helpful. And then I was curious, as we think about revenues into 2025, I know we're still waiting on 4Q CV, and that will be a big driver, but curious if there's any sort of early read on 2025, maybe you can share some thoughts on research and nonsubscription revenue, where we saw some declines. Do you expect that business to grow? And maybe just additional color on -- in response to Toni's question around acceleration in CV next year?\nCraig Safian: So I think we'll obviously provide a full view on 2025 guidance in February as is our normal practice. You're right in highlighting that the biggest driver of 2025 revenue is where CV and CV growth finishes in 2024. And we've got -- we're 1 month through the fourth quarter, and there's still a lot of deals that we are working. It's a very, very, very large quarter for us. And so where the dust settles on that will be the biggest driver around 2025. And then -- around 2025 revenue, I should say, more specifically. And then as we think about the business, we continue to believe and have great conviction behind the fact that we will get both GTS and GBS back to 12% to 16% growth over the medium term, and we expect to accelerate to those points over time. 2025 is a part of that time for sure. but we'll provide full guidance around 2025 as we normally do. I\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Craig, maybe just a follow up on that. Can you just remind us how big the fourth quarter is in terms of the percentage of renewals and maybe sales that are typically weighted towards that quarter?\nCraig Safian: The way to think about it and you kind of look back at historical numbers, we generate order of magnitude around half of our NCVI, which is the numerator for overall CV growth in the fourth quarter, and we generate order of magnitude about 40% of our annual new business in the fourth quarter. The one thing I would say is that we're not generally overloaded with renewals in the fourth quarter. Our teams do a really good job of when there's an opportunity to pull forward, we do that. And again, remember, we're also writing lots of multiyear deals when we sell them as well. But roughly 50% of NCVI happens in the fourth quarter, again, roughly, and about 40% of new business.\nManav Patnaik: It. That's helpful. And Gene, just on the hiring, the quota-bearing headcount strategy, you talked about better budget expectations in talking to your customers. The pipeline is robust. I think you said 200 applicants per job posting. Historically, I think you've always being in the camp of hiring aggressively even when things were costly ready for the rebound. So just curious why mid-single digits by year-end is the strategy today versus a bigger number to be ready for the rebound?\nEugene Hall: Manav, The reason that our hiring plans are based on what we think is where the market is, which we think is in a good place. That's why we're accelerating our hiring, but also it's based on our operational capability to make sure we bring on really good people and then we train and develop those people. And so it makes more sense for us to kind of accelerate that hiring as opposed to make a step change where I'm concerned about our operational ability to be as effective as we would be as compared to a kind of more streamline acceleration.\nOperator: Out next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies LLC.\nSurinder Thind: Gene, just following up on the last question there. As you structurally think about the sales force and the size of the sales force, just any color on the potential impact on longer-term metrics, maybe around how you're viewing productivity the number of clients that maybe each salesperson can handle. Does AI change any of that? Or do you have any data points as you think about structurally, not this year or next year, but as we maybe think a little bit longer term about the sales force?\nEugene Hall: Yes. I mentioned in my comments that we have some prototypes that we're using that are very promising. I think it's too early to say what the long-term productivity impact will be. I think it will be positive, but whether it's 2% or 5% or whatever, I couldn't really say right now. I know our associates like it and it's working really well. We'll see over time as we realize what the real benefit is. It's not going to be like a [ 50 ]. I don't expect it's going to be like a 50% improvement in productivity or something like that. It will be modest improvements over a period of time.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then in terms of the GBS side, I think you mentioned there are some areas where you're seeing some strength, such as finance, legal, HR, those kinds of areas. But then you also talked about maybe some more tepid demand on the sales and marketing side. Just any additional color there? Is that just kind of the maladies that we're seeing in terms of end client demand and the hiring in that area at the clients themselves? Or how should we think about the headwinds that we're seeing there in the near term?\nEugene Hall: So in marketing and sales, there's a couple of things [indiscernible]. First, there's an overweight for tech. And so while most of GBS split kind of with GDP, it turns out that in marketing sales were a little overweighted on the tech side is so they're being impacted by the tech piece in a way that the world GBS isn't. Second piece is there's actually -- relative to the amount of CD, there's a relatively high amount of legacy CV that I talked about earlier, where the new products are doing much -- doing quite well, but the legacy CV isn't doing as well. There's a higher proportion of legacy CV in the marketing sales piece. And the last piece is that, with marketing in particular, but sales to an extent, when economic times are tough, there's a lot more [indiscernible] on hiring in marketing and marketing spending than we are in some areas of the business. So all those things are coming together and make it more challenging in that [indiscernible]. It's still doing very well. So I wouldn't take away that it's shrinking or not doing well. We're actually happy with where it's going, but it does have those challenges that some of the other practices don't have as much of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeffrey Silber: Wonder if we can get some comments on the renewal process in terms of pricing, what types of price increases you've been able to get through and what we should be expecting for next year as well?\nCraig Safian: Jeff, thanks for that question. From a renewal perspective and from a pricing perspective, as you know, our #1 strategy there is to make sure that, at a minimum, we are offsetting our projected wage inflation with our price increases. And our -- the majority of our price action actually happens in November 1. And again, we we took up our pricing a little less than 4% this year to sort of match how we were thinking about wage inflation rolling into 2025. Generally speaking, we've ranged between 3% and 4% price increases for 15-plus years, save for a few exceptional years where there was higher wage inflation or lower, but most recently, higher weight inflation when we had to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing. But things have settled down a bit now. And so rolling into 2025, we're shade under 4% in terms of the structural price increase.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay. That's really helpful. If I could shift gears to consulting, you saw a decrease in gross margins on a year-over-year basis. Does that have anything to do with the mix shift away from the big contract optimization quarter you had last year? Or is there something else going on that we should be aware of?\nCraig Safian: Yes. The biggest thing there is what you highlighted, Jeff. Those deals are profitable for us. And we had a huge quarter in the year ago quarter, as we talked about. We had a very strong quarter this quarter, but down. And that's the biggest driver on the consulting contribution margin.\nOperator: our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo.\nJason Haas: I'm curious if you could talk about what you're expecting for non-subscription revenue this year. In the last call, you talked about $305 million. And I think there were some comments on this call that it would be similar [indiscernible] that's still the expectation. And the reason I ask is because it does seem to imply pretty substantial decline in 4Q, but the compares do get a lot easier. So I'm just curious if I have that right. And then maybe how you're thinking about that nonsubscription revenue going forward?\nCraig Safian: Jason, thank you for that question. On the nonsub side, we are still expecting about $305 million for that revenue for 2024. So unchanged from our perspective last quarter. You're right, the math does imply a pretty significant year-over-year decrease, a little bit more than what we've been seeing. But again, we delivered on roughly our expectation in the third quarter and so the full year was basically unchanged.\nJason Haas: Got it. That's helpful. And then I'm not sure if you could talk about expectations if that -- if we'll continue to see declines into next year? And I also want to have a follow-up question on just the time it takes for your sales force to ramp up. So I recognize you'll be growing quarter-bearing headcount by year-end mid- to high single digits. How long does it take those folks to get ramped up to a more normal level of productivity?\nCraig Safian: Yes, sure. I'll cover the 2025 expectations will be very short. And then Gene can talk about the the sales force ramp up. So again, as is our practice, we'll provide full guidance on everything in February. And so we're not in a position where we're talking about 2025 yet. There's still a lot to go in 2024, which obviously influences how we're going to set our plans and targets for 2025 and then, Gene, on sales force ramp.\nEugene Hall: Yes. In terms of sales force productivity, ramp, it takes 3 years for a salesperson to get from -- to full productivity. So the people we're hiring now will get to full productivity 3 years from now. So this is an investment not just for 2025, but for '26 and '27 as well. And we've seen that pretty consistently over time. We're very focused on moving that productivity earlier so that it doesn't take 3 years or at least we get more of that productivity early on. And so a bunch of things I talked about like the apprenticeship program, the training, et cetera, the tools that we're giving our -- equipping our sales force with are designed to get our new salespeople up that brand faster. But currently takes about 3 years digital productivity.\nOperator: And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Gene Hall for closing remarks.\nEugene Hall: So here's what I'd like you take away from today's call. Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations. We delivered 9% contract value growth of enterprise function leaders. Tech vendor seating growth has turned the corner and continues to accelerate. We have a vast addressable market opportunity with a strong and compelling client value proposition. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to drive sustained double-digit revenue growth over the long term. We'll continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actual objective impacts for our clients, prudently invested for future growth, gunning free cash flow well in excess of net income and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eugene Hall",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner continues to remain resilient in a complex environment. In Q3, contract value grew high single digits. Financial results for the third quarter were ahead of expectations. We raised our 2024 guidance for revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow. Leaders in every enterprise continue to face more simultaneous disruptions than ever before. Gartner is the best source for actionable objective insight to drive smart decisions and stronger performance on an organization's mission-critical priorities. A powerful way to experience our research insights is to attend a Gartner Conference. At the start of every conference, our analysts deliver a thought-provoking keynote on a critically important topic. I recently attended Gartner's IT Symposium Expo in Orlando, Florida. In the opening keynote, our analysts inspired thousands of CIOs and IT executives. They showed these leaders how to implement AI in the right places at the right pace for their environments. The keynote received among the highest ratings ever. Gartner delivers unparalleled value at the intersection of business and technology. We help our clients manage risk, save time, save money and build confidence. We got clients through a wide range of topics. For example, cybersecurity, strategic workforce planning, cost optimization and leveraging generative AI across multiple disciplines, including procurement, brand management and sales enablement. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our research business source leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry and every geography, and our market opportunity is vast. Within our research business, contract value with enterprise function leaders grew 9%. And contract value with tech vendor clients continued the improvement we saw last quarter. We serve executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. Contract value was 6%, GTS new business growth was 8%. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, legal, sales and more. GBS new business growth was 10% and contract value grew 12%. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. Revenue grew 30% in the third quarter, and we're off to a great start in Q4. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting [indiscernible] execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Labor-based consulting revenue grew 2%. Contract optimization revenue met our expectations. Our road to success has been driven by relentless execution of Gartner best practices. We continuously improve and innovate across our business. I'll share a few examples. First, we deployed a state-of-the-art CRM system across most of our business. Now our teams have greater visibility to better serve our clients. We also added innovations to our phased approach to sales training, which positively impact sales productivity for new hires. One way we capture our large untapped market opportunity is by growing sales headcount. We accelerated hiring in the second half of 2024, and expect to continue growing our sales force into 2025 and beyond. Another example of improvement is with [indiscernible] salespeople. We're growing and refining our [indiscernible] type program that lets early career salespeople gain valuable experience before they take on direct [indiscernible] roles. And we're leveraging AI internally. We've built prototypes that our associates are using to match our vast library of powerful insights to each client situation. And those are just a few examples. Developing creates best practices and executing them consistently is a core part of our strategy. In closing, Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations. We delivered 9% contract value growth with enterprise function leaders. Tech vendor CV growth has turned the corner and continues to accelerate. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We'll continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actionable objective insight to our clients, [indiscernible] investing for future growth and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. We expect to deliver modest margin expansion over time and will continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. All of this and more positions us to continue our sustained track record of success far in the future. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Jeff, it's Gene. So in terms of pipeline, we have a robust pipeline for GTS enterprise leaders. We have a very strong value proposition. We're on the issues that people really care about it. So our pipeline link is very strong. There's -- from time to time, there's some reconfiguration that goes on in terms of our sales force and any results in a particular quarter are influenced by the particular SKU of renewals that quarter and other things, but we're kind of uncontracted with where we expected. And again, we have just a great pipeline for GTS users. Tony, we have renewals all year long. But if I look at what's going on right now and our client's '25 budgets, they're expecting a better year in '25 than in '24 right now, which, if that proceeds [indiscernible], that would be good for all of us. But right now, that's what we hear is that they're expecting '25 [indiscernible] better than '24. Yes. We have a fantastic value proposition for prospective salespeople as well as other associates for Gartner. So we have a very -- and if you think about -- when we hire people, we have on the order of 200 people apply for every job. And so we kind of get to pick from the best of the best in terms of who we hire, also because we have a very strong associate value proposition. Our associate turnover is very low. So our turnover has been lower, but the reason it's not [indiscernible] is because we're managing the bottom group to make sure that we're always upgrading our talent. And so again, we have a great associate value proposition that allows us to really attract great people. Our turnover is very low. It's in the range that we would like it to be in exactly. Any lower would be too low because we wouldn't be [indiscernible] enough performance management. And in terms of tenure, what that electric with is, our tenure has been slowly rising over time. And again, as Craig mentioned in his remarks, we accelerated higher -- and I mentioned as well, we've accelerated our investment so that puts some newer people in the sales force, but overall tenure has been rising. So George, with tech vendor, what's going on is that with our new business, and in fact, Craig and I mentioned this, new business to tech vendors actually has rebounded pretty nicely, but we still have some tech vendors that are particularly small tech vendors that are financially challenged. They aren't doing that well and they can't get [indiscernible]. They may have a contract that's still in force. They may actually renew, but they're renewing at lower rates. And so what's dragging our growth down in our tech business right now is the fact that we have particularly very small vendors that can't get funding, but have contracts with us, could be 1-, 2- or even a 3-year contract that's coming up for renewal. And those are renewed at lower rates than we've seen historically. Eventually, that will go through. But again, I think a very positive sign is that our new business, our sales, both to existing clients and new logos for tech vendors has rebounded nicely and it's more in the range of historical levels. So in that business, we have a very strong value proposition, which is we help clients get better deals in terms of both pricing and terms on very large contracts. So if we have a client that's going to a very large CRM system or something like that, and they're spending -- the contracts there could be $50 million, $100 million, $500 million in terms of that we're helping clients get better deals on. So it's very strong value proposition. And our track record in helping the clients is very strong there. And so that's kind of the fundamentals of the business. Having said that, the business you can imagine, if you're doing $100 million deals, it's lumpy. It's not -- they don't all come in exactly on a week or something like that. It depends on what the clients' needs are, and also negotiations could take time. The actual client budget could change, they could decide they want to accelerate or push it off for 6 months. But it's more -- what drives that business is, first, our very strong value proposition. But then when we realize that value is very variable depending on -- we get paid when the clients actually signed the deal and so depending on the skew of how big the deals are and when they get signed is why our -- we have the very build in that business. So last year, it happened that there were an unusually large -- extremely large number of those kinds of deals in Q3. We had a great Q3, but it wasn't quite as strong as it was last year in that business. And it's just a matter of the kind of variability that I just went through. So Josh, the -- if you look at our contract value, in any given quarter, there are certain set of renewals that come up. It varies from quarter-to-quarter. And if there's more renewals in a quarter than another or 1 slips a quarter, that's kind of what's responsible for kind of the quarter-to-quarter variation, which is why we have said the path to accelerating our growth isn't going to be necessarily the exact straight line. And so you just see the normal variation in terms of what renewals. A new business deal may get pushed in another quarter. Again, if you add these up with big deals, it actually is what is responsible for that. But overall, again, we have a very strong value proposition. We see great demand from our clients on the issues you'd expect, so like cybersecurity, how do they use artificial intelligence, data and analytics, cost optimization is always popular, and again, it's a rocky macroeconomic situation right now. And so contract optimization continues to be something very important to many of our clients. And so the kind of strong value post is the same. It's just kind of the specifics of what happens each quarter, it caused us a little variability. Let me spend just on GBS CV. GBS CV, you can think about it at a very high level, there's 2 groups. There's kind of new products that we've introduced that we refer to as GxL and then some of our legacy products that we inherited primarily from CEB. And we still have still a lot of CV there. And if you look at the new products that we've introduced, the GxL products, they're actually growing above our 12% to 16%. They continue to grow above our 12% to 16% medium-term growth range. And so the deceleration is really in some of the legacy products. As the economy has gotten a little rougher, those that renewal that are renewing at somewhat lower rates than they've done historically. And that's kind of the biggest factor that's impacting the GBS growth rate. So the GBS kind of new business is extremely healthy, doing extremely well. And of course, we're managing the legacy products, but they're less attractive than they were. Each year, they get a little less attractive. So that's kind of the biggest drag that we have on GBS. Great question. So we -- our clients always expect us to be helping with the most important issues they have. And so at one point in time, a few years ago, it might have been cloud computing. And so if you look today, the issues that are really cost are the ones I mentioned earlier, which is clients are wrestling with how do we use AI. They're wrestling with how do we maintain tight cybersecurity. The rest of it, how do we maintain and access all of our data, all the data and analytics that every business needs to use today, and like the cost optimization.

And so it makes more sense for us to kind of accelerate that hiring as opposed to make a step change where I'm concerned about our operational ability to be as effective as we would be as compared to a kind of more streamline acceleration. Yes. I mentioned in my comments that we have some prototypes that we're using that are very promising. I think it's too early to say what the long-term productivity impact will be. I think it will be positive, but whether it's 2% or 5% or whatever, I couldn't really say right now. I know our associates like it and it's working really well. We'll see over time as we realize what the real benefit is. It's not going to be like a [ 50 ]. I don't expect it's going to be like a 50% improvement in productivity or something like that. It will be modest improvements over a period of time. So in marketing and sales, there's a couple of things [indiscernible]. First, there's an overweight for tech.

We're actually happy with where it's going, but it does have those challenges that some of the other practices don't have as much of. Yes. In terms of sales force productivity, ramp, it takes 3 years for a salesperson to get from -- to full productivity. So the people we're hiring now will get to full productivity 3 years from now.

            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Third quarter contract value grew 7% year-over-year, another good performance in a still complex environment. Third quarter revenue, EBITDA and EPS all came in ahead of our expectations. We are updating our guidance based on the Q3 results and an improved outlook for the fourth quarter. Also during the third quarter, we received $300 million before taxes related to conference cancellation insurance for the conferences affected by the pandemic. We have repurchased more than $630 million of stock through September and remain eager to repurchase shares opportunistically. Third quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and 6% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, consistent with last year. EBITDA was $340 million, up 2% as reported and 3% FX neutral versus the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EPS was $2.50 compared with $2.56 in Q3 of last year. And free cash flow, including the insurance-related proceeds, was $565 million. Research revenue in the third quarter grew 5% year-over-year as reported and FX neutral. Subscription revenue grew 7% FX neutral. Nonsubscription research revenue was in line with our expectations. Third quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with last year. Contract value was $5 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 7% versus the prior year and up about $104 million from the second quarter. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew 9%. Contract value and CV growth are FX neutral. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Tech vendor contract value has turned a corner with strong new business and continued contract value acceleration in Q3. Across our combined practices, half of the industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates, led by the energy, health care and manufacturing sectors. CV grew at high single-digit rates across all enterprise sizes except small, which grew low single digits and has the largest tech vendor mix. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.9 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 6% versus the prior year. GTS enterprise leader CV increased high single digits. Tech vendor CV growth improved from Q2 as the positive shift, which began last quarter, continued. GTS CV increased $67 million from the second quarter, while retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, similar to Q2. Enterprise leader wallet retention was consistent with historical levels. GTS new business was up 8% compared to last year. CTS quota-bearing head count was up 1% year-over-year. We added more than 90 sellers in the quarter, the largest sequential increase since Q4 of 2022. This sets us up to deliver on mid-single-digit QBH growth for GTS by the end of the year. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $1.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 12% year-over-year. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit rates other than marketing and sales, which grew mid-single digits. Growth was led by the finance, legal and supply chain practices. GBS CV increased $37 million from the second quarter. While retention for GBS was 106% for the quarter, which compares to 108% in the prior year, GBS new business was up 10% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing head count was up 8% year-over-year, and we continue to target high single-digit growth for 2024. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the third quarter was $76 million, increasing 32% as reported and 30% FX neutral compared to Q3 of 2023. Contribution margin was 40%, consistent with typical Q3 seasonality. We held 10 destination conferences in the third quarter. Third quarter consulting revenue was $128 million compared with $133 million in the year ago period. Consulting contribution margin was 33% in the third quarter. Labor-based revenue was $101 million, up 2% versus Q3 of last year as reported and FX neutral. Backlog at September 30 was $218 million, increasing 21% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength. In contract optimization, we delivered $26 million of revenue in the quarter with a very tough compare from Q3 of last year. Our contract optimization revenue is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services increased 5% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and FX neutral. The biggest driver of the increase was higher compensation costs. SG&A increased 8% year-over-year in the third quarter as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth, which contributed to higher compensation costs. EBITDA for the third quarter was $340 million, up 2% from last year as reported and up 3% FX neutral. We outperformed in the third quarter through revenue upside, effective expense management and a prudent approach to guidance. Depreciation in the quarter of $29 million was up 18% compared to 2023. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $17 million. This is favorable by $4 million versus the third quarter of 2023 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through the third quarter of 2025. The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 26% for the quarter. This compares to last year's rate of 22%. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 17% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.5 compared with $2.56 last year. We had 78 million shares outstanding in the third quarter. This is an improvement of close to 1.6 million shares or about 2% year-over-year. We exited the third quarter with about 78 million shares on an unweighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $591 million compared with $331 million in Q3 of 2023. This includes $300 million of insurance-related proceeds we received in the quarter. We expect to pay the associated taxes during Q4. CapEx for the quarter was $26 million, in line with our expectations. Free cash flow for the quarter was $565 million, including the insurance-related proceeds. Free cash flow on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 119% of GAAP net income. Excluding the insurance-related proceeds, free cash flow was 16% of revenue and 63% of EBITDA. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. At the end of the third quarter, we had about $1.8 billion of cash. Our September 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of disciplined share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $2.5 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $69 million of stock during the third quarter. As of the end of Q3, our share repurchase authorization is more than $1 billion. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and, combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect recent performance and trends. We increased the outlook for all 3 segments: Research, Conferences and Consulting. And our EBITDA guidance reflects Q3 upside and an increased outlook for Q4. As a reminder, about 1/3 of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we expect currency to be a modest benefit in Q4. Our updated 2024 guidance is as follows: we expect research revenue of at least $5.11 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. This reflects subscription research revenue growth of about 7%. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $580 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 15%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $535 million, which is a growth of about 5% FX-neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.225 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 6%. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.52 billion, up $60 million from our prior guidance. We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $11.75. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.35 billion. The increase from prior guidance reflects several items. First, improved operating performance; second, the insurance-related proceeds we received in August, net of estimated taxes; and third, a nonrecurring payment related to our ongoing real estate planning. The guidance reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of 126%. Our guidance is based on 78 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of the third quarter. Our financial results through September have been ahead of our plan despite continuing global macro uncertainty. CV grew high single digits in the quarter, and we believe the first quarter of 2024 was the bottom for CV growth in this cycle. We repurchased more than $630 million of stock year-to-date through September and remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? So I think a couple of thoughts there. So one, '24 is a relatively good baseline from an operating expense perspective rolling forward. The only thing I would highlight is the growth in both GTS and GBS headcount that we're building into 2024 has been back-end loaded. And so obviously, we'll pay for that from a full year perspective next year. And then, as Gene mentioned in his prepared remarks, we intend to continue to grow our sales force to go after that huge untapped market opportunity into the future. So I think the way we sort of think about the OpEx base is where '24 is a relatively good baseline and safe for the back-end loading of our GTS and GBS headcount. And as we roll into 2025, we want to make sure that we continue to make those investments in GTS and GBS headcount and other key areas of the business to make sure that we drive strong retention rates, we drive productivity, and we drive sustained growth to the top line over time. And George, as order of magnitude, last year, reported growth rate in Q3 was 98%. So it was -- definitely meets the definition in my mind of very tough compare. And I think over the short term, medium term and long term, we expect this business to grow in line with our consulting medium-term objective as well. But from a quarter-to-quarter basis, as Gene outlined, and for all the reasons he Gene outlined, it can be very variable quarter to quarter to quarter. But it's a great business because it delivers a very strong value proposition for our clients. Yes. So Tom, as we say, the GBS new business growth was 10% year-over-year. So really good solid double-digit growth. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, pretty broad-based performance across all the GBS practices. On the GTS side, year-over-year new business growth was 8%. And again, strong high single-digit year-over-year growth. And again, it's sort of broad-based across the bulk of GTS. I think when we think about the drivers, it sort of goes back to the strength of the value proposition of our research offerings and making sure that our sellers are generating enough opportunities within the pipeline and then are leveraging all of our best practices to work those things through the pipeline and convert into sales. And we -- that's sort of the strategy, and we continue to turn the crank on that. I wouldn't say there's any big external driver or a demand driver or anything like that other than the value proposition continues to remain incredibly strong in the end markets that we serve. Again, I wouldn't say we saw anything different from a client spending or an end market perspective. As both Gene and I mentioned earlier, the world continues to be a pretty complex and dynamic place, and we are working our way through that. Gene highlighted some of the the big topics that a lot of our clients are very focused on, but it's not exclusively those. The clients we serve have lots and lots and lots of challenges. And obviously, Gartner is a great way to address those challenges and improve operational performance for the executives that we support. So I think there's no big change from a client spending perspective or any external trend like that, more of the same. We're just focused on making sure that we're delivering value and continuing [indiscernible]. And Josh, just to put it in sort of quick terms, with a roughly $5 billion base, a $3.5 million change in a quarter could be a 10-basis-point or at least reported around the 10-basis-point change. And so again, recognizing that the world is a very complex and dynamic place, deals may push, may come in early, et cetera, et cetera, and all the things Gene just highlighted, that's why we guided that it may not be a straight line from a trend perspective, it can be a little bit rocky. But again, we're talking about potentially as small as swings as $3.5 million could drive a 10-basis-point bump 1 way or the other. So I think we'll obviously provide a full view on 2025 guidance in February as is our normal practice. You're right in highlighting that the biggest driver of 2025 revenue is where CV and CV growth finishes in 2024. And we've got -- we're 1 month through the fourth quarter, and there's still a lot of deals that we are working. It's a very, very, very large quarter for us. And so where the dust settles on that will be the biggest driver around 2025. And then -- around 2025 revenue, I should say, more specifically. And then as we think about the business, we continue to believe and have great conviction behind the fact that we will get both GTS and GBS back to 12% to 16% growth over the medium term, and we expect to accelerate to those points over time. 2025 is a part of that time for sure. but we'll provide full guidance around 2025 as we normally do. I The way to think about it and you kind of look back at historical numbers, we generate order of magnitude around half of our NCVI, which is the numerator for overall CV growth in the fourth quarter, and we generate order of magnitude about 40% of our annual new business in the fourth quarter. The one thing I would say is that we're not generally overloaded with renewals in the fourth quarter. Our teams do a really good job of when there's an opportunity to pull forward, we do that. And again, remember, we're also writing lots of multiyear deals when we sell them as well. But roughly 50% of NCVI happens in the fourth quarter, again, roughly, and about 40% of new business. Jeff, thanks for that question. From a renewal perspective and from a pricing perspective, as you know, our #1 strategy there is to make sure that, at a minimum, we are offsetting our projected wage inflation with our price increases. And our -- the majority of our price action actually happens in November 1. And again, we we took up our pricing a little less than 4% this year to sort of match how we were thinking about wage inflation rolling into 2025. Generally speaking, we've ranged between 3% and 4% price increases for 15-plus years, save for a few exceptional years where there was higher wage inflation or lower, but most recently, higher weight inflation when we had to be a little bit more aggressive on pricing. But things have settled down a bit now. And so rolling into 2025, we're shade under 4% in terms of the structural price increase. Yes. The biggest thing there is what you highlighted, Jeff. Those deals are profitable for us. And we had a huge quarter in the year ago quarter, as we talked about. We had a very strong quarter this quarter, but down. And that's the biggest driver on the consulting contribution margin. Jason, thank you for that question. On the nonsub side, we are still expecting about $305 million for that revenue for 2024. So unchanged from our perspective last quarter. You're right, the math does imply a pretty significant year-over-year decrease, a little bit more than what we've been seeing. But again, we delivered on roughly our expectation in the third quarter and so the full year was basically unchanged. Yes, sure. I'll cover the 2025 expectations will be very short. And then Gene can talk about the the sales force ramp up. So again, as is our practice, we'll provide full guidance on everything in February. And so we're not in a position where we're talking about 2025 yet. There's still a lot to go in 2024, which obviously influences how we're going to set our plans and targets for 2025 and then, Gene, on sales force ramp."

Now, I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall.\nGene Hall: Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner remains resilient in a complex environment. In Q2, contract value grew high-single digits. Financial results for the second quarter were ahead of expectations, and we delivered strong profitability and free cash flow. The external environment remains volatile uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Leaders across every enterprise faced more simultaneous challenges than ever before. For example, small technology companies continue to face funding challenges. Supply chain shifts are impacting many industries. The banking industry continues to deal with higher interest rates. There are budget challenges in the public sector, persistent several threats, the potential impacts of generative AI. The list goes on. Enterprise leaders and their teams know they need help, and they know Gartner is the best source for the actionable objective insight, they need to drive smarter decisions and achieve stronger performance on their mission-critical priorities. Our value proposition helps our clients to save time, save money, gain confidence, manage risk, develop leadership skills, enhance their teams and achieve success. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our search business serves leaders across all of enterprise functions in every industry and in every geography. Our market opportunity is vast. Within our research business, contract value with enterprise function leaders grew 10%, and our tech vendor clients returned to growth. We continue to guide clients through a wide range of topics, including generative AI, supply chain optimization, leader and manager development, cost optimization, cybersecurity and the recent CrowdStrike outage. Through relentless execution of proven practices, we deliver unparalleled value, whether our clients are thriving, struggling, anywhere in between. Our research business serves executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS new business grew 8%. Contract value grew 6%. Contract value with GTS enterprise function leaders grew high single digits. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, lean, legal, sales and more. GBS new business grew 16%. GBS contract value grew 12%. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. Revenue grew 11% in the second quarter, and the outlook for conferences remains strong. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 15%. People are at the heart of everything we do. We get better, faster, stronger every year because we work effectively as one team to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. And our teams are committed to driving relentless execution of the best practices that will fuel long-term sustained double-digit growth. In closing, Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations. We delivered 10% contract value growth with enterprise function leaders. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We'll continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actionable objective insight to our clients, prudently investing for future growth and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. We expect to deliver modest margin expansion over time, and we'll continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. All of this and more positions us to continue our sustained track record of success far into the future. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian.\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter contract value grew 7% year-over-year, accelerating about 50 basis points from Q1. We believe the first quarter marked the bottom for CV growth this cycle, barring a meaningful shift in the macro or geopolitical environment. Growth may vary from quarter-to-quarter, but we expect the overall trend will be higher from the 6.9% we delivered in the first quarter. Over the medium term, we expect both GTS and GBS to grow 12% to 16%. Second quarter revenue, EBITDA and EPS all came in ahead of our expectations. We are updating our guidance based on the Q2 results, FX and a change in non-subscription research revenue. We have repurchased $565 million of stock through June and remain eager to buy back stock opportunistically. Second quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year as reported and 7% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, about in line with last year. EBITDA was $416 million, up 8% as reported and 10% FX neutral versus second quarter 2023. Adjusted EPS was $3.22, up 13% from Q2 of last year, and free cash flow was $341 million. Research revenue in the second quarter grew 5% year-over-year as reported and 6% on an FX-neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 7% FX neutral. The year-over-year change in non-subscription revenue was similar to Q1 2024. Second quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with last year. Contract value was $4.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% versus the prior year and up about $67 million from the first quarter. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew 10%. Contract value and CV growth are FX neutral. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates led by the energy, manufacturing and public sectors. CV grew double-digit or high single-digit rates across all enterprise sizes, except small, which has the largest tech vendor mix. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.8 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 6% versus the prior year. GTS enterprise leader CV increased high single digits. Tech vendor CV returned to growth in the quarter. GTS CV increased $40 million from the first quarter. While retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, up from Q1, enterprise leader wallet retention was consistent with historical levels. GTS new business was up 8% compared to last year. GTS quota-bearing head count was down 2% year-over-year as we manage tech vendor-focused sales territories in response to near-term industry dynamics. Across GTS, we continue to aggressively optimize our territories to align with where we have the best growth opportunities, and we are investing for future growth. We continue to expect mid-single-digit QBH growth by the end of the year. We have the headcount we need to meet commitments for this year. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 12% year-over-year. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates other than marketing, which grew mid-single digits. Growth was led by the finance, legal and supply chain practices. GBS CV increased $27 million from the first quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 106% for the quarter, which compares to 109% in the prior year. GBS new business was up 16% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing head count was up 6% year-over-year, and we continue to target high single-digit growth for 2024. As with GTS, a regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $186 million, increasing 10% as reported and 11% FX neutral compared to Q2 of 2023. Adjusting for the movement of conferences across the year, revenue increased about 15% in the quarter. Contribution margin was 58%. Q2 is our seasonally strongest margin quarter of the year. We held 16 destination conferences. Second quarter consulting revenue increased by 13% year-over-year to $143 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenue was up 15%. Consulting contribution margin was 38% in the second quarter. Labor-based revenue was $107 million, up 3% versus Q2 of last year's reported and 5% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at June 30 was $199 million, increasing 16% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength. In contract optimization, we delivered $36 million of revenue in the quarter, up 62% versus the prior year. Our contract optimization business is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services increased 5% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 6% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher compensation costs. SG&A increased 5% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and on a FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth, which contributed to higher compensation costs. EBITDA for the second quarter was $416 million, up 8% from last year's reported and up 10% FX neutral. We have performed in the second quarter through effective expense management and a prudent approach to guidance. Depreciation in the quarter of $28 million was up 16% compared to 2023. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $19 million. This is favorable by $4 million versus second quarter of 2023 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate that we have is fully hedged through the third quarter of 2025. The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 24% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $3.22, up 13% compared with last year. We had 78 million shares outstanding in the second quarter. This is a reduction of more than 1.5 million shares or about 2% year-over-year. We exited the second quarter with about 78 million shares on an unweighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $370 million compared with $436 million in Q2 of 2023. The change reflects working capital timing, which we expect to reverse in the second half. CapEx for the quarter was $29 million, in line with our expectations. Free cash flow for the quarter was $341 million. Free cash flow on a rolling four-quarter basis was 17% of revenue and 66% of EBITDA. Free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 121%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. At the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our June 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.9 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $340 million of our stock during the second quarter. We have more than $1 billion of repurchase capacity after the Board recently increased our share buyback authorization by $600 million. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect recent performance and trends. The outlook for subscription research is higher based on the latest FX rates. We increased the outlook for conferences and consulting. And our EBITDA guidance primarily reflects Q2 upside, partially offset by our updated non-subscription research outlook. For subscription research, which was about 76% of revenue in 2023, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. The executive and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. For subscription research revenue, based on Q2 results and our outlook for the balance of the year, our FX-neutral guidance is unchanged. We have very high visibility into the subscription research revenue at this point in the year. For non-subscription research, which was about 6% of 2023 revenue, we help small businesses find the right software. We've updated our outlook for this portion of the segment given the most recent trends. We now expect non-subscription revenue of about $305 million for 2024. As a reminder, about 1/3 of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we expect currency to be roughly neutral in the back half of the year with a modest benefit in Q4. Our updated 2024 guidance is as follows. We expect research revenue of at least $5.105 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. This reflects subscription research revenue growth of about 7%. We expect conferences revenue of at least $565 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 12%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $530 million, which is growth of about 4% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.2 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 5%. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.460 billion, up $5 million from our prior guidance. We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $11.05. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.08 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. This reflects the conversion from GAAP net income of 138%. After the second quarter ended, we reached the settlement related to pandemic or event cancellation insurance. We expect pretax proceeds of $300 million during the third quarter. This is not yet included in the cash flow or GAAP EPS guidance. Our guidance is based on 78 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of June. And finally, for the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $295 million. Our financial results through the first half have been ahead of our plan despite continuing global macro uncertainty. CV grew high single digits in the quarter, and we believe Q1 was the bottom for CV growth in this cycle. We repurchased $565 million in stock year-to-date through June and remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we've delivered double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time, and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And it's from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please proceed.\nJeff Meuler: When you\u2019ve kind of reiterated that you think Q1 marked the bottom for CV growth with the macro and geopolitical caveats, you said growth may vary quarter-to-quarter. Just want to, I guess, zooming on what you're trying to signal there. Is that just an acknowledgment of, I guess, the volatile end market environment? Or are you expecting that you expect deceleration at some point in the near future because of like a known year-over-year comp issue or anything else that you're seeing?\nCraig Safian: So, I'd say it's definitely more about the fact that operating in a very volatile operating environment and 10 basis points up or down is a relatively simple amount of CV in any given quarter. I think the core message is 6.9 marks the bottom, and we should be above that in every quarter moving forward, it could bounce around a little bit, and ultimately, our medium-term objective is to get both GTS and GBS back to 12% to 16% annual growth rates.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. And then on the building headcount from here, I guess, the tech vendor territory, I don't know exactly the phrase you use, but I don't know if it's just dynamic territory planning. But was that something that you recently kind of like kicked into gear? Or was that an ongoing dynamic? Just not sure what you're trying to signal there. And is it reassigning salespeople or just managing those territories through attrition?\nGene Hall: Jeff, it's Gene. So, we do, do what we call dynamic territory planning, which is we look at every territory, literally every territory each week to see what the productivity has been and what the kind of trend is. And then what we do is as we have turnover, is one sales proceeds and of course, we have low turnover, we do have people leave every quarter. We look at where is the most productive place with those territories. So, I'll give you just an extreme example. And we used to have salespeople in Russia. We decided, obviously, we weren't going to sell in Russia back when the invasion happened. So, we fill those are territories that are we look at most productive. In a more recent example, if you look at the small tech vendor market, there are sets of small tech venders that used to be able to get funding than in today can't get funding versus others like for especially those in AI that can\u2019t. And so, what we do is literally on a weekly basis, say, okay, but these people believe that we're selling to tech companies that are not going to get funding, let's take those territories and move them over to places where in fact like AI based where they are getting funding. So, we're doing this on a constant basis to make sure our salespeople are always deployed in the most productive territories. We do it with turnover. And again, we have cases where it's clear that they're not going to recover in short term, we'll do it more proactively than that, too. We'll say, we'll actually close those territories down and move like either those people or that headcount to more productive areas.\nCraig Safian: And then just sort of pulling the thread all the way through, we are targeting, even with all that dynamic territory planning, mid-single-digit QBH growth for GTS by the end of the year and high single-digit QBH growth for GBS by the end of the year. And again, implicit in all that are all the things, Gene talked about, that's been our normal operating procedure for the last four or five years now. It's an innovation we put in place in 2019. And again, it doesn't allow us to perfectly match, but it gives us a better chance of making sure that the resources that we're investing in are actually going against the best short-term, medium-term and long-term opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nToni Kaplan: I wanted to focus on the research revenue guide. It seems like you lowered it because of the non-subs business. I know tech vendor actually returned to growth on the subscription side, but the non-subs piece, I think still is -- seems to be declining. I guess, was it because -- your guide down, was it because non-subs was worse than you originally thought? Or is just the trajectory not going to be as quick as you were thinking? Just maybe help us through the trajectory on the non-subs piece.\nCraig Safian: Yes, sure, Toni. I mean, the first thing I'd say is that the entire operational change relates to the non-sub piece, the subscription revenue piece of the overall research revenue. I mean, it's up a little bit from foreign exchange. But from an operational perspective, the guidance is essentially unchanged from last quarter. And again, as we talked about last quarter, we believe that the bottom was going to be either Q1 or Q2. And so, we had a strong, solid Q2 of NCVI and CV growth dialed into our outlook. And so, everything, all the change relates to non-subscription business.\nToni Kaplan: Great. And then, the cash balance is pretty high, below leverage. You added capacity to the buyback program. Maybe just give us an update on like what conditions could we look for to sort of for you to be buying back more stock? I know you already do, but just sort of elevate that level.\nCraig Safian: Yes, sure. So, our basic philosophy on buybacks is to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. And I'd underscore each of those [indiscernible] they're all sort of important in influencing our philosophy on buybacks. What I'd also say, obviously, you know this, and most people on the call know this, we've returned a lot of capital since 2021 back to our shareholders. We're close to what we did full year '23 through the first half of '24. And it's our free capital or operating cash flow and buybacks are pretty close on top of each other through the first six months of the year. And so, we're going to continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined, but we want to make sure that we are driving incremental shareholder value by leveraging our free cash flow and our balance sheet. And so, we look at strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. And in absence of that, buybacks, the bias over the last several years has been buybacks. And I would presume that moving forward, we would be more focused on buybacks going forward. So, you're right, we have cash. We have capacity. We did a pretty good job through the first six months of the year, and we'll continue to make sure that we're driving incremental shareholder value by leveraging our balance sheet and free cash flow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please proceed.\nAndrew Nicholas: I wanted to first focus on new business growth, seemingly stepped up pretty nicely relative to the first quarter. Can you unpack that a little bit? I know at least in GTS, some of that might be some easier comps. But are you seeing better productivity from your sales force? Is there any change to the selling environment? Any color there would be great.\nGene Hall: Andrew, it's Gene. So, what I'd say is the selling environment are pretty much the same. But I do think we're focused on improving the productivity of our teams. And as you know, we're always taking actions to be add to respond to changes in the world. I think that's really the impact we see. It's not that the environment got better in any way, really.\nAndrew Nicholas: Understood. And then, I'm looking at the contract value per client enterprise, and it continues to tick up nicely. Just wanted to confirm my hunch that that's the result of maybe losing some smaller tech vendor clients more so than doing a bunch of more seats into the larger enterprises. But any confirmation there or color on that metric and how you'd expect it to evolve as you have now seen the trough of CV growth.\nGene Hall: So, Andrew, I'll get started. Craig can finish. Basically, the -- our basic strategy with clients is when we sell a client, that's not the end. There's plenty of opportunity to sell more seats to those clients over time. And so, one core part of our selling strategy is to keep selling additional business, additional licensed users to clients that sell them. The other part of our strategy is, of course, to sell new logos as well. And so, because that's one factor that you see there is that actually -- and we've always had this as our strategy, which is always keep growing existing clients as well as new clients.\nCraig Safian: And Andrew, I would just add. If you look at wallet retention being over 100%, that is baked in what Gene just talked about in terms of once we have a client, we then expand our relationship with them each and every year, and we've been doing that for years, and we intend to continue to do that going forward. And there is a little bit of increased churn on the small end that you highlighted, which is also helping modestly, but helping that overall CV per enterprise figure as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed.\nHeather Balsky: I was hoping to talk about your medium-term outlook and your getting back to that low teens growth number. In the context of the environment right now, the selling environment, how are you thinking about the time it could take you to get back there? And also going back to your comments on the third quarter call '23, where you expected tech better return to normal growth in 12 to 18 months. Is that still on the table right now? Or do you think things have changed?\nCraig Safian: Heather, thank you. In terms of the medium-term outlook, it is our goal. And again, we do need a stable, I won't say a great operating environment, but a stable operating environment. I'd argue we're doing really well in a very volatile operating environment globally, probably more volatile than that. We'd all like to see, quite honestly, but we're continuing to do well. GBS is growing in that medium-term guidance range today. The end-user portion or the enterprise leader portion of GTS is growing at high single-digit growth rates. And obviously, we want to get that back up into the 12% to 16% range. And then on the tech vendor side, what I would say is small tech continues to be a super challenging operating environment. We were pleased to see the overall tech vendor business return to growth in this quarter from last quarter, but it is still super challenging, particularly on the lower end of the tech vendor market.\nHeather Balsky: Okay. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, the business tends to see consistent sequential trends in terms of CVs. Just if you look back historically, when you think about the back half of the year, is there any reason that you would deviate in any way from the sort of sequential cadence that you typically see, generally, not like the exact number, but the trend?\nCraig Safian: Generally, no. So, our selling motion, our conference calendar, things like that, which are a big piece of what drives the typical phasing, are pretty stable. So no, I would expect us to follow the similar trends to what we've seen. Obviously, we called out Q1 of this year earlier because it was a little off trend. But I think back half of the year should look like a normal back half of the year for us from that perspective.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Chan with UBS. Please proceed.\nJosh Chan: If I look at the CV growth, so GTS obviously reaccelerated nicely as you had predicted. How do you think about the shape of GBS as that's been kind of moderating slowly perhaps because of the macro. How do you envision GBS trending from here?\nGene Hall: So GBS, first, we grew 12% in the quarter, which we think is really good. The second thing is GBS has a tremendous market opportunity. We are aligned to go capture that opportunity over time. CV is going bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but huge market opportunities there, and we're prepared to go get it.\nCraig Safian: And again, the medium-term objective for that business is 12% to 16% growth, and we continue to believe that the GBS business and the GTS business can both deliver 12% to 16% CV growth.\nJosh Chan: Okay. Great. And then if I can ask a question on margin. I guess the ingredients that led to the slight year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion in Q2, is there any reason that those ingredients wouldn't also hold into the second half?\nCraig Safian: Thank you, Josh. Great question. So, the way to think about the second half again is sort of back to Heather's question a little bit, too, normal phasing from both a revenue perspective and from an operating expense perspective, coupled with continuing to make sure that we are investing for future growth. And again, we talked about mid-single-digit QBH growth for GTS and high single-digit QBH growth for GBS. So, making sure that those investments are dialed into the second half operating expense forecast and plans. The other thing I would note is that Q2 is our highest margin quarter for conferences. So, despite Q4 being the largest revenue quarter, Q2 is actually the highest margin quarter, which drives some of that benefit that you saw in the second quarter. But if you kind of run the math on revenue, normal OpEx phasing, given our conference calendar and also dialing in that incremental investment for the QBH growth, which again, as you know, it doesn't really benefit the results or top line results this year. Those are really investments for the future. That's how you can sort of reconcile from the Q2 EBITDA margins down to the second half EBITDA margins, which then give you that full year outlook of around 23.5%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed.\nBrendan Popson: This is Brendan on for Manav. I just want to ask, there's been some, I guess, just reports on companies facing kind of like a Gen AI tech on their IT budgets just with the expense of some of the new technology. I was just curious if what you guys have seen related to that and kind of what your customers are saying? And any -- if there's any impacts from that? Obviously, it's also an opportunity as well, but just what you're seeing near term.\nGene Hall: Yes, it's a great question. So, Gen AI continues to be a topic of very, very high interest with all of our clients. If you look at kind of our enterprise function leaders as opposed to the tech companies, they're easing into the investments. The tech companies are [indiscernible]. The enterprise functional leader businesses are basically starting to invest and looking for the best use cases where they can get the highest return on Gen AI. I think people are still wrestling with what the right formula is there. It's great for us because it's a topic of very high interest. They're spending money on it, and it's important to them. And so, it's a place where we can really add a lot of value.\nBrendan Popson: Okay. And then just following up. With the cash and leverage, you mentioned -- you always mentioned tuck-in M&A as a possibility. Just kind of give us an idea what, I guess, what kinds of tuck-in M&A you would consider?\nCraig Safian: Brendan, it's Craig. So generally, we think about M&A from kind of three angles. One would be enhancing our research coverage in some area. So, it could be where we need more in marketing or we need more in finance or something like that. So that would be one flavor of acquisition, looking for assets that could enhance the insights to which we provide the operating executives that are a target audience. Second would be sort of a geographic fill-in. So, sort of the same tone and tenor there, but going after geographies where we're not as strong or don't have as much critical mass. And then third and perhaps fourth would be sort of assets or technology type acquisitions that would help us catalyze getting to market faster or buying some capability that is really valuable to us that we can then leverage across the enterprise. And again, if you look at the -- there's a handful of small acquisitions we've done over the last five, six years. We kind of have at least one in each of those categories, and that's sort of what the M&A radar screen looks like today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nSurinder Thind: Can you maybe talk about just the thought behind the cadence for your hiring plans at this point? It sounds like it's going to be quite back-half loaded. Is that just looking for additional data points? Any color there would be helpful.\nGene Hall: So, if you look at our take of our hiring, if you look at the market overall, it's been very, I'd say, uneven over the last few years. There was a pandemic where we slowed down our hiring dramatically. There was the tech bubble afterwards where it's hard to even hire people because the tech companies are suppressively hiring. In the year after that, the tech houses were laying people off. And so, it was very easy to hire people. And so, we've stepped up a couple of years ago very well, and we had a lot of junior people. And so, we want to make sure that those people want to make sure that we got full productivity out of them and also to see kind of what the macroeconomic in geopolitical world looks like. That seems to be more stable now, and we feel like that the tenure of that group we had two years ago now is at a stable point. And so, it makes sense to ramp our hiring up. And the people we hire beginning in the second half of the year are going to position us '25, '26 to '27 because their productivity will improve over the first three years, we hired them. And so, this additional hiring we're planning to do in the second half is really getting back to what we've done traditionally before the rockiness of the last few roads -- in the last few years, and we would expect that kind of hiring trend to continue, which is more even going forward. And this is kind of just getting back to strategy after the last few years of a lot of tumultuous economic times.\nCraig Safian: And Surinder, the other thing I'd just add there is from where we are today, it's another few hundred net people by the end of the year. So, it may sound like a big sort of move. It's actually not given the trending. And so again, if we target that mid-single-digit growth for GTS and high single digit for GBS. It's a few hundred more people between -- net between now and the end of the year.\nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And then you mentioned CrowdStrike in the prepared remarks. How does something like that impact the business? Is it just more engagement with existing clients just wanting to access more resources? Or does this drive incremental demand at the top of the funnel that maybe you can convert in the back half of this year?\nGene Hall: So, our whole strategy is to help our clients with their most important priorities. CrowdStrike on that Friday was certainly one of a big priority. And so, we did see a big uptick in demand for our clients. It helps engagement. We did a bunch of things immediate to help them. We had a panel webinar that day. We had a document that we published that day. We had a weather or live stream, and we did a whole series of things look to help our clients. And so really, we're helping them with a mobile need, which is great for our demand. It's great for not just existing clients, but for new clients. It gives us a reason why they should buy. So, CrowdStrike, the kind for CrowdStrike are one exists to help our clients in these difficult times.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nGeorge Tong: Enterprise functional leader CV growth was 10% in the quarter, which is pretty similar compared to 1Q. Can you elaborate on some of the trends you're seeing here and if the momentum exiting the quarter was stable or improved?\nGene Hall: So, I would say the selling environment was pretty consistent between Q1 and Q2. There's not a lot of change there. I don't think our execution was better. It's just why we had a little bit of pickup in parts of our business. The overall macroeconomic and geopolitical environment didn't change much between Q1 and Q2.\nGeorge Tong: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then research subscription revenue growth outperformed in the quarter, but you're holding your outlook for research subscription revenue unchanged for the full year. What factors are holding you back from raising your research subscription outlook for the full year?\nCraig Safian: George, the way I would characterize it is, we came in roughly where we thought we were going to land from a research subscription revenue perspective in the second quarter. CV growth did accelerate 50 basis points from Q1 to Q2. That was pretty much baked into our full year outlook. And so, from where we stand today, we feel really good about the research description revenue line, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. That's obviously the revenue line that we have the greatest visibility on, but it's also modest changes in CV don't have a huge impact from now until the end of the year. It's really the CV growth delivered for this year will really determine 2025 revenue. So, I think our perspective is sort of on target or on expectation for Q2. No change to the research subscription revenue line for the balance of the year other than the modest uptick that we dialed in for foreign exchange.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nJeff Silber: I wanted to focus on retention. The retention metrics still going down. I know the declines seem to be getting less worse, which is good to see. But what do you think it will take to get the retention metrics starting to move in a positive direction again? Is there anything you can do from your end?\nCraig Safian: So, I'd say focusing on GTS first. So, while retention, as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, for the enterprise function leader part of business is at historical levels and continues to be pretty strong there. And so, I think all you're seeing is the continued tech vendor challenging market. And again, in particular, the small tech vendor part of the market, diluting the retention metrics a little bit. We will eventually wash through this. It will take some time because it's not as simple as thinking about, well, business you sold 24 months ago, you're already through that now and so there are no more issues. It's really client specific in terms of when they got funding, when their funding runs out, when they have cash flow problems, et cetera. And so, I think what you're still seeing is just a drag down from, in particular, small technology companies that is driving the retention stuff. On the GBS, I think we had really, really strong wallet retention there, particularly coming out of the pandemic the wallet retention numbers are still significantly higher than what we report on the GTS side. And so, I'd argue the GBS wallet retention metrics and client retention metrics are relatively strong as well.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Great. And if I could shift over to the contract length for research. If I remember correctly, at one point in time, you were selling more three-year contracts. I might be wrong, but I think more recently, probably shifting a little bit more towards two years. If you could just remind me correct. Are a lot of those two-year terms coming up for renewal over the next few months or so?\nCraig Safian: Yes. Jeff, our standard contract length, I would say, is 24 months. We do write some that are 12 months, and we do write some that are 36 months, but the vast majority are 24 months. And so, we always have a significant amount of contracts coming up for renewal in basically every quarter because our sellers and our clients consume predominantly 24-month contracts. I think our average contract length is somewhere in the 1.7- to 1.8-year range. More than 70% of our contract value is multiyear in nature. And so again, we're always going to have two-year deals and three-year deals coming up for renewal pretty consistently quarter-to-quarter to quarter-to-quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And as I see no further questions in the queue, I will pass the call back to the Chairman and CEO, Gene Hall, for his final comments.\nGene Hall: Here's what I'd like you take away from today's call. Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations. We delivered 10% contract value growth with that enterprise function leaders. We have a vast addressable market opportunity. We have a strong and compelling client value proposition. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to drive sustained double-digit revenue growth over the long term. We will continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actual objective insight to our clients, prudently investing for future growth, generating free cash flow well in excess of net income and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. Thanks for joining us today and look forward to updating you again next quarter.\nOperator: And thank you all for participating in today's conference, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter contract value grew 7% year-over-year, accelerating about 50 basis points from Q1. We believe the first quarter marked the bottom for CV growth this cycle, barring a meaningful shift in the macro or geopolitical environment. Growth may vary from quarter-to-quarter, but we expect the overall trend will be higher from the 6.9% we delivered in the first quarter. Over the medium term, we expect both GTS and GBS to grow 12% to 16%. Second quarter revenue, EBITDA and EPS all came in ahead of our expectations. We are updating our guidance based on the Q2 results, FX and a change in non-subscription research revenue. We have repurchased $565 million of stock through June and remain eager to buy back stock opportunistically. Second quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year as reported and 7% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, about in line with last year. EBITDA was $416 million, up 8% as reported and 10% FX neutral versus second quarter 2023. Adjusted EPS was $3.22, up 13% from Q2 of last year, and free cash flow was $341 million. Research revenue in the second quarter grew 5% year-over-year as reported and 6% on an FX-neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 7% FX neutral. The year-over-year change in non-subscription revenue was similar to Q1 2024. Second quarter research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with last year. Contract value was $4.9 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 7% versus the prior year and up about $67 million from the first quarter. CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew 10%. Contract value and CV growth are FX neutral. CV growth was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates led by the energy, manufacturing and public sectors. CV grew double-digit or high single-digit rates across all enterprise sizes, except small, which has the largest tech vendor mix. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries. Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.8 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 6% versus the prior year. GTS enterprise leader CV increased high single digits. Tech vendor CV returned to growth in the quarter. GTS CV increased $40 million from the first quarter. While retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, up from Q1, enterprise leader wallet retention was consistent with historical levels. GTS new business was up 8% compared to last year. GTS quota-bearing head count was down 2% year-over-year as we manage tech vendor-focused sales territories in response to near-term industry dynamics. Across GTS, we continue to aggressively optimize our territories to align with where we have the best growth opportunities, and we are investing for future growth. We continue to expect mid-single-digit QBH growth by the end of the year. We have the headcount we need to meet commitments for this year. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Global Business Sales contract value was $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 12% year-over-year. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates other than marketing, which grew mid-single digits. Growth was led by the finance, legal and supply chain practices. GBS CV increased $27 million from the first quarter. Wallet retention for GBS was 106% for the quarter, which compares to 109% in the prior year. GBS new business was up 16% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing head count was up 6% year-over-year, and we continue to target high single-digit growth for 2024. As with GTS, a regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $186 million, increasing 10% as reported and 11% FX neutral compared to Q2 of 2023. Adjusting for the movement of conferences across the year, revenue increased about 15% in the quarter. Contribution margin was 58%. Q2 is our seasonally strongest margin quarter of the year. We held 16 destination conferences. Second quarter consulting revenue increased by 13% year-over-year to $143 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenue was up 15%. Consulting contribution margin was 38% in the second quarter. Labor-based revenue was $107 million, up 3% versus Q2 of last year's reported and 5% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at June 30 was $199 million, increasing 16% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength. In contract optimization, we delivered $36 million of revenue in the quarter, up 62% versus the prior year. Our contract optimization business is highly variable. Consolidated cost of services increased 5% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and 6% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher compensation costs. SG&A increased 5% year-over-year in the second quarter as reported and on a FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth, which contributed to higher compensation costs. EBITDA for the second quarter was $416 million, up 8% from last year's reported and up 10% FX neutral. We have performed in the second quarter through effective expense management and a prudent approach to guidance. Depreciation in the quarter of $28 million was up 16% compared to 2023. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $19 million. This is favorable by $4 million versus second quarter of 2023 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate that we have is fully hedged through the third quarter of 2025. The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 24% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25% for the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $3.22, up 13% compared with last year. We had 78 million shares outstanding in the second quarter. This is a reduction of more than 1.5 million shares or about 2% year-over-year. We exited the second quarter with about 78 million shares on an unweighted basis. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $370 million compared with $436 million in Q2 of 2023. The change reflects working capital timing, which we expect to reverse in the second half. CapEx for the quarter was $29 million, in line with our expectations. Free cash flow for the quarter was $341 million. Free cash flow on a rolling four-quarter basis was 17% of revenue and 66% of EBITDA. Free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 121%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. At the end of the second quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our June 30 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.9 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. We repurchased $340 million of our stock during the second quarter. We have more than $1 billion of repurchase capacity after the Board recently increased our share buyback authorization by $600 million. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect recent performance and trends. The outlook for subscription research is higher based on the latest FX rates. We increased the outlook for conferences and consulting. And our EBITDA guidance primarily reflects Q2 upside, partially offset by our updated non-subscription research outlook. For subscription research, which was about 76% of revenue in 2023, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. The executive and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help regardless of the economic environment. For subscription research revenue, based on Q2 results and our outlook for the balance of the year, our FX-neutral guidance is unchanged. We have very high visibility into the subscription research revenue at this point in the year. For non-subscription research, which was about 6% of 2023 revenue, we help small businesses find the right software. We've updated our outlook for this portion of the segment given the most recent trends. We now expect non-subscription revenue of about $305 million for 2024. As a reminder, about 1/3 of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Based on recent FX rates, we expect currency to be roughly neutral in the back half of the year with a modest benefit in Q4. Our updated 2024 guidance is as follows. We expect research revenue of at least $5.105 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. This reflects subscription research revenue growth of about 7%. We expect conferences revenue of at least $565 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 12%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $530 million, which is growth of about 4% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.2 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 5%. We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.460 billion, up $5 million from our prior guidance. We expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $11.05. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of at least $1.08 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. This reflects the conversion from GAAP net income of 138%. After the second quarter ended, we reached the settlement related to pandemic or event cancellation insurance. We expect pretax proceeds of $300 million during the third quarter. This is not yet included in the cash flow or GAAP EPS guidance. Our guidance is based on 78 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of June. And finally, for the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $295 million. Our financial results through the first half have been ahead of our plan despite continuing global macro uncertainty. CV grew high single digits in the quarter, and we believe Q1 was the bottom for CV growth in this cycle. We repurchased $565 million in stock year-to-date through June and remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we've delivered double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion over time. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time, and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? So, I'd say it's definitely more about the fact that operating in a very volatile operating environment and 10 basis points up or down is a relatively simple amount of CV in any given quarter. I think the core message is 6.9 marks the bottom, and we should be above that in every quarter moving forward, it could bounce around a little bit, and ultimately, our medium-term objective is to get both GTS and GBS back to 12% to 16% annual growth rates. And then just sort of pulling the thread all the way through, we are targeting, even with all that dynamic territory planning, mid-single-digit QBH growth for GTS by the end of the year and high single-digit QBH growth for GBS by the end of the year. And again, implicit in all that are all the things, Gene talked about, that's been our normal operating procedure for the last four or five years now. It's an innovation we put in place in 2019. And again, it doesn't allow us to perfectly match, but it gives us a better chance of making sure that the resources that we're investing in are actually going against the best short-term, medium-term and long-term opportunities. Yes, sure, Toni. I mean, the first thing I'd say is that the entire operational change relates to the non-sub piece, the subscription revenue piece of the overall research revenue. I mean, it's up a little bit from foreign exchange. But from an operational perspective, the guidance is essentially unchanged from last quarter. And again, as we talked about last quarter, we believe that the bottom was going to be either Q1 or Q2. And so, we had a strong, solid Q2 of NCVI and CV growth dialed into our outlook. And so, everything, all the change relates to non-subscription business. Yes, sure. So, our basic philosophy on buybacks is to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined. And I'd underscore each of those [indiscernible] they're all sort of important in influencing our philosophy on buybacks. What I'd also say, obviously, you know this, and most people on the call know this, we've returned a lot of capital since 2021 back to our shareholders. We're close to what we did full year '23 through the first half of '24. And it's our free capital or operating cash flow and buybacks are pretty close on top of each other through the first six months of the year. And so, we're going to continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined, but we want to make sure that we are driving incremental shareholder value by leveraging our free cash flow and our balance sheet. And so, we look at strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. And in absence of that, buybacks, the bias over the last several years has been buybacks. And I would presume that moving forward, we would be more focused on buybacks going forward. So, you're right, we have cash. We have capacity. We did a pretty good job through the first six months of the year, and we'll continue to make sure that we're driving incremental shareholder value by leveraging our balance sheet and free cash flow. And Andrew, I would just add. If you look at wallet retention being over 100%, that is baked in what Gene just talked about in terms of once we have a client, we then expand our relationship with them each and every year, and we've been doing that for years, and we intend to continue to do that going forward. And there is a little bit of increased churn on the small end that you highlighted, which is also helping modestly, but helping that overall CV per enterprise figure as well. Heather, thank you. In terms of the medium-term outlook, it is our goal. And again, we do need a stable, I won't say a great operating environment, but a stable operating environment. I'd argue we're doing really well in a very volatile operating environment globally, probably more volatile than that. We'd all like to see, quite honestly, but we're continuing to do well. GBS is growing in that medium-term guidance range today. The end-user portion or the enterprise leader portion of GTS is growing at high single-digit growth rates. And obviously, we want to get that back up into the 12% to 16% range. And then on the tech vendor side, what I would say is small tech continues to be a super challenging operating environment. We were pleased to see the overall tech vendor business return to growth in this quarter from last quarter, but it is still super challenging, particularly on the lower end of the tech vendor market. Generally, no. So, our selling motion, our conference calendar, things like that, which are a big piece of what drives the typical phasing, are pretty stable. So no, I would expect us to follow the similar trends to what we've seen. Obviously, we called out Q1 of this year earlier because it was a little off trend. But I think back half of the year should look like a normal back half of the year for us from that perspective. And again, the medium-term objective for that business is 12% to 16% growth, and we continue to believe that the GBS business and the GTS business can both deliver 12% to 16% CV growth. Thank you, Josh. Great question. So, the way to think about the second half again is sort of back to Heather's question a little bit, too, normal phasing from both a revenue perspective and from an operating expense perspective, coupled with continuing to make sure that we are investing for future growth. And again, we talked about mid-single-digit QBH growth for GTS and high single-digit QBH growth for GBS. So, making sure that those investments are dialed into the second half operating expense forecast and plans. The other thing I would note is that Q2 is our highest margin quarter for conferences. So, despite Q4 being the largest revenue quarter, Q2 is actually the highest margin quarter, which drives some of that benefit that you saw in the second quarter. But if you kind of run the math on revenue, normal OpEx phasing, given our conference calendar and also dialing in that incremental investment for the QBH growth, which again, as you know, it doesn't really benefit the results or top line results this year. Those are really investments for the future. That's how you can sort of reconcile from the Q2 EBITDA margins down to the second half EBITDA margins, which then give you that full year outlook of around 23.5%. Brendan, it's Craig. So generally, we think about M&A from kind of three angles. One would be enhancing our research coverage in some area. So, it could be where we need more in marketing or we need more in finance or something like that. So that would be one flavor of acquisition, looking for assets that could enhance the insights to which we provide the operating executives that are a target audience. Second would be sort of a geographic fill-in. So, sort of the same tone and tenor there, but going after geographies where we're not as strong or don't have as much critical mass. And then third and perhaps fourth would be sort of assets or technology type acquisitions that would help us catalyze getting to market faster or buying some capability that is really valuable to us that we can then leverage across the enterprise. And again, if you look at the -- there's a handful of small acquisitions we've done over the last five, six years. We kind of have at least one in each of those categories, and that's sort of what the M&A radar screen looks like today. And Surinder, the other thing I'd just add there is from where we are today, it's another few hundred net people by the end of the year. So, it may sound like a big sort of move. It's actually not given the trending. And so again, if we target that mid-single-digit growth for GTS and high single digit for GBS. It's a few hundred more people between -- net between now and the end of the year. George, the way I would characterize it is, we came in roughly where we thought we were going to land from a research subscription revenue perspective in the second quarter. CV growth did accelerate 50 basis points from Q1 to Q2. That was pretty much baked into our full year outlook. And so, from where we stand today, we feel really good about the research description revenue line, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. That's obviously the revenue line that we have the greatest visibility on, but it's also modest changes in CV don't have a huge impact from now until the end of the year. It's really the CV growth delivered for this year will really determine 2025 revenue. So, I think our perspective is sort of on target or on expectation for Q2. No change to the research subscription revenue line for the balance of the year other than the modest uptick that we dialed in for foreign exchange. So, I'd say focusing on GTS first. So, while retention, as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, for the enterprise function leader part of business is at historical levels and continues to be pretty strong there. And so, I think all you're seeing is the continued tech vendor challenging market. And again, in particular, the small tech vendor part of the market, diluting the retention metrics a little bit. We will eventually wash through this. It will take some time because it's not as simple as thinking about, well, business you sold 24 months ago, you're already through that now and so there are no more issues. It's really client specific in terms of when they got funding, when their funding runs out, when they have cash flow problems, et cetera. And so, I think what you're still seeing is just a drag down from, in particular, small technology companies that is driving the retention stuff. On the GBS, I think we had really, really strong wallet retention there, particularly coming out of the pandemic the wallet retention numbers are still significantly higher than what we report on the GTS side. And so, I'd argue the GBS wallet retention metrics and client retention metrics are relatively strong as well. Yes. Jeff, our standard contract length, I would say, is 24 months. We do write some that are 12 months, and we do write some that are 36 months, but the vast majority are 24 months. And so, we always have a significant amount of contracts coming up for renewal in basically every quarter because our sellers and our clients consume predominantly 24-month contracts. I think our average contract length is somewhere in the 1.7- to 1.8-year range. More than 70% of our contract value is multiyear in nature. And so again, we're always going to have two-year deals and three-year deals coming up for renewal pretty consistently quarter-to-quarter to quarter-to-quarter."

            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner remains resilient in a complex environment. In Q2, contract value grew high-single digits. Financial results for the second quarter were ahead of expectations, and we delivered strong profitability and free cash flow. The external environment remains volatile uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Leaders across every enterprise faced more simultaneous challenges than ever before. For example, small technology companies continue to face funding challenges. Supply chain shifts are impacting many industries. The banking industry continues to deal with higher interest rates. There are budget challenges in the public sector, persistent several threats, the potential impacts of generative AI. The list goes on. Enterprise leaders and their teams know they need help, and they know Gartner is the best source for the actionable objective insight, they need to drive smarter decisions and achieve stronger performance on their mission-critical priorities. Our value proposition helps our clients to save time, save money, gain confidence, manage risk, develop leadership skills, enhance their teams and achieve success. Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our search business serves leaders across all of enterprise functions in every industry and in every geography. Our market opportunity is vast. Within our research business, contract value with enterprise function leaders grew 10%, and our tech vendor clients returned to growth. We continue to guide clients through a wide range of topics, including generative AI, supply chain optimization, leader and manager development, cost optimization, cybersecurity and the recent CrowdStrike outage. Through relentless execution of proven practices, we deliver unparalleled value, whether our clients are thriving, struggling, anywhere in between. Our research business serves executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS new business grew 8%. Contract value grew 6%. Contract value with GTS enterprise function leaders grew high single digits. Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, lean, legal, sales and more. GBS new business grew 16%. GBS contract value grew 12%. Gartner Conferences deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. Revenue grew 11% in the second quarter, and the outlook for conferences remains strong. Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenue grew 15%. People are at the heart of everything we do. We get better, faster, stronger every year because we work effectively as one team to deliver unparalleled value to our clients. And our teams are committed to driving relentless execution of the best practices that will fuel long-term sustained double-digit growth. In closing, Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations. We delivered 10% contract value growth with enterprise function leaders. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth. We'll continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actionable objective insight to our clients, prudently investing for future growth and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. We expect to deliver modest margin expansion over time, and we'll continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. All of this and more positions us to continue our sustained track record of success far into the future. With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Jeff, it's Gene. So, we do, do what we call dynamic territory planning, which is we look at every territory, literally every territory each week to see what the productivity has been and what the kind of trend is. And then what we do is as we have turnover, is one sales proceeds and of course, we have low turnover, we do have people leave every quarter. We look at where is the most productive place with those territories. So, I'll give you just an extreme example. And we used to have salespeople in Russia. We decided, obviously, we weren't going to sell in Russia back when the invasion happened. So, we fill those are territories that are we look at most productive. In a more recent example, if you look at the small tech vendor market, there are sets of small tech venders that used to be able to get funding than in today can't get funding versus others like for especially those in AI that can't. And so, what we do is literally on a weekly basis, say, okay, but these people believe that we're selling to tech companies that are not going to get funding, let's take those territories and move them over to places where in fact like AI based where they are getting funding. So, we're doing this on a constant basis to make sure our salespeople are always deployed in the most productive territories. We do it with turnover. And again, we have cases where it's clear that they're not going to recover in short term, we'll do it more proactively than that, too. We'll say, we'll actually close those territories down and move like either those people or that headcount to more productive areas. Andrew, it's Gene. So, what I'd say is the selling environment are pretty much the same. But I do think we're focused on improving the productivity of our teams. And as you know, we're always taking actions to be add to respond to changes in the world. I think that's really the impact we see. It's not that the environment got better in any way, really. So, Andrew, I'll get started. Craig can finish. Basically, the -- our basic strategy with clients is when we sell a client, that's not the end. There's plenty of opportunity to sell more seats to those clients over time. And so, one core part of our selling strategy is to keep selling additional business, additional licensed users to clients that sell them. The other part of our strategy is, of course, to sell new logos as well. And so, because that's one factor that you see there is that actually -- and we've always had this as our strategy, which is always keep growing existing clients as well as new clients. So GBS, first, we grew 12% in the quarter, which we think is really good. The second thing is GBS has a tremendous market opportunity. We are aligned to go capture that opportunity over time. CV is going bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, but huge market opportunities there, and we're prepared to go get it. Yes, it's a great question. So, Gen AI continues to be a topic of very, very high interest with all of our clients. If you look at kind of our enterprise function leaders as opposed to the tech companies, they're easing into the investments. The tech companies are [indiscernible]. The enterprise functional leader businesses are basically starting to invest and looking for the best use cases where they can get the highest return on Gen AI. I think people are still wrestling with what the right formula is there. It's great for us because it's a topic of very high interest. They're spending money on it, and it's important to them. And so, it's a place where we can really add a lot of value. So, if you look at our take of our hiring, if you look at the market overall, it's been very, I'd say, uneven over the last few years. There was a pandemic where we slowed down our hiring dramatically. There was the tech bubble afterwards where it's hard to even hire people because the tech companies are suppressively hiring. In the year after that, the tech houses were laying people off. And so, it was very easy to hire people. And so, we've stepped up a couple of years ago very well, and we had a lot of junior people. And so, we want to make sure that those people want to make sure that we got full productivity out of them and also to see kind of what the macroeconomic in geopolitical world looks like. That seems to be more stable now, and we feel like that the tenure of that group we had two years ago now is at a stable point. And so, it makes sense to ramp our hiring up. And the people we hire beginning in the second half of the year are going to position us '25, '26 to '27 because their productivity will improve over the first three years, we hired them. And so, this additional hiring we're planning to do in the second half is really getting back to what we've done traditionally before the rockiness of the last few roads -- in the last few years, and we would expect that kind of hiring trend to continue, which is more even going forward. And this is kind of just getting back to strategy after the last few years of a lot of tumultuous economic times. So, our whole strategy is to help our clients with their most important priorities. CrowdStrike on that Friday was certainly one of a big priority. And so, we did see a big uptick in demand for our clients. It helps engagement. We did a bunch of things immediate to help them. We had a panel webinar that day. We had a document that we published that day. We had a weather or live stream, and we did a whole series of things look to help our clients. And so really, we're helping them with a mobile need, which is great for our demand. It's great for not just existing clients, but for new clients. It gives us a reason why they should buy. So, CrowdStrike, the kind for CrowdStrike are one exists to help our clients in these difficult times. So, I would say the selling environment was pretty consistent between Q1 and Q2. There's not a lot of change there. I don't think our execution was better. It's just why we had a little bit of pickup in parts of our business. The overall macroeconomic and geopolitical environment didn't change much between Q1 and Q2. Here's what I'd like you take away from today's call. Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations. We delivered 10% contract value growth with that enterprise function leaders. We have a vast addressable market opportunity. We have a strong and compelling client value proposition. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to drive sustained double-digit revenue growth over the long term. We will continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actual objective insight to our clients, prudently investing for future growth, generating free cash flow well in excess of net income and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. Thanks for joining us today and look forward to updating you again next quarter."

[Operator Instructions] After comments by Gene Hall, Gartner's Chief Executive Officer; and Craig Safian, Gartner's Chief Financial Officer, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  \n This call will include a discussion of first quarter 2024 financial results and Gartner's outlook for 2024 as disclosed in today's earnings release and earnings supplement, both posted to our website, investor.gartner.com.  \n On the call, unless stated otherwise, all references to EBITDA or for adjusted EBITDA, with the adjustments as described in our earnings release and supplement, while contract values and associated growth rates we discuss are based on 2024 foreign exchange rates, while growth rates in Gene's comments are FX neutral, unless stated otherwise. All references to share counts are for fully diluted weighted average share counts, unless stated otherwise.  \n Reconciliations for all non-GAAP numbers we use are available in the Investor Relations section of the gartner.com website. \n As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, certain statements made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can vary materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those contained in the company's 2023 annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as well as in other filings with the SEC. I encourage all of you to review the risk factors listed in these documents.  \n Now I will turn the call over to Gartner's Chief Executive Officer, Gene Hall. \nEugene Hall: Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner remains resilient in a complex environment. In Q1, contract value grew high single digits. Natural results for the quarter were ahead of expectations. We delivered strong profitability and free cash flow, and we increased our guidance for 2024 on an FX neutral basis.  \n The world continues to experience broad geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Higher interest rates and uncertain outlook continue to affect banks. Federal and local governments are struggling to shifting priorities. Inflation remains challenging for companies in many sectors, such as health care. Supply chains continue to be strained. \n We continue to see big shifts in where people work, which is affecting the real estate sector. Cybersecurity continues to be a global and universal threat. And enterprise leaders are just beginning to understand how to leverage artificial intelligence in their organizations.\n Enterprise leaders and their teams know they need help, and they know Gartner is the best source for that help. We provide the insights, tools and advice to drive smart decisions and achieve stronger performance on their mission-critical priorities. Our insights often make the difference between success and failure for the leaders we work with and the enterprises they serve. Gartner guides the leaders who shape the world.  \n Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research business serves enterprises across all major functions in every industry and every geography. Our market opportunity is vast. We deliver unparalleled value to our clients, whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between.  \n In Q1, our clients experienced more challenging macroeconomic conditions, which led to a tougher selling environment. Because of the incredible value we deliver, contract value in our enterprise functional leader business grew 10%. \n Our tech vendor clients continue to be affected by sizable layoffs as well as reductions and shifts in venture capital investments. In addition, we had higher than normal levels of tech vendor contracts up for renewal in Q1, as expected.  \n We guided clients through a wide range of challenging topics, including cybersecurity, supply chain optimization, data analytics, leader and manager development, managing emerging risks, cost optimization and more. Artificial intelligence was a topic with a high level of interest across every business function we serve. \n Gartner serves executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs, Chief Marketing Officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 5%. GTS contract value with enterprise function leaders grew at high single digits.  \n Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, legal, sales and more. GBS contract value grew 12%.  \n Gartner Conferences deliver valuable insights to a highly engaged audience. We had a great start to the year, including the launch of two new Conferences. The outlook for Conferences remains strong.  \n Gartner Consulting is the extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT Research business. Consulting revenue grew 7%. Labor-based revenue was up 13%. We drove a strong performance in contract optimization against a tough compare.  \n People are at the heart of our business. I just returned from our sales recognition events where I spent time with some of our top performers. Our sales teams are enthusiastic about our prospects for growth in 2024. They love Gartner's strategy, culture and ability to innovate. Gartner is a place where our associates build lifelong careers in sales and beyond.  \n Looking ahead, we updated our guidance for the stronger dollar and increased revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow on a FX-neutral basis.  \n In closing, Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations and 10% contract value growth with enterprise function leaders. Gartner is well positioned for contract value growth to accelerate as we move through the year. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth.  \n We will continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actionable objective insight to our clients, prudently investing for future growth and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. \n We expect margins will expand modestly over time, and we'll continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. All of this and more positions us to continue our sustained record of success are into the future.  \n With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. \nCraig Safian: Thank you, Gene, and good morning. First quarter financial results were better than planned with particular strength in profitability and free cash flow. We remain well positioned for the global CV growth rate to accelerate from the first or second quarter of this year. We are increasing our revenue, profit and free cash flow guidance on an operating basis and updating for the stronger U.S. dollar. We have a lot of capacity for share repurchases and remain eager to buy back stock opportunistically.  \n First quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, about in line with last year. EBITDA was $382 million, ahead of our guidance and up modestly from first quarter 2023. Adjusted EPS was $2.93, up 2% from Q1 of last year, and free cash flow was $166 million.\n Research revenue in the first quarter grew 4% year-over-year as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 6% FX-neutral. Non-subscription revenue was similar to Q4 2023 following changes we made during the fourth quarter, which we discussed in February. First quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with last year. \n Contract value, or CV, was $4.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 7% versus the prior year and down about $10 million from the fourth quarter 2023. The NCVI results reflect the higher-than-normal level of tech vendor contracts up for renewal, which we discussed in February. In addition, Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter for new business.  \n CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew 10%. CV growth is FX neutral. CV growth outside of our tech vendor client base was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of the industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates led by the energy, manufacturing and public sectors. \n CV grew double-digit or high single-digit rates across all enterprise sizes except small, which was about flat and has the largest tech vendor mix. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries.  \n Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 5% versus the prior year. GTS enterprise leader CV increased high single digits. Tech vendor CV was down slightly year-over-year. GTS CV was $22 million lower than the fourth quarter. \n Wallet retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, which compares to 104% in the prior year. Enterprise leader wallet retention was consistent with historical levels. As expected, tech vendors were the key driver of the change year-over-year.  \n GTS new business was 1% lower than last year, even as enterprise leader new business increased year-over-year. GTS quota-bearing headcount was down 2% year-over-year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit QBH growth by the end of the year. The near-term hiring focus is in the enterprise leader portion of the business. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.  \n Global Business Sales contract value was $1.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 12% year-over-year. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates other than sales, which grew mid-single digits. Growth was led by finance, legal and supply chain. \n GBS CV increased $12 million from the fourth quarter, while retention for GBS was 107% for the quarter, which compares to 110% in the prior year. GBS new business was up 7% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing headcount was also up 7% year-over-year. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.  \n Conferences revenue for the first quarter was $70 million, modestly ahead of our expectations during a seasonally small period. We had two successful launches in the quarter: our CFO and Finance Executive Conference in Australia; and our Data & Analytics Summit in Brazil. Contribution margin in the quarter was 33%, consistent with typical seasonality and reflecting investments for future growth. We held 12 destination conferences in the quarter.  \n First quarter Consulting revenues increased by 6% year-over-year to $135 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 7%. Consulting contribution margin was 40% in the first quarter. Labor-based revenues were $109 million, up 12% versus Q1 of last year's reported and 13% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at March 31 was $188 million, increasing 17% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength.  \n Our contract optimization business is highly variable. We delivered $26 million of revenue in the quarter against a tough prior year compare. Consolidated cost of services increased 6% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 5% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher compensation costs.  \n SG&A increased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth and higher compensation costs. \n EBITDA for the first quarter was $382 million, up modestly from last year. First quarter strength compared to our guidance reflected modest revenue upside, effective expense management and a prudent approach to our initial guidance. Depreciation in the quarter of $26 million was up about 10% compared to 2023.  \n Net interest expense, exclusive deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $18 million. This is favorable by $9 million versus the first quarter of 2023 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through the third quarter of 2025. \n The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 20% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25% for the quarter.  \n Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2.93, up 2% compared with last year. We had 79 million shares outstanding in the first quarter. This is a reduction of close to 1 million shares or about 2% year-over-year. We exited the first quarter with about 79 million shares on an unweighted basis.  \n Operating cash flow for the quarter was $189 million, up 15% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $23 million, up modestly year-over-year. \n Free cash flow for the quarter was $166 million. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 72% of EBITDA. Free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 135%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. \n At the end of the first quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our March 31 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. During the quarter, we closed on a new 5-year $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings from the existing credit agreement were rolled over into the new unsecured revolver. The amount drawn remains fully hedged. Our capital structure is now 100% unsecured. After Moody's upgraded our credit in April, we now have three investment grade ratings from Fitch, S&P and Moody's.  \n Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.9 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. \n We repurchased $225 million of our stock during the first quarter. We expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. At the end of March, we had about $830 million authorized for repurchases. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and, combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital.  \n We are raising our full year guidance on an FX-neutral basis to reflect Q1 performance. The dollar has gotten stronger since we reported in February, which is also incorporated into the guidance.  \n For Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help, regardless of the economic environment. \n For Research revenue, based on Q1 results and our outlook for the balance of the year, our guidance on an FX-neutral basis is unchanged. The guidance also reflects the CV growth rate reaccelerating this year. New business strength and improvements in retention would lead to upside to our guidance. And Research subscription revenue growth will likely lag CV growth reacceleration by about a quarter or 2 on an FX-neutral basis.  \n The nonsubscription revenue outlook continues to reflect the shift to higher-quality traffic sources we discussed last quarter. We saw pricing stabilizing over the past few months. An improvement in pricing would represent upside to the guidance.  \n The first quarter for Conferences is seasonally small. We continue to expect strong performance for the full year. We expect similar seasonality to what we saw in 2023 with Q4 the largest quarter, followed by Q2.  \n For Consulting, we continue to see demand on our labor-based services in areas like digital transformation and cost optimization. Contract optimization has had several very strong years and is highly variable. We've incorporated a prudent outlook for this part of the segment.  \n For consolidated expenses, we are investing for future growth, even as we have taken a balanced view of the timing of revenue flowing into the P&L. We recommend thinking about expenses sequentially with notable seasonality driven by the conferences calendar and merit increases. \n As a reminder, about 1/3 of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. With the strengthening dollar, we now expect FX-neutral growth to be higher than reported growth by about 0.5 point for revenue and around a full point for EBITDA for the full year.  \n Our updated 2024 guidance is as follows. We expect Research revenue of at least $5.115 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. First quarter results were about in line with our expectations. We updated for the stronger dollar. \n We expect Conferences revenue of at least $560 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 11%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $525 million, which is growth of about 3% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.2 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 5%.  \n We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.455 billion, up $35 million from our prior guidance before the effect of a stronger dollar. We expect typical operating expense seasonality to continue through the rest of the year. We now expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $10.90. \n For 2024, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.08 billion, up $15 million from our prior guidance. The higher free cash flow reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of 139%. Our guidance is based on 79 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of March. And finally, for the second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $390 million.  \n Our financial performance started the year ahead of our plan, despite continuing global macro uncertainty and a dynamic tech vendor market. CV grew high single digits in the quarter, and we expect CV growth to reaccelerate from the first or second quarter of this year. \n Revenue and EBITDA performance exceeded our expectations, we increased our operating guidance and incorporated the stronger U.S. dollar into the outlook.  \n Free cash flow was strong in the quarter, and we increased the guidance for the full year. We repurchased about $225 million in stock year-to-date through March and remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined.\n Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand EBITDA margins modestly over time. \n We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.  \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jeff Meuler from Baird. \nJeffrey Meuler: Hello? Can you hear me? \nOperator: Yes, sir, we can hear you now. \nJeffrey Meuler: Yes. Sorry about that. Was hoping you could give more perspective on GTS new business sold trends, and I'm obviously keying in on the year-over-year being a bit weaker this quarter than last. \n And I think that was one of the factors that you were pointing to for confidence in the CV reacceleration during 2024. So just any perspective? Did it soften at all later in the quarter? Was it consistent with your plan? \nCraig Safian: Jeff, it's Craig. Thank you for the question. On the new business side, again, you need to really differentiate between what we're seeing from a tech vendor perspective and what we're seeing on the enterprise function leader portion of the GTS business. \n And what we saw was GTS new business for enterprise function leaders was up low single digits year-over-year in the quarter and it was down a little bit year-over-year on the tech vendor side. And so those two dynamics are really what hit us in the first quarter.  \n I would say just on the tech vendor side, and I'm sure we'll talk about this quite a bit as we work through the questions, that we highlighted in February that we had a larger-than-normal amount of contracts coming up for renewal on the tech vendor side. Those were typically 2- or 3-year deals, and so they hadn't been touched in a few years. And obviously, the tech market is very different today than it was a few years ago.  \n And generally, what we're seeing, particularly with our medium to larger-sized tech clients, is they are staying with us, but there is some -- still some recalibration. And what that means is there's less new business than normal on those renewals.  \n Out over the medium term and long term, we expect our tech vendor business to be a 12% to 16% grower, but we're still, and again, you guys can often read the headlines as well as we can, we're still in a pretty challenging tech vendor end market. \n Gene, I don't know if you want to add. \nEugene Hall: The only thing to add is that our sales to new logos in tech vendors has been strong. And so what Craig reflected is that it's not the new logos that's actually been strong. It's when we have a renewal, how much of -- how many digital seats they buy. \nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then just on retention, obviously, we have your publicly reported metrics, and just want to recognize that you had previously called out the outsized renewals for tech vendor this quarter. \n So the question, I guess, is if I -- if you isolate just the business that comes up for renewal in a period, is the -- are the renewal rates now largely stable kind of quarter-to-quarter at this point that you just needed to get through the tail of those renewals? I'm just trying to, I guess, just figure out how stable it is on what's coming up for renewal. \nCraig Safian: Yes. I think, Jeff, it's a great question. We have seen some stability in the retention rates. And generally, if you look at our NCVI in any given quarter, it's a combination of what did we renew and how much new business we sold. \n And with Q1 being a seasonally very small new business quarter, historically, it's always been that way, coupled with the disproportionate amount of tech vendor contracts we had coming up for renewal, the reason we highlighted that in February is because that makes for a tough math, if you will, on NCVI in a given quarter.  \n We are seeing retention rates stabilize. We do see a strong pipeline across the board in both GTS and GBS. And so again, we firmly believe that contract value growth is going to reaccelerate this year, as we indicated in our prepared remarks. And stable retention rates will certainly be an ingredient in that reacceleration. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. \nToni Kaplan: I was hoping you could just comment on the first part of the last question, the recalibration and seats as contracts come up for renewal. Are you seeing the large enterprise clients reducing seats? Or was that more of a comment around the tech vendor? \n And basically, if you could give sort of an outlook on how you think the tech vendor trends go from here and what percent of business is related to tech vendor at this point. You probably gave it. I just missed it. \nEugene Hall: Toni, it's Gene. There's a couple of things going on. One is in the small end of the market, the companies that got funding 2 or 3 years ago that are now coming up for renewal, many of those companies are having difficulty getting funding for two reasons. \n One is that the interest rates are higher. The second is there's been a big shift to where venture capitalist want to fund AI. Not surprised that AI start-ups compared to the software start-ups they were funding 2 years ago. And so we're seeing kind of as those come up for renewal, the ones that aren't getting funding don't do as well. And that's why new logos are doing well through selling to the AI start-ups.  \n And then you have the large end of the market, where we have different front going, where they're laying off tens of thousand people. And so they're -- it's a tougher selling environment than it has been in the past.  \n As Craig mentioned, Q1 is our worst quarter in terms of just look at the SKU of renewals in terms of the most -- the largest number of those renewals coming up, and so we expect to get better through the year. \nCraig Safian: And then, Toni, just for context, the tech vendor CV is a little less than 25% of total CV, which is pretty consistent with where we've been over the last several quarters. \nToni Kaplan: Yes. Okay. Great. And then wanted to ask on AI. You've said in the past that it hasn't generated extra demand, and that it's just sort of another topic that clients are interested in. I guess, why shouldn't you see increased demand for additional seats across both GTS and GBS? \n It seems like it's a topic that more people within the organization would probably need to learn more about. And so -- and then maybe any ways you've been able to utilize AI for efficiency or selling purposes? \nEugene Hall: So Toni, there's a broad level of interest in AI across each of our functional areas. So whether it's IT, marketing, sales, finance, legal, every single function has a very high interest in AI, and we have a large research team that is focused on making sure we understand the applications in AI in each of those functional areas. And so we have a large installed base of existing clients. Most of those clients are -- the existing clients are looking at our AI research and using it.  \n When we sell to new client, they also -- that's a very hot topic they want to talk to us about it, and it is a good reason to close a sale. If I contrast it though, like 2 years ago, about even cloud computing, that was -- AI wasn't the hot topic, cloud computing was. \n And so the topic has shifted, and it's a very high level of interest, just as cloud computing was 2 or 3 years ago. And so it's not like that we didn't have demand, just all of a sudden increased demand. It kind -- has kind of taken the place of things that were in the past.  \n And again, as we -- and the other thing I'd say is companies are now just kind of trying to figure out whether it's relevant, what the trade-offs are, what the cost is. And I think that this could gather momentum over time as they sort these kinds of things out. \n It's good for us no matter how you look at it. But it's not like we had no business, and this is going to lead to a step change. It's more like it's substituted other things that we're helping with. Again, if you think about the margin over time, it will be a net plus.  \n And with regard to internal usage, we have a number of internal uses that we are using mainly with data analytics, having very sophisticated machine learning algorithms and neural networks in terms of understanding our business. That's one of the big applications we have for it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. \nHeather Balsky: I'd love to touch on your, I guess, I'll call it guidance that you still think CV should start to accelerate, either after this quarter or after next quarter. It sounds like the selling environment got tougher. We're still seeing layoffs in the tech industry. I'm just curious what you're seeing right now that still gives you confidence that this is the year we see the inflection?  \n And also just kind of -- was there anything in the first quarter that kind of was a positive sign in your view, realizing that 1Q is kind of a lighter quarter generally in your business? But just help us get the conviction you have in the inflection. \nEugene Hall: Heather, let me start. So our -- Q1, our enterprise function leaders CV grew 10%, so it was a little tougher economic environment. Decisions got pushed. We still grew 10% in that kind of environment.  \n The second thing is we talked about the tech sector, we had a -- particularly, we had a lot more renewals from 2 or 3 years ago that's coming up and finishes later in the year. \n And the third thing is if we look at our go-forward sales pipeline, our go-forward sales pipeline is very robust. And so those are the kinds of things that give us confidence that the outlook that we gave is very accurate. \nCraig Safian: Well, I think -- and just to add to that, Heather, our sales force continues to come up the 10-year curve. And so every day, they're a little bit more experienced and a little bit more tenured. And that gives us confidence around the reacceleration. \n And I think also, we are a learning company that are very agile. And even in a tougher environment, we are always working for ways to perform better in that tougher environment. And we learned a lot from prior dislocations. We've learned a lot even from the last couple of quarters, and we were applying those things. And we believe that actually will have a positive impact and help fuel that reacceleration as well. \nHeather Balsky: And another question we got. You talked about the heavy renewals in the quarter, and you've warned us about that. As you think about the renewals coming from the, I guess, sort of peak period for the tech vendor space, how does the rest of the year look in terms of the renewals coming up? \nCraig Safian: Yes. I mean, it's -- so obviously, it's got to add up to 100% over the course of the year. And so we were a little overweighted in the first quarter on those tech vendor renewals, and it's much more even over the balance of the year. And again, it's another reason that gives us confidence. \n So if you look at the way the renewals work and the way our new business ramps over the course of the year, that's what gives us confidence that either coming off of Q1 or Q2, you will see the reacceleration in the total contract value growth rate. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. \nAndrew Nicholas: I wanted to first ask on operating expenses. Pretty significant upside to your adjusted EBITDA outlook on Q1. Just wondering where the major drivers were relative to your expectations in terms of spend. Any areas in particular where you're getting a bit more efficiency than you had expected and maybe what that means for operating expenses going through the rest of this year? \nCraig Safian: Andrew, I'd say the OpEx favorability was pretty broad based. It wasn't any one particular area where we harvested significant savings. I would say the FX rate actually helped a little bit there, too. It obviously hurts on revenue, but helps on expenses. \n And so we have dialed in the savings in the areas that we saw in Q1. Some of that is timing. Some of that, we're going to catch up on. And some of that is real savings. And so the new guidance reflects what we learned from Q1 from an OpEx perspective. \n But don't overlook the foreign exchange. As we talked about, the dollar has strengthened quite a bit. And about 1/3 of our operating expenses are denominated in currencies outside of the U.S. dollar. And so those pretty large movements can actually impact the reported OpEx and revenue pretty significantly, but again all reflected now in the new guide. \nAndrew Nicholas: Got it. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about Conferences. I think you said you added two new Conferences in the first quarter. Can you just kind of talk about where you sit in terms of your plans on the Conference build out front? \n I know you had hoped to have, at some point in the future, a conference in every single region for every single kind of GBS and GTS seat. So if you could just kind of update us on that progress and the momentum in building out that plan. \nCraig Safian: Yes. And so that is still the plan, right? Strategy is for us to have destination conference for every major constituency that we serve, role that we serve on every major region or geography in which we operate. And I think the two launches in the first quarter, while small, are indicative of that. \n And so we've expanded our finance, our CFO conferences to Australia in the first quarter, again, sort of building out that portfolio. And we brought back a Data & Analytics Summit in Brazil, again, because we've got a large business in Brazil, and there's demand for data and analytics. \n This year, 2024, we're going from 47 conferences last year to 51 in 2024. I would expect us to have a similar sort of build over the next several years as we continue to build out the Conferences portfolio to support the Research business. \nEugene Hall: The other thing we're doing to Andrew, too, is for some of these existing conferences, we're moving to larger venues, so that we actually can accommodate the incremental demand that we're seeing, which is substantial. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Josh Chan from UBS. \nJoshua Chan: Is there a way to estimate how much the elevated renewals in Q1 impacted your CV growth? And I guess, relatedly, absent this elevated renewal impact in Q2, how should we think about the NCVI in Q2 as compared to last year, which should theoretically be a pretty easy comparison, I think? \nCraig Safian: Thanks. Josh, so again, I think the combination, as we talked about, of more than normal contracts coming up for renewal against our smallest new business quarter is really -- and the continued tech vendor challenges is really the story around the Q1 NCVI and the Q1 CV growth. \n As you think about moving through the year, the simple way that I think about whether CV growth accelerates or not is just comparing an expectation to your point on what the quarter NCVI is going to be in this year compared to what the NCVI was last year. And so roughly speaking, last year, in the second quarter, we did around $40 million worth of NCVI across GTS and GBS. \n For the contract value growth to reaccelerate in Q2, we have to do modestly more than that on a dollar basis year-over-year. Again, if you look at the same number for Q3 where I think Q3 of last year, we did order of magnitude around $100 million of NCVI in the third quarter, we have to do modestly more than that in the third quarter of 2024 to continue the reacceleration. \n And so, again, as we've talked about sort of when we think the reacceleration is going to happen, clearly, the renewal mix -- or the contracts coming up for renewal mix, coupled with our new business, normal expectations, coupled with looking at our pipeline, looking at conversion rates, looking at pipeline velocity, et cetera, that's what gives us confidence that we will see a reacceleration coming off of either the Q1 or the Q2 number. \nJoshua Chan: Great. I guess, on my follow-up on your sales force tenure, how do you think about the idea of the tenure improving into a time when the environment is not yet fully robust? Do you have to work harder on retaining, so that you can fully take advantage of the sales force when the environment does cooperate? How do you think about that? \nCraig Safian: Yes, it's a great question. So obviously, when we talk about average productivity and what we've seen historically, those are generally measured in more \"normal\" operating environment. And so clearly, when it's more challenging from an operating environment perspective, we can see some of the productivity measures or at least the final output productivity measures a little more muted. \n We also measure the inputs that go into sales. And so how many opportunities are being added? How quickly are those things advancing through the pipeline? How often are salespeople and service people interacting with their clients? How many prospects are we getting to webinars or the conferences and things like that? \n So there are other measures beyond just the pure NCVI measure, which is sort of the ultimate measure, but there are other measures that we can look at that give us confidence that our sellers are getting more at that and more experience and are coming up the tenure curve. And then when the economy does stabilize or perhaps even improve, we should be able to see the benefits from that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. \nManav Patnaik: Craig, in your prepared remarks, you made a comment around pricing stabilized, that it could be upside to guidance if it improves. So I was just hoping you could just give a little bit more detail on what the pricing, I guess, year-over-year growth is today versus historical. And were you implying that you guys might be raising prices here again? \nCraig Safian: Manav, just for clarity's sake, the pricing stabilization comment was really specifically about the nonsubscription part of our Research business. And so as you recall, coming out of last year, on our February call, we talked a lot about focusing on higher-quality traffic. And by doing that over the medium to long term, we would expect to see improvements in pricing. \n And so what we saw in the first quarter is some stabilization to pricing, which, again, we view as positive. And as we continue to focus on that higher-quality traffic, if it does convert into better pricing there, that would reflect upside to the existing guidance. \nEugene Hall: And Manav, the pricing in our subscription business has been completely stable, so there's been no issue there. \nManav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. And then just one quick one. I think the enterprise count is down about 4% year-over-year. I'm guessing a lot of that was the tech vendor challenges you talked about. But just in context of your CV acceleration you're expecting, can you just remind us again of your hiring plans for the quota-bearing sales force? \nCraig Safian: Yes. Sure, Manav. Happy to provide that color. So on the enterprise count, your hypothesis is spot on. It's more -- and Gene alluded to this earlier in our prepared remarks. It's just more churn in the small tech space. And again, to Gene's point, we are adding new logos in the small tech space, and we're actually doing pretty well there and holding up pretty well, but it's not offsetting the losses. \n And again, as Gene laid out, the challenges that a lot of these clients had where they had funding 2 years ago, when they sign the contract and obviously may not today. And so that's really the prime story on the enterprise count. \n On headcount growth, we continue to target mid- to high single-digit QBH growth by the end of this year. And again, the combination of the size of the army we had entering the year, people coming up the tenure curve and that mid- to high single-digit growth in QBH should set us up -- or will set us up to continue to accelerate contract value growth rolling into 2025. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. \nSurinder Thind: Just following up on some of the tech vendor questions here. On an absolute dollar basis for CV for tech vendor, is the idea that we're close to stabilizing at this point? Or how should we think about the trajectory over the course of the year as you think about CV growth reaccelerate? So is the primary determinant of that where CV for tech vendor ends up? Or how should we think about that? \nCraig Safian: Surinder, I think it's a combination across the portfolio that will fuel the reacceleration for CV. I mean, clearly, tech vendor needs to be a piece of that. It's about 25% of total CV. \n But we also see opportunity for acceleration across the enterprise function leader portion of our business as well. As Gene highlighted, that continues to grow at around 10% combined, so pretty strong growth in a challenging environment. \n But essentially, I think we believe the -- well, I shouldn't say the tide will lift all three businesses, but all three portions of the CV base should see improvement that lead to the reacceleration of growth. \nSurinder Thind: Got it. But as a clarification, is CV for tech vendor assume to inflect positive at any point in your guidance at this point? \nCraig Safian: Surinder, we generally don't guide around contract value. And so, yes, I can't answer that specifically. All I would say is from either the Q1 or Q2 point, we expect total CV to begin to reaccelerate. And certainly, tech vendor CV will contribute there. \nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on the nonsubscription pricing stabilization. It sounds like it stabilized fairly quickly or in the last few months. Is that a fair characterization? And then could the opposite also happen is how quickly could you potentially see improvement? Is that something that we could start to see in the back half of the year? Or how should we think about the potential for when pricing may reaccelerate or normalize? \nEugene Hall: Yes. Surinder, great question. So the pricing is based on the -- what we're calling the quality of the leads, which is basically the proportion of leads that we send that turn into actual clients. And so -- and analyzing it, we've determined that increasing that proportion actually increases prices. But what happens is you send the vendor the lead, they have to actually close the deals. And so there's a lag time between when you send a better lead and when the pricing goes up. \n And so we certainly -- we believe the pricing will go up as we increase quality leads. Exactly when that happens is hard to predict because of the dynamic I just talked about. The companies actually have to get the leads, close them, realize that they got that business and then reflect that in their pricing. \nOperator: Our next question will come from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. \nKeen Fai Tong: Can you discuss how tech vendor trends performed moving through the quarter in the month of April? Are trends still trying to find the bottom? Have you seen any stabilization? Or are you seeing early signs of a positive inflection? \nCraig Safian: George, I don't think there's anything really to call out month-to-month. I mean, our business, as you know, tends to be very heavily weighted towards the last month of the quarter. And so it's hard to draw inferences or conclusions from Jan to Feb to March, et cetera. \n I guess, all I'd say is we expect that total CV will reaccelerate coming off of either Q1 or Q2. And again, as we just discussed with Surinder, tech vendor will be a piece of that reacceleration. \nKeen Fai Tong: Okay. Got it. And then with respect to margins, you raised your EBITDA margin outlook for the year from 23% to 23.5%. Typically, revenue upside is what drives the margin upside, and expenses are stable at this point. So what's driving your improved margin outlook? And what are your latest thoughts on what normalized EBITDA margin should be? \nEugene Hall: Yes. George, great question. So spot on, on your assessment. I guess, I would say a couple of things. So one is that, clearly, our margins are structurally higher today than they were in 2016 or 2019. As you know, there are a lot of factors that can influence margins on a quarter-to-quarter basis or over the course of the year. \n As it stands right now with coming out of Q1, sort of putting aside foreign exchange for a little bit, we modestly outperformed our expectations or our operating plan on revenue and then had modest upside from an OpEx perspective as well. We have flowed that through the balance of the year, and what you see is a guidance that implies a 23.5% EBITDA margin for the year -- for 2024. \n In terms of how to think about future years, we're only 1 quarter into 2024. We'll give 2025 guidance in February of 2025. But again, a framework or a way to sort of think about it is with the QBH growth that were -- we've got baked into the 2024 plan, we're growing our expenses in high single digits. And that's obviously consistent with our medium-term framework on how we want to run this over the long term to drive long-term sustained double-digit top line growth. \n Obviously, today, with decelerating CV, that puts a little bit of pressure on the margins as the revenue growth is not as great as the expense growth. That said, we're really disciplined around where we're spending and how we manage our expenses. And we're finding that balance between delivering on our margin expectations and making sure that we are investing appropriately to drive future growth. \n And then the last thing I'd say is over the medium to long term, there is operating leverage in the business, and we expect to modestly expand our margins each and every year over the medium to long term. \nOperator: And we will take our last question from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. \nRyan Griffin: This is Ryan on for Jeff. On the renewal activity over the past couple of quarters, can you compare the terms of those renewals to all the new business you signed 2, 3 years ago? In particular, are you seeing greater preference for longer contracts? And then what sort of price escalators are typically embedded in there, if anything worth calling out? \nCraig Safian: Ryan, I'd say it's been pretty stable and normal. So our standard contract is essentially a 2-year contract. I think somewhere around 70% of our contract value are multiyear contracts, 2 or 3 years, but the bulk of them are actually 2-year. \n To your point, we do build price escalators into those multiyear contracts and sort of aligns with what our pricing expectation is when we sign the contract. So think an escalator of between 3% and 5% on the anniversary of those contracts. \n And I'd say in this environment, we're selling roughly same amount of multiyear contracts that we sold 12 months ago or 18 months ago. The team is very focused on continuing to improve that number. It's just -- it's great for our economics, and it's actually great for our clients as well because their challenges are not bounded by a 12-month time frame. \n They're bigger than that. So signing 24-month contracts or 36-month contracts makes sense both from our business model perspective, but almost as importantly, or more importantly, from a client perspective, and that hasn't really changed. \nRyan Griffin: Got it. And then just on the quarterly cadence, what are the meaningful hiring quarters this year? And then just more broadly, how is the hiring market currently for tech talent? \nEugene Hall: So let me start with the tech talent market. So our turnover is very, very low. It's near record lows. And so that's really good for us because it helped increase tenure. On the hiring side, we have a great associate value proposition and a great recruiting team that does an incredible job communicating that value proposition. \n And so we get a lot of demand. Just in the prior report, we get approximately 200 applicants for every single job. And if you benchmark that, that is way off the charts. And so we're a very, very attractive employer. And that looks -- this combination of being a very attractive employer lets us hire great people. And then once we're here, we retain them, which is why we have such low turnover. \n And we work this issue on both the recruiting side and the retention side of our associates. And so that keeps getting better and better over time, which is one of the things that's driving associate tenure up which, in turn, over time, drives productivity up. \nCraig Safian: And then, Ryan, on the timing of the phasing, hiring dates can be -- they can happen on June 29, and they're in the second quarter number or they could happen on July 1 and then they're in the third quarter number. We're very focused on making sure that we hire the right amount of people over the course of this year, so that we enter 2025 with the right number of sellers ready to go. \n And so when we talk about the mid- to high single-digit year-over-year growth in quota-bearing hires across GTS and GBS, that's really a December to December measure. But that's really the most important measure because the people we hire over the course of 2024 don't have a huge impact on 2024. \n But if we have them in seat and trained, with a little bit of experience rolling into 2025, they can actually have a meaningful impact on 2025 and 2026 and beyond. So as you think about the QBH growth of mid- to high single digits, that's really where we want to end the year 2024, so that we're very well positioned as we start 2025. \nOperator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'll now turn the call back over to Gene Hall for any closing remarks. \nEugene Hall: Well, here's what I'd like you to take away from today's call. Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations and 10% contract value growth with enterprise function leaders. We have a vast addressable market opportunity. We have a strong value proposition. \n Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. We'll continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actual objective insights to our clients, prudently investing for future growth, generating free cash flow well in excess of net income and returning capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program. \n Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Eugene Hall",
            "content": "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Gartner remains resilient in a complex environment. In Q1, contract value grew high single digits. Natural results for the quarter were ahead of expectations. We delivered strong profitability and free cash flow, and we increased our guidance for 2024 on an FX neutral basis.  \n The world continues to experience broad geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Higher interest rates and uncertain outlook continue to affect banks. Federal and local governments are struggling to shifting priorities. Inflation remains challenging for companies in many sectors, such as health care. Supply chains continue to be strained. \n We continue to see big shifts in where people work, which is affecting the real estate sector. Cybersecurity continues to be a global and universal threat. And enterprise leaders are just beginning to understand how to leverage artificial intelligence in their organizations.\n Enterprise leaders and their teams know they need help, and they know Gartner is the best source for that help. We provide the insights, tools and advice to drive smart decisions and achieve stronger performance on their mission-critical priorities. Our insights often make the difference between success and failure for the leaders we work with and the enterprises they serve. Gartner guides the leaders who shape the world.  \n Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research business serves enterprises across all major functions in every industry and every geography. Our market opportunity is vast. We deliver unparalleled value to our clients, whether they're thriving, struggling or anywhere in between.  \n In Q1, our clients experienced more challenging macroeconomic conditions, which led to a tougher selling environment. Because of the incredible value we deliver, contract value in our enterprise functional leader business grew 10%. \n Our tech vendor clients continue to be affected by sizable layoffs as well as reductions and shifts in venture capital investments. In addition, we had higher than normal levels of tech vendor contracts up for renewal in Q1, as expected.  \n We guided clients through a wide range of challenging topics, including cybersecurity, supply chain optimization, data analytics, leader and manager development, managing emerging risks, cost optimization and more. Artificial intelligence was a topic with a high level of interest across every business function we serve. \n Gartner serves executives and their teams through distinct sales channels. Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. GTS also serves leaders at technology vendors, including CEOs, Chief Marketing Officers and senior product leaders. GTS contract value grew 5%. GTS contract value with enterprise function leaders grew at high single digits.  \n Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, legal, sales and more. GBS contract value grew 12%.  \n Gartner Conferences deliver valuable insights to a highly engaged audience. We had a great start to the year, including the launch of two new Conferences. The outlook for Conferences remains strong.  \n Gartner Consulting is the extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT Research business. Consulting revenue grew 7%. Labor-based revenue was up 13%. We drove a strong performance in contract optimization against a tough compare.  \n People are at the heart of our business. I just returned from our sales recognition events where I spent time with some of our top performers. Our sales teams are enthusiastic about our prospects for growth in 2024. They love Gartner's strategy, culture and ability to innovate. Gartner is a place where our associates build lifelong careers in sales and beyond.  \n Looking ahead, we updated our guidance for the stronger dollar and increased revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow on a FX-neutral basis.  \n In closing, Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations and 10% contract value growth with enterprise function leaders. Gartner is well positioned for contract value growth to accelerate as we move through the year. Our client value proposition and addressable market opportunity will allow us to drive long-term sustained double-digit revenue growth.  \n We will continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actionable objective insight to our clients, prudently investing for future growth and returning capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. \n We expect margins will expand modestly over time, and we'll continue to generate significant free cash flow well in excess of net income. All of this and more positions us to continue our sustained record of success are into the future.  \n With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. The only thing to add is that our sales to new logos in tech vendors has been strong. And so what Craig reflected is that it's not the new logos that's actually been strong. It's when we have a renewal, how much of -- how many digital seats they buy. Toni, it's Gene. There's a couple of things going on. One is in the small end of the market, the companies that got funding 2 or 3 years ago that are now coming up for renewal, many of those companies are having difficulty getting funding for two reasons. \n One is that the interest rates are higher. The second is there's been a big shift to where venture capitalist want to fund AI. Not surprised that AI start-ups compared to the software start-ups they were funding 2 years ago. And so we're seeing kind of as those come up for renewal, the ones that aren't getting funding don't do as well. And that's why new logos are doing well through selling to the AI start-ups.  \n And then you have the large end of the market, where we have different front going, where they're laying off tens of thousand people. And so they're -- it's a tougher selling environment than it has been in the past.  \n As Craig mentioned, Q1 is our worst quarter in terms of just look at the SKU of renewals in terms of the most -- the largest number of those renewals coming up, and so we expect to get better through the year. So Toni, there's a broad level of interest in AI across each of our functional areas. So whether it's IT, marketing, sales, finance, legal, every single function has a very high interest in AI, and we have a large research team that is focused on making sure we understand the applications in AI in each of those functional areas. And so we have a large installed base of existing clients. Most of those clients are -- the existing clients are looking at our AI research and using it.  \n When we sell to new client, they also -- that's a very hot topic they want to talk to us about it, and it is a good reason to close a sale. If I contrast it though, like 2 years ago, about even cloud computing, that was -- AI wasn't the hot topic, cloud computing was. \n And so the topic has shifted, and it's a very high level of interest, just as cloud computing was 2 or 3 years ago. And so it's not like that we didn't have demand, just all of a sudden increased demand. It kind -- has kind of taken the place of things that were in the past.  \n And again, as we -- and the other thing I'd say is companies are now just kind of trying to figure out whether it's relevant, what the trade-offs are, what the cost is. And I think that this could gather momentum over time as they sort these kinds of things out. \n It's good for us no matter how you look at it. But it's not like we had no business, and this is going to lead to a step change. It's more like it's substituted other things that we're helping with. Again, if you think about the margin over time, it will be a net plus.  \n And with regard to internal usage, we have a number of internal uses that we are using mainly with data analytics, having very sophisticated machine learning algorithms and neural networks in terms of understanding our business. That's one of the big applications we have for it. Heather, let me start. So our -- Q1, our enterprise function leaders CV grew 10%, so it was a little tougher economic environment. Decisions got pushed. We still grew 10% in that kind of environment.  \n The second thing is we talked about the tech sector, we had a -- particularly, we had a lot more renewals from 2 or 3 years ago that's coming up and finishes later in the year. \n And the third thing is if we look at our go-forward sales pipeline, our go-forward sales pipeline is very robust. And so those are the kinds of things that give us confidence that the outlook that we gave is very accurate. The other thing we're doing to Andrew, too, is for some of these existing conferences, we're moving to larger venues, so that we actually can accommodate the incremental demand that we're seeing, which is substantial. And Manav, the pricing in our subscription business has been completely stable, so there's been no issue there. Yes. Surinder, great question. So the pricing is based on the -- what we're calling the quality of the leads, which is basically the proportion of leads that we send that turn into actual clients. And so -- and analyzing it, we've determined that increasing that proportion actually increases prices. But what happens is you send the vendor the lead, they have to actually close the deals. And so there's a lag time between when you send a better lead and when the pricing goes up. \n And so we certainly -- we believe the pricing will go up as we increase quality leads. Exactly when that happens is hard to predict because of the dynamic I just talked about. The companies actually have to get the leads, close them, realize that they got that business and then reflect that in their pricing. Yes. George, great question. So spot on, on your assessment. I guess, I would say a couple of things. So one is that, clearly, our margins are structurally higher today than they were in 2016 or 2019. As you know, there are a lot of factors that can influence margins on a quarter-to-quarter basis or over the course of the year. \n As it stands right now with coming out of Q1, sort of putting aside foreign exchange for a little bit, we modestly outperformed our expectations or our operating plan on revenue and then had modest upside from an OpEx perspective as well. We have flowed that through the balance of the year, and what you see is a guidance that implies a 23.5% EBITDA margin for the year -- for 2024. \n In terms of how to think about future years, we're only 1 quarter into 2024. We'll give 2025 guidance in February of 2025. But again, a framework or a way to sort of think about it is with the QBH growth that were -- we've got baked into the 2024 plan, we're growing our expenses in high single digits. And that's obviously consistent with our medium-term framework on how we want to run this over the long term to drive long-term sustained double-digit top line growth. \n Obviously, today, with decelerating CV, that puts a little bit of pressure on the margins as the revenue growth is not as great as the expense growth. That said, we're really disciplined around where we're spending and how we manage our expenses. And we're finding that balance between delivering on our margin expectations and making sure that we are investing appropriately to drive future growth. \n And then the last thing I'd say is over the medium to long term, there is operating leverage in the business, and we expect to modestly expand our margins each and every year over the medium to long term. So let me start with the tech talent market. So our turnover is very, very low. It's near record lows. And so that's really good for us because it helped increase tenure. On the hiring side, we have a great associate value proposition and a great recruiting team that does an incredible job communicating that value proposition. \n And so we get a lot of demand. Just in the prior report, we get approximately 200 applicants for every single job. And if you benchmark that, that is way off the charts. And so we're a very, very attractive employer. And that looks -- this combination of being a very attractive employer lets us hire great people. And then once we're here, we retain them, which is why we have such low turnover. \n And we work this issue on both the recruiting side and the retention side of our associates. And so that keeps getting better and better over time, which is one of the things that's driving associate tenure up which, in turn, over time, drives productivity up. Well, here's what I'd like you to take away from today's call. Gartner delivered financial results ahead of expectations and 10% contract value growth with enterprise function leaders. We have a vast addressable market opportunity. We have a strong value proposition. \n Looking ahead, we're well positioned to continue our sustained record of success far into the future. We'll continue to create value for our shareholders by providing actual objective insights to our clients, prudently investing for future growth, generating free cash flow well in excess of net income and returning capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program. \n Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you again next quarter."

            "name": "Craig Safian",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning. First quarter financial results were better than planned with particular strength in profitability and free cash flow. We remain well positioned for the global CV growth rate to accelerate from the first or second quarter of this year. We are increasing our revenue, profit and free cash flow guidance on an operating basis and updating for the stronger U.S. dollar. We have a lot of capacity for share repurchases and remain eager to buy back stock opportunistically.  \n First quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, about in line with last year. EBITDA was $382 million, ahead of our guidance and up modestly from first quarter 2023. Adjusted EPS was $2.93, up 2% from Q1 of last year, and free cash flow was $166 million.\n Research revenue in the first quarter grew 4% year-over-year as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. Subscription revenue grew 6% FX-neutral. Non-subscription revenue was similar to Q4 2023 following changes we made during the fourth quarter, which we discussed in February. First quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, consistent with last year. \n Contract value, or CV, was $4.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 7% versus the prior year and down about $10 million from the fourth quarter 2023. The NCVI results reflect the higher-than-normal level of tech vendor contracts up for renewal, which we discussed in February. In addition, Q1 is our seasonally smallest quarter for new business.  \n CV from enterprise function leaders across GTS and GBS grew 10%. CV growth is FX neutral. CV growth outside of our tech vendor client base was broad-based across practices, industry sectors, company sizes and geographic regions. Across our combined practices, the majority of the industry sectors grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates led by the energy, manufacturing and public sectors. \n CV grew double-digit or high single-digit rates across all enterprise sizes except small, which was about flat and has the largest tech vendor mix. We also drove double-digit or high single-digit growth in the majority of our top 10 countries.  \n Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 5% versus the prior year. GTS enterprise leader CV increased high single digits. Tech vendor CV was down slightly year-over-year. GTS CV was $22 million lower than the fourth quarter. \n Wallet retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, which compares to 104% in the prior year. Enterprise leader wallet retention was consistent with historical levels. As expected, tech vendors were the key driver of the change year-over-year.  \n GTS new business was 1% lower than last year, even as enterprise leader new business increased year-over-year. GTS quota-bearing headcount was down 2% year-over-year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit QBH growth by the end of the year. The near-term hiring focus is in the enterprise leader portion of the business. Our regular full set of GTS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.  \n Global Business Sales contract value was $1.1 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 12% year-over-year. All of our GBS practices grew at double-digit or high single-digit rates other than sales, which grew mid-single digits. Growth was led by finance, legal and supply chain. \n GBS CV increased $12 million from the fourth quarter, while retention for GBS was 107% for the quarter, which compares to 110% in the prior year. GBS new business was up 7% compared to last year. GBS quota-bearing headcount was also up 7% year-over-year. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.  \n Conferences revenue for the first quarter was $70 million, modestly ahead of our expectations during a seasonally small period. We had two successful launches in the quarter: our CFO and Finance Executive Conference in Australia; and our Data & Analytics Summit in Brazil. Contribution margin in the quarter was 33%, consistent with typical seasonality and reflecting investments for future growth. We held 12 destination conferences in the quarter.  \n First quarter Consulting revenues increased by 6% year-over-year to $135 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 7%. Consulting contribution margin was 40% in the first quarter. Labor-based revenues were $109 million, up 12% versus Q1 of last year's reported and 13% on an FX-neutral basis. Backlog at March 31 was $188 million, increasing 17% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis with continued booking strength.  \n Our contract optimization business is highly variable. We delivered $26 million of revenue in the quarter against a tough prior year compare. Consolidated cost of services increased 6% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and 5% on an FX-neutral basis. The biggest driver of the increase was higher compensation costs.  \n SG&A increased 5% year-over-year in the first quarter as reported and on an FX-neutral basis. SG&A increased in the quarter as a result of headcount growth and higher compensation costs. \n EBITDA for the first quarter was $382 million, up modestly from last year. First quarter strength compared to our guidance reflected modest revenue upside, effective expense management and a prudent approach to our initial guidance. Depreciation in the quarter of $26 million was up about 10% compared to 2023.  \n Net interest expense, exclusive deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $18 million. This is favorable by $9 million versus the first quarter of 2023 due to higher interest income on our cash balances. The modest floating rate debt we have is fully hedged through the third quarter of 2025. \n The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income was 20% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25% for the quarter.  \n Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2.93, up 2% compared with last year. We had 79 million shares outstanding in the first quarter. This is a reduction of close to 1 million shares or about 2% year-over-year. We exited the first quarter with about 79 million shares on an unweighted basis.  \n Operating cash flow for the quarter was $189 million, up 15% compared to last year. CapEx for the quarter was $23 million, up modestly year-over-year. \n Free cash flow for the quarter was $166 million. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue on a rolling 4-quarter basis was 18% of revenue and 72% of EBITDA. Free cash flow conversion from GAAP net income was 135%. Our free cash flow conversion is generally higher when CV growth is accelerating. \n At the end of the first quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of cash. Our March 31 debt balance was about $2.5 billion. During the quarter, we closed on a new 5-year $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings from the existing credit agreement were rolled over into the new unsecured revolver. The amount drawn remains fully hedged. Our capital structure is now 100% unsecured. After Moody's upgraded our credit in April, we now have three investment grade ratings from Fitch, S&P and Moody's.  \n Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was under 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation, available revolver and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. Our balance sheet is very strong with $1.9 billion of liquidity, low levels of leverage and effectively fixed interest rates. \n We repurchased $225 million of our stock during the first quarter. We expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. At the end of March, we had about $830 million authorized for repurchases. As we continue to repurchase shares, our capital base will shrink. Over time, this is accretive to earnings per share and, combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital.  \n We are raising our full year guidance on an FX-neutral basis to reflect Q1 performance. The dollar has gotten stronger since we reported in February, which is also incorporated into the guidance.  \n For Research, we continue to innovate and provide a very compelling value proposition for clients and prospects. Executives and their teams face uncertainty and challenges, and they recognize how Gartner can help, regardless of the economic environment. \n For Research revenue, based on Q1 results and our outlook for the balance of the year, our guidance on an FX-neutral basis is unchanged. The guidance also reflects the CV growth rate reaccelerating this year. New business strength and improvements in retention would lead to upside to our guidance. And Research subscription revenue growth will likely lag CV growth reacceleration by about a quarter or 2 on an FX-neutral basis.  \n The nonsubscription revenue outlook continues to reflect the shift to higher-quality traffic sources we discussed last quarter. We saw pricing stabilizing over the past few months. An improvement in pricing would represent upside to the guidance.  \n The first quarter for Conferences is seasonally small. We continue to expect strong performance for the full year. We expect similar seasonality to what we saw in 2023 with Q4 the largest quarter, followed by Q2.  \n For Consulting, we continue to see demand on our labor-based services in areas like digital transformation and cost optimization. Contract optimization has had several very strong years and is highly variable. We've incorporated a prudent outlook for this part of the segment.  \n For consolidated expenses, we are investing for future growth, even as we have taken a balanced view of the timing of revenue flowing into the P&L. We recommend thinking about expenses sequentially with notable seasonality driven by the conferences calendar and merit increases. \n As a reminder, about 1/3 of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. With the strengthening dollar, we now expect FX-neutral growth to be higher than reported growth by about 0.5 point for revenue and around a full point for EBITDA for the full year.  \n Our updated 2024 guidance is as follows. We expect Research revenue of at least $5.115 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of about 5%. First quarter results were about in line with our expectations. We updated for the stronger dollar. \n We expect Conferences revenue of at least $560 million, which is FX-neutral growth of about 11%. We expect Consulting revenue of at least $525 million, which is growth of about 3% FX neutral. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $6.2 billion, which is FX-neutral growth of 5%.  \n We now expect full year EBITDA of at least $1.455 billion, up $35 million from our prior guidance before the effect of a stronger dollar. We expect typical operating expense seasonality to continue through the rest of the year. We now expect 2024 adjusted EPS of at least $10.90. \n For 2024, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.08 billion, up $15 million from our prior guidance. The higher free cash flow reflects a conversion from GAAP net income of 139%. Our guidance is based on 79 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which reflects the repurchases made through the end of March. And finally, for the second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA of at least $390 million.  \n Our financial performance started the year ahead of our plan, despite continuing global macro uncertainty and a dynamic tech vendor market. CV grew high single digits in the quarter, and we expect CV growth to reaccelerate from the first or second quarter of this year. \n Revenue and EBITDA performance exceeded our expectations, we increased our operating guidance and incorporated the stronger U.S. dollar into the outlook.  \n Free cash flow was strong in the quarter, and we increased the guidance for the full year. We repurchased about $225 million in stock year-to-date through March and remain eager to return excess capital to our shareholders. We will continue to be price sensitive, opportunistic and disciplined.\n Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing about in line with CV growth and G&A leverage, we will expand EBITDA margins modestly over time. \n We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which will lower the share count over time and on strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.  \n With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Jeff, it's Craig. Thank you for the question. On the new business side, again, you need to really differentiate between what we're seeing from a tech vendor perspective and what we're seeing on the enterprise function leader portion of the GTS business. \n And what we saw was GTS new business for enterprise function leaders was up low single digits year-over-year in the quarter and it was down a little bit year-over-year on the tech vendor side. And so those two dynamics are really what hit us in the first quarter.  \n I would say just on the tech vendor side, and I'm sure we'll talk about this quite a bit as we work through the questions, that we highlighted in February that we had a larger-than-normal amount of contracts coming up for renewal on the tech vendor side. Those were typically 2- or 3-year deals, and so they hadn't been touched in a few years. And obviously, the tech market is very different today than it was a few years ago.  \n And generally, what we're seeing, particularly with our medium to larger-sized tech clients, is they are staying with us, but there is some -- still some recalibration. And what that means is there's less new business than normal on those renewals.  \n Out over the medium term and long term, we expect our tech vendor business to be a 12% to 16% grower, but we're still, and again, you guys can often read the headlines as well as we can, we're still in a pretty challenging tech vendor end market. \n Gene, I don't know if you want to add. Yes. I think, Jeff, it's a great question. We have seen some stability in the retention rates. And generally, if you look at our NCVI in any given quarter, it's a combination of what did we renew and how much new business we sold. \n And with Q1 being a seasonally very small new business quarter, historically, it's always been that way, coupled with the disproportionate amount of tech vendor contracts we had coming up for renewal, the reason we highlighted that in February is because that makes for a tough math, if you will, on NCVI in a given quarter.  \n We are seeing retention rates stabilize. We do see a strong pipeline across the board in both GTS and GBS. And so again, we firmly believe that contract value growth is going to reaccelerate this year, as we indicated in our prepared remarks. And stable retention rates will certainly be an ingredient in that reacceleration. And then, Toni, just for context, the tech vendor CV is a little less than 25% of total CV, which is pretty consistent with where we've been over the last several quarters. Well, I think -- and just to add to that, Heather, our sales force continues to come up the 10-year curve. And so every day, they're a little bit more experienced and a little bit more tenured. And that gives us confidence around the reacceleration. \n And I think also, we are a learning company that are very agile. And even in a tougher environment, we are always working for ways to perform better in that tougher environment. And we learned a lot from prior dislocations. We've learned a lot even from the last couple of quarters, and we were applying those things. And we believe that actually will have a positive impact and help fuel that reacceleration as well. Yes. I mean, it's -- so obviously, it's got to add up to 100% over the course of the year. And so we were a little overweighted in the first quarter on those tech vendor renewals, and it's much more even over the balance of the year. And again, it's another reason that gives us confidence. \n So if you look at the way the renewals work and the way our new business ramps over the course of the year, that's what gives us confidence that either coming off of Q1 or Q2, you will see the reacceleration in the total contract value growth rate. Andrew, I'd say the OpEx favorability was pretty broad based. It wasn't any one particular area where we harvested significant savings. I would say the FX rate actually helped a little bit there, too. It obviously hurts on revenue, but helps on expenses. \n And so we have dialed in the savings in the areas that we saw in Q1. Some of that is timing. Some of that, we're going to catch up on. And some of that is real savings. And so the new guidance reflects what we learned from Q1 from an OpEx perspective. \n But don't overlook the foreign exchange. As we talked about, the dollar has strengthened quite a bit. And about 1/3 of our operating expenses are denominated in currencies outside of the U.S. dollar. And so those pretty large movements can actually impact the reported OpEx and revenue pretty significantly, but again all reflected now in the new guide. Yes. And so that is still the plan, right? Strategy is for us to have destination conference for every major constituency that we serve, role that we serve on every major region or geography in which we operate. And I think the two launches in the first quarter, while small, are indicative of that. \n And so we've expanded our finance, our CFO conferences to Australia in the first quarter, again, sort of building out that portfolio. And we brought back a Data & Analytics Summit in Brazil, again, because we've got a large business in Brazil, and there's demand for data and analytics. \n This year, 2024, we're going from 47 conferences last year to 51 in 2024. I would expect us to have a similar sort of build over the next several years as we continue to build out the Conferences portfolio to support the Research business. Thanks. Josh, so again, I think the combination, as we talked about, of more than normal contracts coming up for renewal against our smallest new business quarter is really -- and the continued tech vendor challenges is really the story around the Q1 NCVI and the Q1 CV growth. \n As you think about moving through the year, the simple way that I think about whether CV growth accelerates or not is just comparing an expectation to your point on what the quarter NCVI is going to be in this year compared to what the NCVI was last year. And so roughly speaking, last year, in the second quarter, we did around $40 million worth of NCVI across GTS and GBS. \n For the contract value growth to reaccelerate in Q2, we have to do modestly more than that on a dollar basis year-over-year. Again, if you look at the same number for Q3 where I think Q3 of last year, we did order of magnitude around $100 million of NCVI in the third quarter, we have to do modestly more than that in the third quarter of 2024 to continue the reacceleration. \n And so, again, as we've talked about sort of when we think the reacceleration is going to happen, clearly, the renewal mix -- or the contracts coming up for renewal mix, coupled with our new business, normal expectations, coupled with looking at our pipeline, looking at conversion rates, looking at pipeline velocity, et cetera, that's what gives us confidence that we will see a reacceleration coming off of either the Q1 or the Q2 number. Yes, it's a great question. So obviously, when we talk about average productivity and what we've seen historically, those are generally measured in more \"normal\" operating environment. And so clearly, when it's more challenging from an operating environment perspective, we can see some of the productivity measures or at least the final output productivity measures a little more muted. \n We also measure the inputs that go into sales. And so how many opportunities are being added? How quickly are those things advancing through the pipeline? How often are salespeople and service people interacting with their clients? How many prospects are we getting to webinars or the conferences and things like that? \n So there are other measures beyond just the pure NCVI measure, which is sort of the ultimate measure, but there are other measures that we can look at that give us confidence that our sellers are getting more at that and more experience and are coming up the tenure curve. And then when the economy does stabilize or perhaps even improve, we should be able to see the benefits from that. Manav, just for clarity's sake, the pricing stabilization comment was really specifically about the nonsubscription part of our Research business. And so as you recall, coming out of last year, on our February call, we talked a lot about focusing on higher-quality traffic. And by doing that over the medium to long term, we would expect to see improvements in pricing. \n And so what we saw in the first quarter is some stabilization to pricing, which, again, we view as positive. And as we continue to focus on that higher-quality traffic, if it does convert into better pricing there, that would reflect upside to the existing guidance. Yes. Sure, Manav. Happy to provide that color. So on the enterprise count, your hypothesis is spot on. It's more -- and Gene alluded to this earlier in our prepared remarks. It's just more churn in the small tech space. And again, to Gene's point, we are adding new logos in the small tech space, and we're actually doing pretty well there and holding up pretty well, but it's not offsetting the losses. \n And again, as Gene laid out, the challenges that a lot of these clients had where they had funding 2 years ago, when they sign the contract and obviously may not today. And so that's really the prime story on the enterprise count. \n On headcount growth, we continue to target mid- to high single-digit QBH growth by the end of this year. And again, the combination of the size of the army we had entering the year, people coming up the tenure curve and that mid- to high single-digit growth in QBH should set us up -- or will set us up to continue to accelerate contract value growth rolling into 2025. Surinder, I think it's a combination across the portfolio that will fuel the reacceleration for CV. I mean, clearly, tech vendor needs to be a piece of that. It's about 25% of total CV. \n But we also see opportunity for acceleration across the enterprise function leader portion of our business as well. As Gene highlighted, that continues to grow at around 10% combined, so pretty strong growth in a challenging environment. \n But essentially, I think we believe the -- well, I shouldn't say the tide will lift all three businesses, but all three portions of the CV base should see improvement that lead to the reacceleration of growth. Surinder, we generally don't guide around contract value. And so, yes, I can't answer that specifically. All I would say is from either the Q1 or Q2 point, we expect total CV to begin to reaccelerate. And certainly, tech vendor CV will contribute there. George, I don't think there's anything really to call out month-to-month. I mean, our business, as you know, tends to be very heavily weighted towards the last month of the quarter. And so it's hard to draw inferences or conclusions from Jan to Feb to March, et cetera. \n I guess, all I'd say is we expect that total CV will reaccelerate coming off of either Q1 or Q2. And again, as we just discussed with Surinder, tech vendor will be a piece of that reacceleration. Ryan, I'd say it's been pretty stable and normal. So our standard contract is essentially a 2-year contract. I think somewhere around 70% of our contract value are multiyear contracts, 2 or 3 years, but the bulk of them are actually 2-year. \n To your point, we do build price escalators into those multiyear contracts and sort of aligns with what our pricing expectation is when we sign the contract. So think an escalator of between 3% and 5% on the anniversary of those contracts. \n And I'd say in this environment, we're selling roughly same amount of multiyear contracts that we sold 12 months ago or 18 months ago. The team is very focused on continuing to improve that number. It's just -- it's great for our economics, and it's actually great for our clients as well because their challenges are not bounded by a 12-month time frame. \n They're bigger than that. So signing 24-month contracts or 36-month contracts makes sense both from our business model perspective, but almost as importantly, or more importantly, from a client perspective, and that hasn't really changed. And then, Ryan, on the timing of the phasing, hiring dates can be -- they can happen on June 29, and they're in the second quarter number or they could happen on July 1 and then they're in the third quarter number. We're very focused on making sure that we hire the right amount of people over the course of this year, so that we enter 2025 with the right number of sellers ready to go. \n And so when we talk about the mid- to high single-digit year-over-year growth in quota-bearing hires across GTS and GBS, that's really a December to December measure. But that's really the most important measure because the people we hire over the course of 2024 don't have a huge impact on 2024. \n But if we have them in seat and trained, with a little bit of experience rolling into 2025, they can actually have a meaningful impact on 2025 and 2026 and beyond. So as you think about the QBH growth of mid- to high single digits, that's really where we want to end the year 2024, so that we're very well positioned as we start 2025."
