My name is Liz, and I will be your conference call coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please proceed, Ms. Newton.\nKris Newton: Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter fiscal year 2021; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder return; and our ability to improve execution gain share, grow our cloud business and evolve our go-to-market strategy and organization, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IT capital spending environment, and our ability to expand our total available market, acquire new accounts, expand in existing accounts, capitalize on our Data Fabric strategy, generate cash flow and execute our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019, including the management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factor sections on our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we get into the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented situation we are all experiencing. First and foremost, I want to express my sympathy for those who have been impacted by COVID-19 and my gratitude to those frontline workers, whose efforts help to keep us healthy and safe. I also want to acknowledge the tremendous amount of work that the NetApp team has done to coordinate efforts around the globe to keep our teams safe, while going above and beyond to be a strong partner to our customers. NetApp is an essential business providing critical infrastructure to vital public health and safety services, first responders, and public sector institutions in battleground cities. We\u2019ve increased our level of support for them, so that they can stay focused on their critical missions. In partnership with Core Scientific, we are giving COVID-19 researchers free access to AI as a service, powered by ONTAP AI and NVIDIA. We are also helping customers rapidly build virtual desktop infrastructure environments to support their growing remote workforce, and to help continue the education of our younger generation, our cloud solutions have been rapidly adopted in the last few weeks alone by many new state, local, and education customers to support VDI for telework and remote classrooms. I\u2019m so proud of the commitment and courage the NetApp team has demonstrated to each other to our partners and customers and to our community. My sincere thanks for all these fantastic efforts. They are representative of NetApp at our very best. Now, let\u2019s turn to the results of the quarter. We continue to make progress in improving our operational execution. By focusing on what we can control, we delivered strong gross margin, cash flow, and operating leverage in Q4 despite the challenging environment. The quarter started off well, and we were tracking to our targets until countries around the globe began going into lockdown. In April, the pace of business slowed significantly and our visibility was reduced. We saw delays in some large deals, while at the same time some companies accelerated orders to get ahead of shutdowns and others initiated new transactions to address the demands of remote working and digital business. Over the course of FY 2020, I\u2019ve outlined our plans to get in front of more buyers and more accounts with our industry-leading portfolio, where we know we can win. Our continued success in our dedicated acquired districts reinforced our decision to maintain the investments to expand our reach, despite the current market uncertainty. In Q4, we achieved our target of adding 200 primary sales headcount one quarter ahead of schedule. This additional sales capacity has enabled us to close coverage gaps and to dedicate resources focused on new customer acquisitions. As a reminder, we funded this headcount by making trade-offs in the business not by adding to the company\u2019s total operating expenses. Additionally, we continued to sharpen our focus on markets, where we have both a significant presence and clear competitive advantage, our storage, and Cloud Data Services businesses. Our File, Block, and Object Storage systems have strong industry and market endorsement from customers, partners, and analysts. We\u2019ve made our solutions easier to consume with Keystone, our reinvention of the customer experience. Keystone gives companies a real path to hybrid multi-cloud IT by delivering a consistent experience and subscription business model in both the biggest public clouds and in company\u2019s data center. We made tremendous progress in our cloud business in FY 2020. As I noted last quarter, we achieved general availability on all the leading cloud providers. NetApp Cloud Volumes is the number one shared file storage platform available in all the public clouds. Our intellectual property is embedded in every region and data center that Microsoft, Google, and Amazon Web Services bring online. We were again named Google Cloud Technology Partner of the Year for Infrastructure. Azure NetApp Files is Microsoft\u2019s shared storage platform for primary workloads, SAP, high-performance computing, database, Windows Virtual Desktop, and the Azure VMware Service. Azure continues to be a good source for new customer acquisition with more than 40% of Azure NetApp Files customers being new to NetApp. Our cloud partners are asking us to expand regional deployments, broaden workload certifications, and invest in go-to-market activities to support this rapidly growing business. Based on the last month of Q4, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to $111 million. We saw growth accelerate through the quarter, as we continue to scale our cloud volume service and more companies turn to cloud to rapidly meet the requirements of remote working and digital business. We are adding new cloud customers and additional data services, such as cloud backup and cloud compliance, which are helping to drive new workloads and increased usage amongst existing customers, and we continue to bring more value to the cloud volumes platform. In the past two months, we acquired Talon, a provider of file caching software for remote and branch office workloads; and CloudJumper, a provider of a virtual desktop in the public cloud. We\u2019ve added these services to our cloud offerings to deliver a comprehensive, modern workplace foundation for all companies from born in the cloud startups in small businesses to the largest global enterprises. We\u2019re excited to include these talented teams in the NetApp family. As we enter into FY 2021, we will continue to manage the business efficiently while focusing on two clear priorities: returning to growth with share gains in our storage business powered by our industry-leading file block and object software and scaling our highly differentiated Cloud Data Services business. We will exploit competitive transitions and the accelerating shift to cloud to expand the usage of our products and services. We will continue to simplify the customer experience by bringing cloud-like flexibility to on-premises environments and deepening the connections between on-premises and cloud, and we will continue to strengthen our partnerships with the cloud providers and add value to our cloud data services, all of which will make it easier for customers to manage data in the hybrid multi-cloud environment and drive preference for our technology. We will also continue to evolve and align our sales and marketing to capture the opportunity ahead. We recently announced that Cesar Cernuda will join NetApp in July as President, leading sales, marketing, services, and support. Cesar has an impressive track record in leading transformations, building diverse high-performing teams, and driving a successful cloud business. He will continue to evolve our go-to-market strategy and operations to transform how we capitalize on the changing customer landscape to drive growth, particularly in cloud. Entering FY 2021, we created a separate globally integrated structure for our cloud data services sales teams, with the sole focus of scaling our Cloud Services business by maximizing our partnerships with the world\u2019s biggest public clouds and helping our customers and partners accelerate their public cloud journey. And as I noted earlier, we have closed coverage gaps with expanded enterprise sales and dedicated customer acquisition teams to further strengthen our position in the storage market. Data has always been central to the work we do. And the role of data is more important now than ever before. The resilience of our society and of our financial, governmental, educational and healthcare systems depends on the reliable safe and flexible access, storage and management of data. That is our vision. CEOs are prioritizing the ability to deliver services and products remotely to reach customers through digital means and to optimize remote operations and collaboration. It is critical to have an integrated IT architecture, especially for data. With our Data Fabric strategy, we help customers tackle these challenges by modernizing legacy infrastructure and simplifying the integration and orchestration of data services, so that they can rapidly respond to a changing environment and fuel innovation. While we cannot predict when the world will return to normal, the enduring importance of data is clear. We are confident that the demand for our products and services will be strong as we emerge from this crisis. The strength and resiliency of our business model enables us to continue to execute our strategy while navigating a range of demand environments. We will continue to make prudent decisions in the face of the current reality, focusing on the priorities that will enable us to return to growth. We will also maintain operational discipline and ensure that our strong balance sheet will support our ability to create long-term shareholder value through a wide range of scenarios. We are focusing our resources on the solutions that lead to the highest returns, storage and cloud data services. We are broadening our reach with a dedicated cloud sales focus, expanded enterprise sales coverage and dedicated customer acquisition resources. I\u2019m confident that these actions position NetApp to emerge from the current health crisis stronger than ever. We will host an Analyst Day on September the 16th, where we will share more information on our plans for the continued evolution of NetApp and a multi-year business outlook. We hope that you\u2019ll be able to join us. Finally, I\u2019m happy to introduce Mike Berry, our new Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019m excited to have Mike and his deep knowledge of the technology and software industry on the team. He will be a key partner, as we strengthen our leadership position in hybrid cloud data services and deliver long-term shareholder value. Mike\u2019s first day coincided with our local shelter in place order. Despite the unique start, he has quickly integrated into the company and he is already making an impact. Mike, welcome.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George, and thanks for that wonderful introduction. First, I also want to express my sympathy to all those who have been impacted by the current health crisis and extend my sincere gratitude to the selfless frontline workers who put themselves in harm\u2019s way to help keep us all safe. The COVID-19 pandemic has made for a very interesting first 60 days for me at NetApp, but the unusual circumstances have only reinforced my initial views of the strong NetApp culture. I have been very impressed with the quality of the team and the level of collaboration and commitment across the entire organization. From day one, it has been clear that this team is all pulling in the same direction with a high level of transparency and accountability and a tireless determination to continue serving our customers across the globe. When you couple this with NetApp\u2019s business model, loyal customer base, go-to-market engine and product development, we are positioned to do great things in the future. Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation to George and the entire Board for giving me this opportunity and to Ron for his help during my unusual onboarding. I\u2019m extremely excited about joining NetApp and look forward to working alongside George and the rest of the talented team, as we continue to drive innovation in data management. In the current environment, it is important to highlight NetApp\u2019s solid liquidity position and business model. NetApp\u2019s healthy balance sheet and considerable free cash flow generation provide us the ability to make strategic decisions that are best aligned with long-term shareholder value. This is particularly critical in times of uncertainty. We closed Q4 with $2.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. As of year-end, we also had approximately $500 million available through our credit facility. And we are confident, we have access to the corporate debt market, if needed. Our strong liquidity position has allowed us to provide extended credit programs to our channel partners during the health crisis. Given this is my first call as NetApp\u2019s CFO, I wanted to walk through how I view capital allocation. Our strong liquidity position and the fact that we generated roughly $1 billion of free cash flow last year, allow us to remain committed to our dividend, which now carries more than a 4% yield. In fiscal 2020, we paid out nearly 50% of our free cash flow to dividends. In the current environment, we believe it is prudent to pause our share repurchase program, which we did in late March, until we have a better sense for the timing and magnitude of the broader economic recovery. Longer-term, share repurchases will play a key role in our capital allocation strategy, with the goal to have buybacks at least offset dilution from our equity plans. Consistent with NetApp\u2019s long history of disciplined M&A, our acquisition strategy will remain focused on bolstering our strategic roadmap, particularly within our Cloud Data Services business. Of course, all of these uses of capital will be balanced against reinvesting in the business for future growth. Before going through our Q4 and fiscal 2020 results, I would like to remind you that I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Despite the demand weakness, logistical challenges and minor supply constraints as a result of COVID-19, we delivered strong gross margins, healthy operating leverage and substantial free cash flow in the fourth quarter. In Q4, net revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 12% year-over-year, including nearly 1 point of currency headwind. It is worth highlighting that our two key strategic focus areas, our Storage business, powered by our industry-leading File, Block and Object Software and Cloud Data Services, both performed considerably better than the rest of the business. Our all-flash revenue of $656 million was down 3% year-over-year. We continue to believe that there is a very healthy runway for all-flash adoption, as only 24% of our installed systems are all-flash. Cloud data services delivered $111 million in ARR, growing 113% year-over-year and an impressive 34% sequentially. Cloud data services customer count now exceeds 3,500, more than doubling from Q4 of last year. Total product revenue of $793 million decreased approximately 21% year-over-year. ELA revenue in Q4 was less than $10 million. Given that ELAs represents such a small portion of our business, we will not be breaking out ELA revenue in future quarters. As you know, over the last year, the timing and magnitude of ELAs has proven extremely difficult to predict. In an effort to have a more predictable forecast, be more conservative and reduce confusion, we will not be including ELAs and guidance going forward. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $546 million, was up nearly 4% year-over-year. These two recurring revenue lines comprise roughly 40% of total net revenue. Going forward, we will focus a lot more on our high-margin recurring revenue streams, where renewals play a big role in growth. I have been incredibly impressed with the work the team has done around renewals, implementing a much more rigorous sales motion and simplified quoting system. We ended Q4 with $3.7 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Gross margin of 68%, was up nearly 3 points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 56.4%, an increase of over 1 point year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by an increase in all-flash product mix. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services continues to be an incredibly profitable business for us, with gross margin of 83.2%, which was up 1 point year-over-year. The margin expansion was mainly driven by continued leverage in our support model. Q4 operating expenses of $629 million, decreased approximately 8% year-over-year, driven by lower variable compensation associated with the shortfall in revenue. Operating margin was 23.1%, up more than a 0.5 point from Q4 of last year. EPS of $1.19, was down 2% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $383 million and free cash flow was $359 million, representing 26% of revenue. During Q4, we repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $49.50, for a total of $161 million. As of the end of Q4, we had $478 million remaining on our original $4 billion buyback authorization. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $222 million, down 27 million shares year-on-year, representing an 11% decrease. During the quarter, we paid out $105 million in cash dividends. We will maintain our cash dividend of $0.48 per share in Q1. Turning to our full-year 2020 results. Net revenues of $5.4 billion decreased 12% year-over-year, including a 0.5 point of currency headwind. Gross margin of 67.9%, was up nearly three points compared to fiscal 2019. Operating margin of 20.8% decreased nearly 2 points versus fiscal 2019, due to lower-than-anticipated revenues. EPS of $4.05, decreased 10% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $936 million in fiscal 2020, which represented 17% of net revenues. We completed $1.4 billion in share repurchases and $439 million in dividends in the fiscal year. And over the last three years, we have returned $5.4 billion to shareholders. Now onto guidance. As you all know, demand visibility has been significantly impacted by COVID-19. As a result, we are not guiding the full-year at this time. We will reassess our ability to provide fiscal 2021 guidance after Q1. With that as a backdrop, we did think it was important to provide boundaries to the demand scenarios we are seeing in the near-term. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.09 billion and $1.24 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a 6% decline in revenues year-over-year, including 1.5 points of currency headwind. We expect consolidated gross margin to range between 67% and 68% and operating margin to be approximately 10%. Assumed in this guidance, our Q1 operating expenses of $660 million to $670 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19% and expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $0.36 and $0.44 per share. As a reminder, Q1 has an extra week this year, which adds approximately $30 million to $35 million to both our recurring revenues and total operating expenses for the quarter. The incremental revenue and expenses largely offset each other at the operating income level and thus have minimal impact to EPS. A quick comment on our go-forward expense structure. As George highlighted, we invested in our go-to-market engine by adding 200 primary sales resources over the last three quarters. And we did this without adding incremental dollars to our operating expense envelope. At this time, we have decided not to make any significant structural changes to our expense base until we have better visibility into the duration and magnitude of the current downturn. We continue to closely monitor the situation, which will likely remain very fluid over the next two to three quarters. As we look forward to fiscal 2021, I did want to highlight two key strategic goals for the year. Our cloud connected all-flash portfolio continues to offer customers a unique architecture that bridges on-prem and public cloud environments under a singular ONTAP software platform. While the shape of the economic recovery will largely determine the overall growth rate for the storage industry, our goal for fiscal 2021 is to reestablish share gains in the storage market. In the coming year, we will also continue to grow and invest in our Cloud Data Services business. Fiscal 2020 was a foundational year in launching both Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Volumes Service across AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. We also acquired two great assets in Talon and Cloud Jumper, expanding the breadth of our cloud data services platform and adding nicely to our overall cloud TAM. We remain confident in cloud data services unique market position. Partner and customer feedback has only reaffirmed our confidence in the size of the opportunity. But to be prudent, we thought best to reset expectations around the ARR ramp, so we are removing the fiscal 2021 target for Cloud Data Services ARR of $400 million to $600 million. We will provide new guidance and trackable metrics for our Cloud Data Services business at our Analyst Day in September. Fiscal 2021 will serve as a critical growth year for the Cloud Data Services franchise, which will be aided by a new dedicated cloud data services sales force. In closing, I want to thank our partners, customers and investors for their continued support. And a special thank you to the NetApp employees for stepping up during this global crisis. It is clearly a unique time to be joining NetApp. I see real opportunity to add value as our business continues to evolve with a clear goal of driving significant long-term value for our shareholders. As George noted, we are planning to host an Analyst Day in September, which will provide a great overview of our strategic initiatives and include an update to our long-term financial model. I\u2019ll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBala Reddy: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. This is Bala Reddy on for Rod. Could you give us some color on demand trends that you\u2019re seeing across different geographies and maybe color on how the order trends have been in the past four weeks in this month, and I\u2019ve got a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: I think if you look across the geographies, the order trends somewhat followed the impact of COVID across the world. I think our Asia Pacific business was first impacted by COVID, particularly in the areas surrounding China. I think we\u2019ve seen that part of the business come back online. Through the course of the quarter, as we said in our prepared remarks, we felt that we were on target until the impact of COVID started to broaden across the globe, and we saw several different things going on. Some customers pulled forward transactions so that they could deploy and be ready before the shelter-in-place took full impact. Others clearly, either deferred transactions or downsized transactions, our supply chain performance was strong. Thanks to some really good work done by our supply chain team. And so, we were able to meet most of the orders that customers wanted within the course of their requirements. From a vertical market perspective, as I said, we cover a broad range of industries, and so there is no single geography or industry that has a material part of our business. I think that when we look at the results from the quarter, financial services and healthcare were strong performers. Automotive, retail meaning traditional retail and oil and gas were weaker through the course of the quarter. And similarly, oil dependent economies were challenged through the course of the quarter.\nBala Reddy: Thanks, George. Maybe some color on how the trends have been in the past four weeks in this month?\nGeorge Kurian: I think, as I said, they were \u2013 we had less visibility into order trajectory in the last four weeks than in the first couple of months, the periods of the couple of months of the quarter. I think, as we look into the \u2013 where we are today, there\u2019s isn\u2019t material change from that, which is why we are being cautious about providing guidance a quarter at a time. I\u2019m trying to be cautious in the commentary around our guidance itself. Mike, do you want to add anything?\nMike Berry: No, that\u2019s it. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you could help bridge the gross margin guidance, and maybe there\u2019s a volume aspect or cost aspect. But I guess, fundamentally, I would believe that we\u2019d see services increasing in the mix. They have good gross margin, and maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s throwing me. On-premises, the mix shift should help gross margin. So, I\u2019m wondering what the offset is?\nMike Berry: Yes, Simon, it\u2019s Mike Berry. So, if you look year-over-year, that\u2019s exactly what you do see. I would always encourage you because of seasonality to look year-over-year as it relates to gross margin. So, when you look at total, the slight increase, we get \u2013 you get a little benefit in Q1 year-over-year from the 14th-week, so you have to take that into account. But then the higher mix of services at 80%-plus drives the total gross margin up as it relates to year-over-year, and again seasonality will have a significant influence if you look sequentially, and that\u2019s just not as applicable as the year-over-year numbers.\nSimon Leopold: Great. And then just as a follow-up. You did mention financing available for some of your partners. And I have a perception NetApp has been less vocal on financing for customers than some of the large IT peers. Just wondering if maybe you could elaborate on how you may be adjusting your financing program to help customers and not just your channel partners? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We have a broad range of capabilities to meet customers\u2019 needs for OpEx kinds of business models and cash preservation concerns. They range, of course, from cloud data services, which are available on all the leading public cloud platforms, and we saw several customers take advantage not only of the flexibility that the cloud data services portfolio had, but also the rapid time to provision. We have introduced a program called Keystone, which is a subscription offering for enterprise data centers, and we saw some strong wins in that part of our business, as well as a healthy pipeline. And then clearly, we work with partners through managed service offerings, which are typically on a monthly basis payment model. And we have third parties we work with around traditional leasing models for customers. I\u2019m happy to have Mike comment further.\nMike Berry: Yes. I think there\u2019s two parts what George walked through as well as just giving extended terms to some of our channel partners as they deal with our end users, and our financial flexibility also helps us their assignment.\nSimon Leopold: Great. Thank you for taking the questions.\nKris Newton: All right. Thank you, Simon. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTim Long: Thank you. I was hoping to talk about the cloud data services a little bit. Your numbers do look like some acceleration in the quarter. Just curious about kind of the pulling the longer-term guidance, if we could just get some color around, why maybe the uptake has been a little bit slower? It does seem like you\u2019ve hit most of the GA targets at the big players and the move to cloud obviously is accelerating as you highlighted in the quarter. So maybe just give us a little bit of color as to why you think has that been just a more difficult sell to customers or harder for the sales force? If you can just give us some color on what\u2019s affected the slope of that curve? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: First of all, we feel even more bullish today about the demand for our offerings than we did a year ago. I think that over the last year, as Mike mentioned, we have added a substantial number of customers more than doubled our customer base and there are a lot of net new customers coming to NetApp. We have, as we mentioned, been a year behind where we needed to be in terms of getting the services to general availability. And we still have \u2013 we are still working to get through a completely frictionless sales model together with Microsoft, for example. So there\u2019s really good work being done. We are expanding the number of use cases. We\u2019ve got more data centers being deployed, but we are about a year behind where we felt we would be and that\u2019s been our consistent commentary even in the last quarter. I\u2019ll let Mike comment with regard to the guide.S\nMike Berry: Yes. Tim, so as George mentioned, we feel really good about the business. Nice growth in Q4, sequential growth. So it doesn\u2019t reflect us not \u2013 our confidence level. As he mentioned, we\u2019re a little bit behind where we were in the original guide was done. And I would like to be able to address that, as well as kind of the long-term model all at once in September. Hence, we didn\u2019t want to update it now and not do the rest of the business. So that\u2019s why we said, \u201cHey, we will address all of that as it relates to the business when we get together, hopefully in person or virtually in September.\nTim Long: Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll just keep it at the one.\nKris Newton: All right. Thank you, Tim. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thank you. I guess, following up on the cloud data services and the fact that you saw a fairly big chunk of new customers adopting that platform. Is there a cross-selling opportunity in terms of those customers adopting on-premise hardware and services from you? Or is that a different customer base?\nGeorge Kurian: There\u2019s clearly a set of those customers who have never bought anything from NetApp. Some of those customers are truly digital natives, meaning, they don\u2019t have the concept of an enterprise data center. And there, the cross-sell and up-sell is for the vast majority of those customers. We have a very narrow slice today of their total cloud wallet, meaning, in terms of workloads and we can expand there. Many of the customers also have enterprise data centers. And so our discussions with them are obviously, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re going to use us on the public cloud, why couldn\u2019t you be able to deploy us in your data center?\u201d I\u2019ll give you an example. There\u2019s a several large global companies who have us as a second vendor, not the primary vendor in their enterprise data center, but we are their primary shared platform in the public cloud. They are now giving us a broader range of opportunities in the enterprise data center. So as the COVID crisis abates and we see enterprise data centers being more \u2013 being expanded, we\u2019ll see more share of footprints, at least, that\u2019s our confident belief.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s it for me.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. George, we\u2019re obviously in an unprecedented period of disruption at the macro level, but you are advantaged by a strong balance sheet. So would love to get your thoughts as to whether there\u2019s an opportunity for you to press your advantage and perhaps make some larger investments or do more M&A than you have in the past that come out of this period stronger?\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Katy. I think when we look at the overall profile of our business, we have, as you mentioned, a really strong margin profile in terms of gross margins, reflecting the rich software contribution to our business. I think, as Mike mentioned in terms of capital allocation, we are going to continue to support the dividend at the current level going forward. The place where we will have to reevaluate that is if we see some structural impairment to our free cash flow, which we don\u2019t see at the moment. So we\u2019re going to continue to stay with the dividend. We have hit a pause on the buybacks. We\u2019ve done a lot of buybacks over the last couple of years, almost $3.5 billion, and so we\u2019re going to pause that until we have better visibility into the overall landscape. And we are going to be selective, but we continue to see opportunities to expand our strategic relevance and the portfolio, like you mentioned. So we\u2019re going to continue to balance all of these cases. I would tell you that as we think about the go-forward strategic roadmap, it\u2019s much more tied to software and cloud services. We\u2019re not leaning towards doing horizontal consolidations for scale. I think that, that would not be a primary focus for us.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Katy. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. George, I was wondering if you could just sort of talk about how you\u2019re going to approach some of the vendor incentives you\u2019re providing against the backdrop of having so many industries with uncertain demand? How do you sort of make sure you\u2019re deploying that capital correctly without maybe unnaturally pulling forward revenues? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think we have a good handle on the customer discussions that we are engaged in. As I mentioned, one of the areas that we invested in without raising the overall operating expense level of the company was to put primary demand generation, account executives facing customers. So we have a good close dialogue with these customers. For those that want to be able to take advantage of technology without having to deploy large amounts of cash, we are uniquely positioned in the market because of our cloud data services portfolio. They are instantly provisionable. They have the reach and scale of the world\u2019s biggest hyperscale data centers, and in many ways, also allow customers to start their journey on the cloud. That would be our lead offer, right? I think with regard to subscription services and other use cases, we are selective. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re trying to say that at this point in time that we are going to transition our entire business over to a subscription model. I think we need to have that in our portfolio and we\u2019ll have it, but we are selective about qualifying, which customers we provide subscription offerings to.\nSteven Fox: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Steve. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. George, expanding on your comments on the sales addition, can you give us a sense of the 200 additions, how they\u2019re ramping the productivity and maybe how trends have been in North America?\nGeorge Kurian: I would tell you that, as we said, we were going to bring on 200 primary demand generation headcount, starting from the beginning of Q2 of FY 2020 through the end of Q1 of FY 2021, which is the current quarter. We have accomplished that objective a little bit ahead of plan. We are in the process of enabling those sales headcount. I would tell you they typically, as we have said before, take three to four quarters to get up to full productivity and we feel good about the work they\u2019re doing so far. I think that we\u2019ve also said that we would focus them on new customer acquisition, some on cloud and clearly on the strongest places in our portfolio, which is our all-flash arrays and our object storage and they have seen good results in the second-half of this year. So as we have started to deploy and focus these resources, we are starting to see some good underlying trends in the business.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, George. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes. I wanted to focus on public sector. First, just a clarification and then a question. I\u2019m pretty sure public sector includes healthcare, but just to clarify that? And then secondly, what are you seeing in pipeline? I\u2019m particularly interested in healthcare with regards to elective procedures impacting their budgeting cycles. And then within SLED, maybe the tentative budgets with higher ed, government revenue issues. Just focus for a moment if you would on the public sector for me?\nGeorge Kurian: Not all of our healthcare business is categorized as public sector. Certainly, there are pieces of it like University Hospitals, State University Hospitals that are in public sector, but not the whole business, right? I think, if I look at healthcare overall, there were \u2013 we had a lot of customer wins because of the strength of our solutions for digital imaging, the advancements that we are doing with NVIDIA around AI for imaging, and there are lots of unique technologies in our ONTAP operating system that enables that type of a workflow to be really successful. The second is, with regard to the healthcare customer base, we\u2019ve also stepped up our support for them. I think they are highly stressed that the amount of work, so I don\u2019t think there was any sort of budgetary issue we saw. It was really just the capacity of work they are doing to sustain their patient levels and the sort of the level of work that they\u2019re sort of patient-facing workforce has. I think that\u2019s really about healthcare. With regard to the public sector, again, we have a broad book of business, covering both federal, state and local, government and education. Within education, we saw several customer wins around the rapid movement of that part of our world to a remote working, remote education model. And so both our private cloud solutions and certainly our public cloud, modern workplace solutions benefited from that move. I would tell you that visibility is \u2013 it\u2019s choppy, right? It\u2019s across the board. It\u2019s a little choppy. I think in our public sector business, we had a couple of deals that did not close within the quarter, just because of the logistics of being able to try to bring teams together to close the transaction.\nEric Martinuzzi: And then, as far as the guidance, that\u2019s captured in the guidance across all three of that?\nGeorge Kurian: That\u2019s correct.\nEric Martinuzzi: Got it. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Eric. Next?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. George, you mentioned your sales force ramping, which is quite impressive, which is good. I had a plan and such like that. I\u2019m just wondering in the COVID-19 environment, which nobody anticipated, does it make it harder or still the same to regain share and efforts? I\u2019m thinking about you have all the new persons and hims in hers in place. Are they able to start now out there cracking into some new companies and new market shares? Or does this \u2013 congratulations, you\u2019re ahead of plan, but the coronavirus makes it a little harder to keep knocking on doors and get new design wins. Just wondering about how we sort this all out, because it seems like you\u2019re really ahead of plan now?\nGeorge Kurian: I think that if you think about the coronavirus as a \u2013 as an opportunity to disrupt, you can lean into these conversations with customers, right? One of the things that we see with the use of remote working tools is that our sales teams can bring the best of NetApp to any customer anywhere in the globe. Meaning, they can bring the CEO now on any given day to a discussion in Asia, Europe and North America, all in the course of a single day. That wasn\u2019t possible in the old world, right? So, we are trying to lean into the changes. As I said, we feel good about the progress of our acquired districts, which was a key place that we were targeting some of our headcount. Even in Q4, they had good performance. We have been focused on the cloud business as a place to continue to ramp our success that had good results. And I think that you should expect from us and as we have demonstrated over the past several years, we are disciplined operators, right? So if we don\u2019t see a return on that investment, we\u2019ll certainly look to do something else with it. And so you should expect Mike and I to stay focused on the evolving nature of the market and we\u2019ll adjust accordingly.\nJim Suva: Thank you for the details and explanation. It\u2019s greatly appreciated. Thank you,\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Jim.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Jim. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Cabral: Thank you very much. Given the softer demand environment, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about if you\u2019ve seen any changes in terms of pricing or other competitive behavior since the middle of March?\nGeorge Kurian: No, I think that the strong gross margin profile of our business is reflective of both the discipline of our sales force, as well as the differentiation of our products. I think we have an extraordinarily good technology portfolio. As I said, in the Storage business, we have the leadership position, not second, not third, the leadership position in five block object technologies, which is the full range and we have uniquely differentiated cloud data services. So, yes, the market is always competitive. But I think that, as we have demonstrated over several quarters now, product gross margins continue to be an area of focus for us. We have incented the sales force to stay disciplined around discounting, and you saw that through the quarter, and we\u2019re going to take it a quarter at a time and keep staying disciplined around that. Mike, you want to end?\nMike Berry: No, nothing more.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa. Your line is now open.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay, thank you. As you look at how you\u2019ve been able to get your people to work from home with COVID-19, and you don\u2019t have to be given guidance here. But do you see any long-term changes that you will make this actually something more permanent? And then in the long run, would that actually change some of your cost structure either for some of your real estate or anything else? Any thoughts here would just be interesting and helpful? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think, first of all, I want to thank the NetApp team. I\u2019m \u2013 I could never have been more proud than what I saw from our team this past quarter. Across the board, we started our planning to deal with the COVID crisis in January when we first saw the impact in China. And as a result of working from home has been pretty seamless on everything from engineering deliverables to the incredible work that our support team and our supply chain teams have done, we have for the most part being able to operate without disruption. I think the place that we are continuing to focus in on is the ability to engage customers through a digital medium. And I think that we are new to it just like everybody else, right, but we see opportunity there. I think with regard to the long-term model, it\u2019s a little bit early to tell. I think we are certainly cautious about returning our workforce to the office. I think we\u2019re going to do it step wise with the priority being the safety of our employees. And so we see that it will be a hybrid model with a large percentage of our employees working in at home or other flexible locations of their choice. And we\u2019ll factor that over time as it settles into what the new normal looks like. We\u2019re certainly going to factor that in over time into what we can do to best serve our employees and customers.\nMike Berry: And on that, Lou, it\u2019s Mike. I would just add, to George\u2019s point, it\u2019s all about making sure our employees are safe and dealing with it now. As you look forward, companies have a lot of areas to look into, be it real estate, be it travel, marketing events. What does that mean for the sales team? But I think it\u2019s way too early for us to be able to tell that. We need to figure out how this goes over the next, call it, several months or quarters, and then a lot of companies will be asking those very questions.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay. And good luck with the new job.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Lou. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Two follow-ups. George, with four consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline in all-flash array. Do you think the worst is behind us and we should see a rebound and hopefully a year-over-year growth sooner than later? And I have a follow-up?\nGeorge Kurian: It\u2019s difficult for me to give you specific guidance, given the volatility of COVID. I will tell you that our all-flash SaaS business, which is the predominant part of our all-flash array business has started to perform much better as we have driven focus and as we have driven enterprise sales coverage. That doesn\u2019t show the overall all-flash array number yet. But the trends underneath the all-flash array numbers are much healthier than what the overall number shows. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. And I think we\u2019re going to stay focused, as we\u2019ve said, on exploiting our position there and getting it back to growth. From an installed base perspective, it is still a small percentage, right? So all-flash installed base is at 24%. So we got a long way to go. And so we\u2019re going to stay focused on using all the levels that are disposal to gain share.\nMehdi Hosseini: Sure. Great. Thanks for detail. And I have a follow-up. It seems to me that certain aspect of work from home is going to be permanent with us. And in that context, virtualization of VDI is going to be in a secular demand. You\u2019ve recently made an acquisition here. How should I think about this specific sector? And how do you expect that to grow for you? There has been a lot of emphasis on all-flash array, cloud data services. But I think that you\u2019re doing something in VDI, and I want to hear more and maybe you can quantify it for us? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. As part of our cloud data services portfolio, what we said consistently is, we\u2019re going to get the fundamental infrastructure into the \u2013 into all the major hyperscalers, which is our cloud volumes platform. We were then going to add data services on top of that, and we\u2019ve added several organically built backup and data protection services. We\u2019ve done cloud governance and compliance services. And now what we are doing is, we are building out a modern workplace solution that combines a global file consolidation solution that we acquired in Q4 called Talon and a virtual desktop infrastructure and desktop as a service solution provider called Cloud Jumper that we acquired in Q1 of fiscal year 2021. The combination of cloud volumes, Talon and Cloud Jumper, gives us an extremely strong offering in the market. And it\u2019s particularly suited to the broad transition of virtual desktop services to what we see as Windows virtual desktop, which is a new offering created by Microsoft to enable customers to have much more efficient virtual desktop infrastructures on the Azure cloud. And so you\u2019ll see us tell you more about that in the coming quarters, but we\u2019re really excited and we saw some significant customer wins. Cloud Jumper had been a longstanding partner of NetApp, and we had worked together with them to do many cloud deals before and now that they are integrated into NetApp. We think that, that should accelerate our business further.\nMehdi Hosseini: Great. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mehdi. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nNehal Chokshi: Thank you, and congrats on a what I think is a good quarter, given the conditions. On the high-end of the guidance that appears rather bullish, where part of revenue goes from negative 20% in the most recent quarter to probably around flattish year-over-year. So what are you seeing that underpins this rather strong uptick in that year-over-year growth profile?\nMike Berry: Yes. So this \u2013 Nehal, this is Mike. So a couple of things on that. Keep in mind that, that in revenue, mix matters a lot. We do get 30 to 35 from the extra week that\u2019s in the revenue numbers. So if you look year-over-year, take that into account. And then in Q1, because the product revenue from a seasonal perspective is lower. This is where the strength of our recurring revenue comes in as well. So that, that helps us also on that range. So that\u2019s really how we got to that, call it, high-end of the guidance range, really driven by the mix, the strength of recurring revenue and then the benefit from the 14th-week.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. So then the follow-on there is on the low-end of the guidance, does that embed a deterioration in the macro?\nMike Berry: So I have George talked about, it\u2019s really a continuation of what we saw in the latter part, call it, of our Q4. So it assumes that what we saw in April and later March continues into Q1.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Nehal. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.\nNikolay Todorov: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. On the cloud data services, what sort of incentives do you have for customers that have adopted cloud data services to increase their NetApp consumption on-prem? And also related to that, I think CDS and on-prem buyers within the same customer, two distinct departments. Can you talk about how and if the sales cycle of cross-selling on-prem systems to CDS customers is different, if at all?\nGeorge Kurian: I don\u2019t think, first of all, some of the CDS customers are acquired through Microsoft. And so incentive that are provided to those customers are really provided by Microsoft to deploy those workloads on the Azure Cloud, right? I think with regard to cross-selling them to an on-prem environment, it really is more of a relationship and a customer confidence discussion rather than a specific kind of incentives \u2013 commercial incentives. I\u2019ll give you an example. We are certified to run SAP on both the Google Cloud as well as the Azure Cloud. And many customers use \u2013 are starting to use SAP on those cloud provider platform with NetApp. They may not run their entire SAP environment on those clouds. They may run a portion of it, for example, analytics or business intelligence or something like that. And so we get to go and tell them listen, you\u2019re using SAP on Azure, on NetApp and you like the technology and the benefits. Why wouldn\u2019t you use us for your transaction processing environment on-premise? So it\u2019s more of a relationship and a customer confidence and awareness of benefit we get in specific incentives.\nNikolay Todorov: Okay. Just if I can sneak one more, I think, it\u2019s important. You talked about moving to a frictionless sales model, especially with Microsoft. Can you please elaborate a little bit on that?\nGeorge Kurian: Today, we have, given the importance of the workloads that we serve, these are production environments that we support in customers. We have a, what we call whitelisting requirements with Microsoft. So there\u2019s essentially, the customer has to register with a Microsoft website that then creates a manual provisioning step where NetApp has to call the customer and make sure that that\u2019s \u2013 customers ready to go live. I think as we have scaled the business, we are working closely with Microsoft to remove that requirement, so that we can automatically provision workloads on to NetApp Cloud Volumes. And we\u2019re looking forward to that when that happens. There\u2019s still work to be done, but both teams are working actively to remove that requirement.\nNikolay Todorov: Got it. Thanks. Good luck, guys.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Nik. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. I\u2019m not to stay on the cloud topic too much. But I\u2019m just curious, given the focus, how much are you thinking what you\u2019re going to be doing in the coming few quarters, is going to be acquisition versus partnerships versus internal development? I\u2019m just trying to get a handle on exactly how you\u2019re really thinking about expanding cloud, or if it\u2019s more of just taking what you\u2019ve got now and expanding the sales of it? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We\u2019ve always been pretty disciplined about the uses of cash. We\u2019re going to continue to do that. I think where we do acquisitions, we are very selective. We spend a lot of time to make sure that both strategic and cultural fit, as well as financial benefits to our shareholders over time. So we\u2019re going to continue to stay disciplined on acquisitions. I think with regard to the cloud portfolio itself, the vast majority of our cloud revenue today is through organic development. We feel that we have taken \u2013 unlike anyone else in the industry, taken the world\u2019s best storage and data management operating system, made it cloud enabled and integrated it into every major data center of the world\u2019s three biggest public cloud. And not only that, two of the big three are actually selling it as their own service. And that has been the big amount of work we\u2019ve done. Now that, that foundation is in place and starting to scale, we are following a pretty disciplined set of chess moves to add capabilities to it. A large number of those capabilities are organic, and then we\u2019ll be selective about inorganic.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then I was curious about the competitive landscape. Your competitor launched a new mid-range platform that they believe will be a fairly big game changer, at least, for their installed base. I\u2019m curious and they obviously want to gain share, sort of how are you thinking about what\u2019s out there right now? And what kind of a competitive environment do you expect in the coming quarters? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: It\u2019s always competitive. To this particular platform, it is a long delayed and still very much incomplete. And so we see it as complete opportunity for us. Now that they\u2019ve announced it, we\u2019re going after them. Stay tuned.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Shannon. Next question?\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.\nAnanda Baruah: Hi, George. Hi, Mike. Thanks for taking the question. Yes, just one for me. And George, I apologize if this was already asked. I was kind of moving between a couple of different calls this afternoon. How does sort of what\u2019s taken place, impact, how you guys are approaching your sales force initiatives and your enterprise customer expansion initiative? Would just love any context around that and how you guys are thinking about that? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: We clearly see COVID-19 accelerating a set of transitions in the market. I think the most important one of those is the digital transformation of our customers. And that digital transformation is highly data-driven, right? You cannot be successful in digital transformation without modern data infrastructure, and that creates opportunity for us. There are a series of market transitions that follow from that, right? There\u2019s operating system transition. There is major database migrations going on. And, of course, there are competitive product transitions that are technology transitions like the 10-K replacement cycle. We\u2019re going to attack in those transitions. So we\u2019d be pretty laser-focused on getting our teams to focus on our strongest product offerings, and we\u2019re working to attack those market transitions and be as productive as we can. And we\u2019ve seen good results from that in Q3 and Q4 net new customer ads and we\u2019re going to continue to stay focused. And we\u2019ll provide you an update at the next earnings call and our Analyst Day.\nAnanda Baruah: And that\u2019s helpful, George. And how about net new sales people add?\nGeorge Kurian: We are on track, as I mentioned in my comments, we completed the 200 net new demand generation headcount without increase to operating expenses by Q4. So within Q4, one quarter ahead of schedule, we\u2019ve met the commitments we\u2019ve made to ourselves and to you. And we\u2019re focused on getting them productive. The early cohorts are starting to show results. And so we feel good about where we are. So thank you for your questions.\nAnanda Baruah: Thanks very much.\nKris Newton: All right. Thank you, Ananda. I\u2019ll turn it over to George for some closing remarks.\nGeorge Kurian: In the face of the current healthcare crisis, we will continue to make strategic moves that position us to emerge stronger than before, while maintaining the operational discipline you have come to expect from NetApp. Our storage system powered by our industry-leading file block and object software and our cloud data services have clear compelling competitive advantages and significant market presence. To further exploit our leading position, we are expanding our reach with a dedicated cloud sales focus, greater enterprise sales coverage, and dedicated customer acquisition resources. In Q4, we continue to see progress in our cloud business and success with our dedicated acquired districts. Getting our industry-leading portfolio in front of more buyers will enable us to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever. I hope that you all stay safe and healthy. And in closing, I believe that by working together with creativity and resilience, we will find together a path forward out of this crisis. I want to thank you, our investors, our partners, customers, and the NetApp\u2019s team for the amazing work that we have done together this past few months. We hope to see you at our Analyst Day in September. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George, and thanks for that wonderful introduction. First, I also want to express my sympathy to all those who have been impacted by the current health crisis and extend my sincere gratitude to the selfless frontline workers who put themselves in harm's way to help keep us all safe. The COVID-19 pandemic has made for a very interesting first 60 days for me at NetApp, but the unusual circumstances have only reinforced my initial views of the strong NetApp culture. I have been very impressed with the quality of the team and the level of collaboration and commitment across the entire organization. From day one, it has been clear that this team is all pulling in the same direction with a high level of transparency and accountability and a tireless determination to continue serving our customers across the globe. When you couple this with NetApp's business model, loyal customer base, go-to-market engine and product development, we are positioned to do great things in the future. Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation to George and the entire Board for giving me this opportunity and to Ron for his help during my unusual onboarding. I'm extremely excited about joining NetApp and look forward to working alongside George and the rest of the talented team, as we continue to drive innovation in data management. In the current environment, it is important to highlight NetApp's solid liquidity position and business model. NetApp's healthy balance sheet and considerable free cash flow generation provide us the ability to make strategic decisions that are best aligned with long-term shareholder value. This is particularly critical in times of uncertainty. We closed Q4 with $2.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. As of year-end, we also had approximately $500 million available through our credit facility. And we are confident, we have access to the corporate debt market, if needed. Our strong liquidity position has allowed us to provide extended credit programs to our channel partners during the health crisis. Given this is my first call as NetApp's CFO, I wanted to walk through how I view capital allocation. Our strong liquidity position and the fact that we generated roughly $1 billion of free cash flow last year, allow us to remain committed to our dividend, which now carries more than a 4% yield. In fiscal 2020, we paid out nearly 50% of our free cash flow to dividends. In the current environment, we believe it is prudent to pause our share repurchase program, which we did in late March, until we have a better sense for the timing and magnitude of the broader economic recovery. Longer-term, share repurchases will play a key role in our capital allocation strategy, with the goal to have buybacks at least offset dilution from our equity plans. Consistent with NetApp's long history of disciplined M&A, our acquisition strategy will remain focused on bolstering our strategic roadmap, particularly within our Cloud Data Services business. Of course, all of these uses of capital will be balanced against reinvesting in the business for future growth. Before going through our Q4 and fiscal 2020 results, I would like to remind you that I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Despite the demand weakness, logistical challenges and minor supply constraints as a result of COVID-19, we delivered strong gross margins, healthy operating leverage and substantial free cash flow in the fourth quarter. In Q4, net revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 12% year-over-year, including nearly 1 point of currency headwind. It is worth highlighting that our two key strategic focus areas, our Storage business, powered by our industry-leading File, Block and Object Software and Cloud Data Services, both performed considerably better than the rest of the business. Our all-flash revenue of $656 million was down 3% year-over-year. We continue to believe that there is a very healthy runway for all-flash adoption, as only 24% of our installed systems are all-flash. Cloud data services delivered $111 million in ARR, growing 113% year-over-year and an impressive 34% sequentially. Cloud data services customer count now exceeds 3,500, more than doubling from Q4 of last year. Total product revenue of $793 million decreased approximately 21% year-over-year. ELA revenue in Q4 was less than $10 million. Given that ELAs represents such a small portion of our business, we will not be breaking out ELA revenue in future quarters. As you know, over the last year, the timing and magnitude of ELAs has proven extremely difficult to predict. In an effort to have a more predictable forecast, be more conservative and reduce confusion, we will not be including ELAs and guidance going forward. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $546 million, was up nearly 4% year-over-year. These two recurring revenue lines comprise roughly 40% of total net revenue. Going forward, we will focus a lot more on our high-margin recurring revenue streams, where renewals play a big role in growth. I have been incredibly impressed with the work the team has done around renewals, implementing a much more rigorous sales motion and simplified quoting system. We ended Q4 with $3.7 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Gross margin of 68%, was up nearly 3 points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 56.4%, an increase of over 1 point year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by an increase in all-flash product mix. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services continues to be an incredibly profitable business for us, with gross margin of 83.2%, which was up 1 point year-over-year. The margin expansion was mainly driven by continued leverage in our support model. Q4 operating expenses of $629 million, decreased approximately 8% year-over-year, driven by lower variable compensation associated with the shortfall in revenue. Operating margin was 23.1%, up more than a 0.5 point from Q4 of last year. EPS of $1.19, was down 2% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $383 million and free cash flow was $359 million, representing 26% of revenue. During Q4, we repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $49.50, for a total of $161 million. As of the end of Q4, we had $478 million remaining on our original $4 billion buyback authorization. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $222 million, down 27 million shares year-on-year, representing an 11% decrease. During the quarter, we paid out $105 million in cash dividends. We will maintain our cash dividend of $0.48 per share in Q1. Turning to our full-year 2020 results. Net revenues of $5.4 billion decreased 12% year-over-year, including a 0.5 point of currency headwind. Gross margin of 67.9%, was up nearly three points compared to fiscal 2019. Operating margin of 20.8% decreased nearly 2 points versus fiscal 2019, due to lower-than-anticipated revenues. EPS of $4.05, decreased 10% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $936 million in fiscal 2020, which represented 17% of net revenues. We completed $1.4 billion in share repurchases and $439 million in dividends in the fiscal year. And over the last three years, we have returned $5.4 billion to shareholders. Now onto guidance. As you all know, demand visibility has been significantly impacted by COVID-19. As a result, we are not guiding the full-year at this time. We will reassess our ability to provide fiscal 2021 guidance after Q1. With that as a backdrop, we did think it was important to provide boundaries to the demand scenarios we are seeing in the near-term. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.09 billion and $1.24 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a 6% decline in revenues year-over-year, including 1.5 points of currency headwind. We expect consolidated gross margin to range between 67% and 68% and operating margin to be approximately 10%. Assumed in this guidance, our Q1 operating expenses of $660 million to $670 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19% and expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $0.36 and $0.44 per share. As a reminder, Q1 has an extra week this year, which adds approximately $30 million to $35 million to both our recurring revenues and total operating expenses for the quarter. The incremental revenue and expenses largely offset each other at the operating income level and thus have minimal impact to EPS. A quick comment on our go-forward expense structure. As George highlighted, we invested in our go-to-market engine by adding 200 primary sales resources over the last three quarters. And we did this without adding incremental dollars to our operating expense envelope. At this time, we have decided not to make any significant structural changes to our expense base until we have better visibility into the duration and magnitude of the current downturn. We continue to closely monitor the situation, which will likely remain very fluid over the next two to three quarters. As we look forward to fiscal 2021, I did want to highlight two key strategic goals for the year. Our cloud connected all-flash portfolio continues to offer customers a unique architecture that bridges on-prem and public cloud environments under a singular ONTAP software platform. While the shape of the economic recovery will largely determine the overall growth rate for the storage industry, our goal for fiscal 2021 is to reestablish share gains in the storage market. In the coming year, we will also continue to grow and invest in our Cloud Data Services business. Fiscal 2020 was a foundational year in launching both Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Volumes Service across AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. We also acquired two great assets in Talon and Cloud Jumper, expanding the breadth of our cloud data services platform and adding nicely to our overall cloud TAM. We remain confident in cloud data services unique market position. Partner and customer feedback has only reaffirmed our confidence in the size of the opportunity. But to be prudent, we thought best to reset expectations around the ARR ramp, so we are removing the fiscal 2021 target for Cloud Data Services ARR of $400 million to $600 million. We will provide new guidance and trackable metrics for our Cloud Data Services business at our Analyst Day in September. Fiscal 2021 will serve as a critical growth year for the Cloud Data Services franchise, which will be aided by a new dedicated cloud data services sales force. In closing, I want to thank our partners, customers and investors for their continued support. And a special thank you to the NetApp employees for stepping up during this global crisis. It is clearly a unique time to be joining NetApp. I see real opportunity to add value as our business continues to evolve with a clear goal of driving significant long-term value for our shareholders. As George noted, we are planning to host an Analyst Day in September, which will provide a great overview of our strategic initiatives and include an update to our long-term financial model. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? No, that's it. Thank you. Yes, Simon, it's Mike Berry. So, if you look year-over-year, that's exactly what you do see. I would always encourage you because of seasonality to look year-over-year as it relates to gross margin. So, when you look at total, the slight increase, we get \u2013 you get a little benefit in Q1 year-over-year from the 14th-week, so you have to take that into account. But then the higher mix of services at 80%-plus drives the total gross margin up as it relates to year-over-year, and again seasonality will have a significant influence if you look sequentially, and that's just not as applicable as the year-over-year numbers. Yes. I think there's two parts what George walked through as well as just giving extended terms to some of our channel partners as they deal with our end users, and our financial flexibility also helps us their assignment. Yes. Tim, so as George mentioned, we feel really good about the business. Nice growth in Q4, sequential growth. So it doesn't reflect us not \u2013 our confidence level. As he mentioned, we're a little bit behind where we were in the original guide was done. And I would like to be able to address that, as well as kind of the long-term model all at once in September. Hence, we didn't want to update it now and not do the rest of the business. So that's why we said, \u201cHey, we will address all of that as it relates to the business when we get together, hopefully in person or virtually in September. No, nothing more. And on that, Lou, it's Mike. I would just add, to George's point, it's all about making sure our employees are safe and dealing with it now. As you look forward, companies have a lot of areas to look into, be it real estate, be it travel, marketing events. What does that mean for the sales team? But I think it's way too early for us to be able to tell that. We need to figure out how this goes over the next, call it, several months or quarters, and then a lot of companies will be asking those very questions. Thank you. Yes. So this \u2013 Nehal, this is Mike. So a couple of things on that. Keep in mind that, that in revenue, mix matters a lot. We do get 30 to 35 from the extra week that's in the revenue numbers. So if you look year-over-year, take that into account. And then in Q1, because the product revenue from a seasonal perspective is lower. This is where the strength of our recurring revenue comes in as well. So that, that helps us also on that range. So that's really how we got to that, call it, high-end of the guidance range, really driven by the mix, the strength of recurring revenue and then the benefit from the 14th-week. So I have George talked about, it's really a continuation of what we saw in the latter part, call it, of our Q4. So it assumes that what we saw in April and later March continues into Q1."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we get into the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented situation we are all experiencing. First and foremost, I want to express my sympathy for those who have been impacted by COVID-19 and my gratitude to those frontline workers, whose efforts help to keep us healthy and safe. I also want to acknowledge the tremendous amount of work that the NetApp team has done to coordinate efforts around the globe to keep our teams safe, while going above and beyond to be a strong partner to our customers. NetApp is an essential business providing critical infrastructure to vital public health and safety services, first responders, and public sector institutions in battleground cities. We've increased our level of support for them, so that they can stay focused on their critical missions. In partnership with Core Scientific, we are giving COVID-19 researchers free access to AI as a service, powered by ONTAP AI and NVIDIA. We are also helping customers rapidly build virtual desktop infrastructure environments to support their growing remote workforce, and to help continue the education of our younger generation, our cloud solutions have been rapidly adopted in the last few weeks alone by many new state, local, and education customers to support VDI for telework and remote classrooms. I'm so proud of the commitment and courage the NetApp team has demonstrated to each other to our partners and customers and to our community. My sincere thanks for all these fantastic efforts. They are representative of NetApp at our very best. Now, let's turn to the results of the quarter. We continue to make progress in improving our operational execution. By focusing on what we can control, we delivered strong gross margin, cash flow, and operating leverage in Q4 despite the challenging environment. The quarter started off well, and we were tracking to our targets until countries around the globe began going into lockdown. In April, the pace of business slowed significantly and our visibility was reduced. We saw delays in some large deals, while at the same time some companies accelerated orders to get ahead of shutdowns and others initiated new transactions to address the demands of remote working and digital business. Over the course of FY 2020, I've outlined our plans to get in front of more buyers and more accounts with our industry-leading portfolio, where we know we can win. Our continued success in our dedicated acquired districts reinforced our decision to maintain the investments to expand our reach, despite the current market uncertainty. In Q4, we achieved our target of adding 200 primary sales headcount one quarter ahead of schedule. This additional sales capacity has enabled us to close coverage gaps and to dedicate resources focused on new customer acquisitions. As a reminder, we funded this headcount by making trade-offs in the business not by adding to the company's total operating expenses. Additionally, we continued to sharpen our focus on markets, where we have both a significant presence and clear competitive advantage, our storage, and Cloud Data Services businesses. Our File, Block, and Object Storage systems have strong industry and market endorsement from customers, partners, and analysts. We've made our solutions easier to consume with Keystone, our reinvention of the customer experience. Keystone gives companies a real path to hybrid multi-cloud IT by delivering a consistent experience and subscription business model in both the biggest public clouds and in company's data center. We made tremendous progress in our cloud business in FY 2020. As I noted last quarter, we achieved general availability on all the leading cloud providers. NetApp Cloud Volumes is the number one shared file storage platform available in all the public clouds. Our intellectual property is embedded in every region and data center that Microsoft, Google, and Amazon Web Services bring online. We were again named Google Cloud Technology Partner of the Year for Infrastructure. Azure NetApp Files is Microsoft's shared storage platform for primary workloads, SAP, high-performance computing, database, Windows Virtual Desktop, and the Azure VMware Service. Azure continues to be a good source for new customer acquisition with more than 40% of Azure NetApp Files customers being new to NetApp. Our cloud partners are asking us to expand regional deployments, broaden workload certifications, and invest in go-to-market activities to support this rapidly growing business. Based on the last month of Q4, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to $111 million. We saw growth accelerate through the quarter, as we continue to scale our cloud volume service and more companies turn to cloud to rapidly meet the requirements of remote working and digital business. We are adding new cloud customers and additional data services, such as cloud backup and cloud compliance, which are helping to drive new workloads and increased usage amongst existing customers, and we continue to bring more value to the cloud volumes platform. In the past two months, we acquired Talon, a provider of file caching software for remote and branch office workloads; and CloudJumper, a provider of a virtual desktop in the public cloud. We've added these services to our cloud offerings to deliver a comprehensive, modern workplace foundation for all companies from born in the cloud startups in small businesses to the largest global enterprises. We're excited to include these talented teams in the NetApp family. As we enter into FY 2021, we will continue to manage the business efficiently while focusing on two clear priorities: returning to growth with share gains in our storage business powered by our industry-leading file block and object software and scaling our highly differentiated Cloud Data Services business. We will exploit competitive transitions and the accelerating shift to cloud to expand the usage of our products and services. We will continue to simplify the customer experience by bringing cloud-like flexibility to on-premises environments and deepening the connections between on-premises and cloud, and we will continue to strengthen our partnerships with the cloud providers and add value to our cloud data services, all of which will make it easier for customers to manage data in the hybrid multi-cloud environment and drive preference for our technology. We will also continue to evolve and align our sales and marketing to capture the opportunity ahead. We recently announced that Cesar Cernuda will join NetApp in July as President, leading sales, marketing, services, and support. Cesar has an impressive track record in leading transformations, building diverse high-performing teams, and driving a successful cloud business. He will continue to evolve our go-to-market strategy and operations to transform how we capitalize on the changing customer landscape to drive growth, particularly in cloud. Entering FY 2021, we created a separate globally integrated structure for our cloud data services sales teams, with the sole focus of scaling our Cloud Services business by maximizing our partnerships with the world's biggest public clouds and helping our customers and partners accelerate their public cloud journey. And as I noted earlier, we have closed coverage gaps with expanded enterprise sales and dedicated customer acquisition teams to further strengthen our position in the storage market. Data has always been central to the work we do. And the role of data is more important now than ever before. The resilience of our society and of our financial, governmental, educational and healthcare systems depends on the reliable safe and flexible access, storage and management of data. That is our vision. CEOs are prioritizing the ability to deliver services and products remotely to reach customers through digital means and to optimize remote operations and collaboration. It is critical to have an integrated IT architecture, especially for data. With our Data Fabric strategy, we help customers tackle these challenges by modernizing legacy infrastructure and simplifying the integration and orchestration of data services, so that they can rapidly respond to a changing environment and fuel innovation. While we cannot predict when the world will return to normal, the enduring importance of data is clear. We are confident that the demand for our products and services will be strong as we emerge from this crisis. The strength and resiliency of our business model enables us to continue to execute our strategy while navigating a range of demand environments. We will continue to make prudent decisions in the face of the current reality, focusing on the priorities that will enable us to return to growth. We will also maintain operational discipline and ensure that our strong balance sheet will support our ability to create long-term shareholder value through a wide range of scenarios. We are focusing our resources on the solutions that lead to the highest returns, storage and cloud data services. We are broadening our reach with a dedicated cloud sales focus, expanded enterprise sales coverage and dedicated customer acquisition resources. I'm confident that these actions position NetApp to emerge from the current health crisis stronger than ever. We will host an Analyst Day on September the 16th, where we will share more information on our plans for the continued evolution of NetApp and a multi-year business outlook. We hope that you'll be able to join us. Finally, I'm happy to introduce Mike Berry, our new Chief Financial Officer. I'm excited to have Mike and his deep knowledge of the technology and software industry on the team. He will be a key partner, as we strengthen our leadership position in hybrid cloud data services and deliver long-term shareholder value. Mike's first day coincided with our local shelter in place order. Despite the unique start, he has quickly integrated into the company and he is already making an impact. Mike, welcome. I think if you look across the geographies, the order trends somewhat followed the impact of COVID across the world. I think our Asia Pacific business was first impacted by COVID, particularly in the areas surrounding China. I think we've seen that part of the business come back online. Through the course of the quarter, as we said in our prepared remarks, we felt that we were on target until the impact of COVID started to broaden across the globe, and we saw several different things going on. Some customers pulled forward transactions so that they could deploy and be ready before the shelter-in-place took full impact. Others clearly, either deferred transactions or downsized transactions, our supply chain performance was strong. Thanks to some really good work done by our supply chain team. And so, we were able to meet most of the orders that customers wanted within the course of their requirements. From a vertical market perspective, as I said, we cover a broad range of industries, and so there is no single geography or industry that has a material part of our business. I think that when we look at the results from the quarter, financial services and healthcare were strong performers. Automotive, retail meaning traditional retail and oil and gas were weaker through the course of the quarter. And similarly, oil dependent economies were challenged through the course of the quarter. I think, as I said, they were \u2013 we had less visibility into order trajectory in the last four weeks than in the first couple of months, the periods of the couple of months of the quarter. I think, as we look into the \u2013 where we are today, there's isn't material change from that, which is why we are being cautious about providing guidance a quarter at a time. I'm trying to be cautious in the commentary around our guidance itself. Mike, do you want to add anything? We have a broad range of capabilities to meet customers' needs for OpEx kinds of business models and cash preservation concerns. They range, of course, from cloud data services, which are available on all the leading public cloud platforms, and we saw several customers take advantage not only of the flexibility that the cloud data services portfolio had, but also the rapid time to provision. We have introduced a program called Keystone, which is a subscription offering for enterprise data centers, and we saw some strong wins in that part of our business, as well as a healthy pipeline. And then clearly, we work with partners through managed service offerings, which are typically on a monthly basis payment model. And we have third parties we work with around traditional leasing models for customers. I'm happy to have Mike comment further. First of all, we feel even more bullish today about the demand for our offerings than we did a year ago. I think that over the last year, as Mike mentioned, we have added a substantial number of customers more than doubled our customer base and there are a lot of net new customers coming to NetApp. We have, as we mentioned, been a year behind where we needed to be in terms of getting the services to general availability. And we still have \u2013 we are still working to get through a completely frictionless sales model together with Microsoft, for example. So there's really good work being done. We are expanding the number of use cases. We've got more data centers being deployed, but we are about a year behind where we felt we would be and that's been our consistent commentary even in the last quarter. I'll let Mike comment with regard to the guide.S There's clearly a set of those customers who have never bought anything from NetApp. Some of those customers are truly digital natives, meaning, they don't have the concept of an enterprise data center. And there, the cross-sell and up-sell is for the vast majority of those customers. We have a very narrow slice today of their total cloud wallet, meaning, in terms of workloads and we can expand there. Many of the customers also have enterprise data centers. And so our discussions with them are obviously, \u201cHey, if you're going to use us on the public cloud, why couldn't you be able to deploy us in your data center?\u201d I'll give you an example. There's a several large global companies who have us as a second vendor, not the primary vendor in their enterprise data center, but we are their primary shared platform in the public cloud. They are now giving us a broader range of opportunities in the enterprise data center. So as the COVID crisis abates and we see enterprise data centers being more \u2013 being expanded, we'll see more share of footprints, at least, that's our confident belief. Thanks, Katy. I think when we look at the overall profile of our business, we have, as you mentioned, a really strong margin profile in terms of gross margins, reflecting the rich software contribution to our business. I think, as Mike mentioned in terms of capital allocation, we are going to continue to support the dividend at the current level going forward. The place where we will have to reevaluate that is if we see some structural impairment to our free cash flow, which we don't see at the moment. So we're going to continue to stay with the dividend. We have hit a pause on the buybacks. We've done a lot of buybacks over the last couple of years, almost $3.5 billion, and so we're going to pause that until we have better visibility into the overall landscape. And we are going to be selective, but we continue to see opportunities to expand our strategic relevance and the portfolio, like you mentioned. So we're going to continue to balance all of these cases. I would tell you that as we think about the go-forward strategic roadmap, it's much more tied to software and cloud services. We're not leaning towards doing horizontal consolidations for scale. I think that, that would not be a primary focus for us. I think we have a good handle on the customer discussions that we are engaged in. As I mentioned, one of the areas that we invested in without raising the overall operating expense level of the company was to put primary demand generation, account executives facing customers. So we have a good close dialogue with these customers. For those that want to be able to take advantage of technology without having to deploy large amounts of cash, we are uniquely positioned in the market because of our cloud data services portfolio. They are instantly provisionable. They have the reach and scale of the world's biggest hyperscale data centers, and in many ways, also allow customers to start their journey on the cloud. That would be our lead offer, right? I think with regard to subscription services and other use cases, we are selective. I don't think we're trying to say that at this point in time that we are going to transition our entire business over to a subscription model. I think we need to have that in our portfolio and we'll have it, but we are selective about qualifying, which customers we provide subscription offerings to. I would tell you that, as we said, we were going to bring on 200 primary demand generation headcount, starting from the beginning of Q2 of FY 2020 through the end of Q1 of FY 2021, which is the current quarter. We have accomplished that objective a little bit ahead of plan. We are in the process of enabling those sales headcount. I would tell you they typically, as we have said before, take three to four quarters to get up to full productivity and we feel good about the work they're doing so far. I think that we've also said that we would focus them on new customer acquisition, some on cloud and clearly on the strongest places in our portfolio, which is our all-flash arrays and our object storage and they have seen good results in the second-half of this year. So as we have started to deploy and focus these resources, we are starting to see some good underlying trends in the business. Not all of our healthcare business is categorized as public sector. Certainly, there are pieces of it like University Hospitals, State University Hospitals that are in public sector, but not the whole business, right? I think, if I look at healthcare overall, there were \u2013 we had a lot of customer wins because of the strength of our solutions for digital imaging, the advancements that we are doing with NVIDIA around AI for imaging, and there are lots of unique technologies in our ONTAP operating system that enables that type of a workflow to be really successful. The second is, with regard to the healthcare customer base, we've also stepped up our support for them. I think they are highly stressed that the amount of work, so I don't think there was any sort of budgetary issue we saw. It was really just the capacity of work they are doing to sustain their patient levels and the sort of the level of work that they're sort of patient-facing workforce has. I think that's really about healthcare. With regard to the public sector, again, we have a broad book of business, covering both federal, state and local, government and education. Within education, we saw several customer wins around the rapid movement of that part of our world to a remote working, remote education model. And so both our private cloud solutions and certainly our public cloud, modern workplace solutions benefited from that move. I would tell you that visibility is \u2013 it's choppy, right? It's across the board. It's a little choppy. I think in our public sector business, we had a couple of deals that did not close within the quarter, just because of the logistics of being able to try to bring teams together to close the transaction. That's correct. I think that if you think about the coronavirus as a \u2013 as an opportunity to disrupt, you can lean into these conversations with customers, right? One of the things that we see with the use of remote working tools is that our sales teams can bring the best of NetApp to any customer anywhere in the globe. Meaning, they can bring the CEO now on any given day to a discussion in Asia, Europe and North America, all in the course of a single day. That wasn't possible in the old world, right? So, we are trying to lean into the changes. As I said, we feel good about the progress of our acquired districts, which was a key place that we were targeting some of our headcount. Even in Q4, they had good performance. We have been focused on the cloud business as a place to continue to ramp our success that had good results. And I think that you should expect from us and as we have demonstrated over the past several years, we are disciplined operators, right? So if we don't see a return on that investment, we'll certainly look to do something else with it. And so you should expect Mike and I to stay focused on the evolving nature of the market and we'll adjust accordingly. Thanks, Jim. No, I think that the strong gross margin profile of our business is reflective of both the discipline of our sales force, as well as the differentiation of our products. I think we have an extraordinarily good technology portfolio. As I said, in the Storage business, we have the leadership position, not second, not third, the leadership position in five block object technologies, which is the full range and we have uniquely differentiated cloud data services. So, yes, the market is always competitive. But I think that, as we have demonstrated over several quarters now, product gross margins continue to be an area of focus for us. We have incented the sales force to stay disciplined around discounting, and you saw that through the quarter, and we're going to take it a quarter at a time and keep staying disciplined around that. Mike, you want to end? I think, first of all, I want to thank the NetApp team. I'm \u2013 I could never have been more proud than what I saw from our team this past quarter. Across the board, we started our planning to deal with the COVID crisis in January when we first saw the impact in China. And as a result of working from home has been pretty seamless on everything from engineering deliverables to the incredible work that our support team and our supply chain teams have done, we have for the most part being able to operate without disruption. I think the place that we are continuing to focus in on is the ability to engage customers through a digital medium. And I think that we are new to it just like everybody else, right, but we see opportunity there. I think with regard to the long-term model, it's a little bit early to tell. I think we are certainly cautious about returning our workforce to the office. I think we're going to do it step wise with the priority being the safety of our employees. And so we see that it will be a hybrid model with a large percentage of our employees working in at home or other flexible locations of their choice. And we'll factor that over time as it settles into what the new normal looks like. We're certainly going to factor that in over time into what we can do to best serve our employees and customers. It's difficult for me to give you specific guidance, given the volatility of COVID. I will tell you that our all-flash SaaS business, which is the predominant part of our all-flash array business has started to perform much better as we have driven focus and as we have driven enterprise sales coverage. That doesn't show the overall all-flash array number yet. But the trends underneath the all-flash array numbers are much healthier than what the overall number shows. So we're encouraged by that. And I think we're going to stay focused, as we've said, on exploiting our position there and getting it back to growth. From an installed base perspective, it is still a small percentage, right? So all-flash installed base is at 24%. So we got a long way to go. And so we're going to stay focused on using all the levels that are disposal to gain share. Yes. As part of our cloud data services portfolio, what we said consistently is, we're going to get the fundamental infrastructure into the \u2013 into all the major hyperscalers, which is our cloud volumes platform. We were then going to add data services on top of that, and we've added several organically built backup and data protection services. We've done cloud governance and compliance services. And now what we are doing is, we are building out a modern workplace solution that combines a global file consolidation solution that we acquired in Q4 called Talon and a virtual desktop infrastructure and desktop as a service solution provider called Cloud Jumper that we acquired in Q1 of fiscal year 2021. The combination of cloud volumes, Talon and Cloud Jumper, gives us an extremely strong offering in the market. And it's particularly suited to the broad transition of virtual desktop services to what we see as Windows virtual desktop, which is a new offering created by Microsoft to enable customers to have much more efficient virtual desktop infrastructures on the Azure cloud. And so you'll see us tell you more about that in the coming quarters, but we're really excited and we saw some significant customer wins. Cloud Jumper had been a longstanding partner of NetApp, and we had worked together with them to do many cloud deals before and now that they are integrated into NetApp. We think that, that should accelerate our business further. I don't think, first of all, some of the CDS customers are acquired through Microsoft. And so incentive that are provided to those customers are really provided by Microsoft to deploy those workloads on the Azure Cloud, right? I think with regard to cross-selling them to an on-prem environment, it really is more of a relationship and a customer confidence discussion rather than a specific kind of incentives \u2013 commercial incentives. I'll give you an example. We are certified to run SAP on both the Google Cloud as well as the Azure Cloud. And many customers use \u2013 are starting to use SAP on those cloud provider platform with NetApp. They may not run their entire SAP environment on those clouds. They may run a portion of it, for example, analytics or business intelligence or something like that. And so we get to go and tell them listen, you're using SAP on Azure, on NetApp and you like the technology and the benefits. Why wouldn't you use us for your transaction processing environment on-premise? So it's more of a relationship and a customer confidence and awareness of benefit we get in specific incentives. Today, we have, given the importance of the workloads that we serve, these are production environments that we support in customers. We have a, what we call whitelisting requirements with Microsoft. So there's essentially, the customer has to register with a Microsoft website that then creates a manual provisioning step where NetApp has to call the customer and make sure that that's \u2013 customers ready to go live. I think as we have scaled the business, we are working closely with Microsoft to remove that requirement, so that we can automatically provision workloads on to NetApp Cloud Volumes. And we're looking forward to that when that happens. There's still work to be done, but both teams are working actively to remove that requirement. We've always been pretty disciplined about the uses of cash. We're going to continue to do that. I think where we do acquisitions, we are very selective. We spend a lot of time to make sure that both strategic and cultural fit, as well as financial benefits to our shareholders over time. So we're going to continue to stay disciplined on acquisitions. I think with regard to the cloud portfolio itself, the vast majority of our cloud revenue today is through organic development. We feel that we have taken \u2013 unlike anyone else in the industry, taken the world's best storage and data management operating system, made it cloud enabled and integrated it into every major data center of the world's three biggest public cloud. And not only that, two of the big three are actually selling it as their own service. And that has been the big amount of work we've done. Now that, that foundation is in place and starting to scale, we are following a pretty disciplined set of chess moves to add capabilities to it. A large number of those capabilities are organic, and then we'll be selective about inorganic. It's always competitive. To this particular platform, it is a long delayed and still very much incomplete. And so we see it as complete opportunity for us. Now that they've announced it, we're going after them. Stay tuned. We clearly see COVID-19 accelerating a set of transitions in the market. I think the most important one of those is the digital transformation of our customers. And that digital transformation is highly data-driven, right? You cannot be successful in digital transformation without modern data infrastructure, and that creates opportunity for us. There are a series of market transitions that follow from that, right? There's operating system transition. There is major database migrations going on. And, of course, there are competitive product transitions that are technology transitions like the 10-K replacement cycle. We're going to attack in those transitions. So we'd be pretty laser-focused on getting our teams to focus on our strongest product offerings, and we're working to attack those market transitions and be as productive as we can. And we've seen good results from that in Q3 and Q4 net new customer ads and we're going to continue to stay focused. And we'll provide you an update at the next earnings call and our Analyst Day. We are on track, as I mentioned in my comments, we completed the 200 net new demand generation headcount without increase to operating expenses by Q4. So within Q4, one quarter ahead of schedule, we've met the commitments we've made to ourselves and to you. And we're focused on getting them productive. The early cohorts are starting to show results. And so we feel good about where we are. So thank you for your questions. In the face of the current healthcare crisis, we will continue to make strategic moves that position us to emerge stronger than before, while maintaining the operational discipline you have come to expect from NetApp. Our storage system powered by our industry-leading file block and object software and our cloud data services have clear compelling competitive advantages and significant market presence. To further exploit our leading position, we are expanding our reach with a dedicated cloud sales focus, greater enterprise sales coverage, and dedicated customer acquisition resources. In Q4, we continue to see progress in our cloud business and success with our dedicated acquired districts. Getting our industry-leading portfolio in front of more buyers will enable us to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever. I hope that you all stay safe and healthy. And in closing, I believe that by working together with creativity and resilience, we will find together a path forward out of this crisis. I want to thank you, our investors, our partners, customers, and the NetApp's team for the amazing work that we have done together this past few months. We hope to see you at our Analyst Day in September. Thank you."

My name is Cherie, and I will be your conference call coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please proceed Ms. Newton.\nKris Newton: Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2020, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns and our ability to improve execution gain share, reaccelerate growth and expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, the IT capital spending environment, and our ability to expand our total available market acquire new accounts expand in existing accounts, capitalize on our Data Fabric strategy, improve our consistency of sales execution and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019, including the management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations and risk factors sections and our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into our results for the third quarter I want to take a moment to talk about Ron. Today we announced that, Ron has decided to retire by the end of the fiscal year. I want to recognize his many contributions since joining NetApp in 2016. Under Ron's leadership, we have increased product margins by 10 points, nearly doubled our earnings power and raised our dividend by over 100%. He has played a pivotal role in helping NetApp navigate a transformational period as we focus on becoming the leader in hybrid cloud data services. I think you'll agree that he's always been a true and honest broker. Knowing that this is his last earnings call before he retires is certainly bittersweet for me. We continuously think about what's next for the company and that includes thoughtful proactive succession planning. To that end Ron and I have been talking about the prospect of this transition for some time. During the search process, we have been focused on finding the right person to take on the role of Chief Financial Officer, and I'm very pleased with the quality of candidates. I expect that we will have someone in the role before the end of the quarter. Ron will stay on to ensure a seamless transition and I'm grateful for that.\nRon Pasek: Thank you, George. Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation for the opportunity to work alongside the talented team here at NetApp. These past four years have been incredibly rewarding. The team has proved to be collaborative, innovative and empowering and I'm proud of what we have achieved during my time here. I also want to thank the investor and analyst community as it's been a genuine pleasure working with all of you. This is an exciting time for our industry and for NetApp, and I look forward to helping our next CFO transition into the role.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you, Ron. Now, let's turn to an overview of the quarter. Despite the top line challenges, we continued our operational discipline, highlighted by strong gross margin, cash flow and operating leverage without the benefit from anticipated ELA revenue in the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our business model as we take deliberate steps to better capitalize on our opportunity and return the company to growth. However, macroeconomic headwinds and unpredictability in large enterprise purchasing behavior persist. Customers are on a journey to the cloud and they are looking to NetApp to help them as they grapple with the complexities of data management in hybrid multi-cloud IT environments. With our Data Fabric strategy, we help customers address these challenges giving us access to new buyers and workloads, as well as increasing the relevance of NetApp to companies both large and small. We not only have opportunity in the public cloud, but we also have increased our value for on-premises deployments. Our ability to deliver real business value to customers' hybrid multi-cloud environments, fuels my confidence that we can return to growth. While we see exceptional opportunity ahead, we are planning our business assuming no change in external factors for the foreseeable future. To improve our execution in this environment, we laid out a plan at the start of the fiscal year to replicate our proven areas of success by getting in front of more buyers with our full portfolio. We are on track to increase sales capacity by approximately 200 primary sales resources by the end of Q1 fiscal year 2021 without adding to the total operating expenses for the company. The majority of the sales headcount will be deployed in our Americas geography. They will be focused on acquiring new accounts and engaging new buyers like cloud architects in existing accounts. We are seeing early signs of success by expanding our reach and focus on new customer acquisition. Our dedicated acquired districts continue to deliver strong growth across all metrics sales, units and customers. The growth of these metrics accelerated in Q3, as did the growth of the pipeline pointing to continued progress in coming quarters. While the acquired districts performed well, we still need to broaden our share of wallet at our largest customers. We are making progress here. However, it is in our largest accounts which have the greatest exposure to the macro that the demand environment is the least predictable. In Q3, our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services increased from Q2 to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.3 billion. We introduced new all-flash array and hybrid flash array platforms as well as a SAN-optimized all-flash array, which delivers a simplified and dedicated SAN experience. Our core storage offerings continue to gain industry accolades. Last quarter NetApp took the highest ranking in the leaders' quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for primary storage. In Q3, NetApp was named a leader in IDC's file-based storage MarketScape with the recommendation that customers in need of hybrid cloud solutions should consider NetApp, because of our expanded product portfolio investments and vision. Our building blocks for private cloud deployments SolidFire, NetApp HCI and StorageGRID enable customers to bring public cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. Our private cloud business, inclusive of products and services grew 10% from last quarter, attaining an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $350 million. To meet the increasing demand for Object Storage, NetApp announced new StorageGRID software platforms and the ability to tier to Azure Blob Storage. IDC named NetApp a leader in its object-based storage MarketScape citing our vast experience in unstructured data. They recommend customers consider StorageGRID, when dealing with petabyte-scale data sets across various deployment locations because of its unique hybrid multi-cloud integrations. Based on the last month of Q3, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to approximately $83 million, up 146% year-over-year. We are now generally available with both Cloud Volumes Service and Cloud Volumes ONTAP for all the leading hyperscale cloud providers: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. Additionally, we added cloud compliance as a feature to Cloud Volumes ONTAP, which help customers comply with today's privacy and other data regulations. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our cloud services as they enable us to acquire new customers and reach new buyers as well as expand the data sets managed at existing customers. Our deep integration for a broad and growing range of use cases with the leading public clouds and industry-leading technology for on-premises storage solutions gives us a sustainable competitive advantage. Let me share with you a few customer examples to illustrate how our data fabric strategy allows us to acquire new customers, expand our footprint at existing customers and increase our strategic value. A U.S.-based research hospital in one of our acquired districts chose to go with NetApp on-premises and in the cloud. Our ability to connect their data centers to each other and to multiple public cloud providers all with a consistent management interface placed us well ahead of the competition in addressing the customer's requirements. A global retailer and current NetApp customer has halted its on-premises IT spending in favor of a Cloud First Strategy. They plan to migrate their large SAP HANA environment to the cloud to gain flexibility and speed of scale using Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Azure NetApp Files, because of our ability to help the customer easily migrate to the cloud we will retain not only the data currently managed by NetApp in their data centers, but we will also move competitor's on-premises footprints onto NetApp in the cloud. And finally on our Q1 call, I told you that we were working with a Fortune 10 company to migrate its existing data centers to the cloud. That customer now has line of sight to move 100 petabytes of data, largely from our competitor systems to Azure NetApp Files. By partnering with them to achieve their cloud-first initiative, we have elevated NetApp from an infrastructure provider with a minority position in their data center to a key strategic partner. The power of our Data Fabric strategy increases our strategic relevance to customers which creates long-term value for NetApp and our shareholders. It enables us to reach new buyers through new pathways address new workloads and expand our presence with existing customers and it drives our innovation agenda which we advanced significantly in the quarter. We are delivering an enormous amount of value to a growing number of customers. Only NetApp has the strategy, the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multi-cloud IT. Our strong business model resulting from the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and our cost structure over the last several years enables us to navigate the dynamics of the macro economy and customer demand environment while making the strategic investments necessary to cement our leadership in hybrid cloud data services. With that I'll turn it over to Ron for more details on the quarter and our expectations. Ron?\nRon Pasek: Thanks, George. As a reminder I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers, unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, in Q3 we delivered solid margins and operating leverage in the face of revenue weakness. Despite the demand uncertainty, we generated strong free cash flow and remain confident in our product leadership and strategy to reaccelerate growth going forward. Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q3 performance. In Q3 net revenues of $1.4 billion decreased 10% year-over-year. We had zero ELA revenue in the quarter, although we had expected approximately $50 million. Product revenue of $787 million, decreased approximately 19% year-over-year. Moving down to P&L. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $556 million was up nearly 5% year-over-year with better execution in our renewals business starting to deliver results. Deferred revenue increased 6% year-over-year in Q3. Gross margin of 67.8% was above our guidance. Product gross margin was 55.4%, which is an increase of 2.8 points year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement was driven by continued sales force discipline an increase in all-flash product mix and cost reductions. Q3 was the 12th straight quarter we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs. The Q2 to Q3 seasonal decrease in product margins was driven by customer and product mix. We've seen almost no degradation in product margins as a result of increased NAND pricing. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 83.6% increased nearly 200 basis points year-over-year driven by continued productivity improvements. Q3 operating expenses of $640 million, increased approximately 2% year-over-year, driven by annual merit increases. Operating margin was 22.2% and in line with our guidance. EPS of $1.16 was down 3% year-over-year but well within the guidance range. We closed Q3 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a positive one day, an increase of 12 days year-over-year. DSO of 53 days was up two days year-over-year. DIO was 22 days an increase of seven days year-over-year. And DPO was 75 days, down three days year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $420 million. Free cash flow was $388 million representing 28% of revenue. We are maintaining our expectation for free cash flow to be in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues in fiscal 2020. During Q3, we repurchased 8.2 million shares at an average price of $61.20 for a total of $500 million. As of the end of Q3, we had $640 million remaining on our original $4 billion buyback authorization. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 229 million, down 26 million shares year-on-year, representing a 10% decrease. During the quarter we paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $608 million to shareholders in the quarter. Our fiscal Q4 cash dividend will be $0.48 per share. Now on to guidance. As we've noted over the past several quarters, the demand environment continues to be challenged. As a result, we expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 4% decline in revenues year-over-year including 0.5 point of currency headwind. Consistent with normal seasonal sequential decline in gross margin from Q3 to Q4 associated with product revenue being a larger portion of the overall revenue mix, we expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67%. We expect Q4 operating margin to range between 23% and 24%. We expect earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.28 and $1.36 per share which at the midpoint implies an 8% increase year-over-year. The midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance implies that total fiscal 2020 revenue will be down 10% with ELAs being approximately 1% of total revenues. Our Q4 guidance also implies fiscal 2020 gross margin of 67% to 68% and operating margin of approximately 21%. We expect fiscal 2020 EPS to be down approximately 7% year-over-year and within the range we guided last quarter. As George noted, we are seeing early signs of success from our strategic investments in sales coverage, which provides confidence in our ability to return the company to long-term growth. I want to again thank the NetApp team, our shareholders, customers and partners for making the last four years a rewarding experience. With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Ron. We will now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Hey. Good afternoon. Thank you for letting me ask question. Ron, I guess, if -- I guess I'm not sure what we should assume for ELA revenue in the April quarter guide. But even if we were to back out ELA revenue in the guide it would seem that product gross margins will take a step down by a couple of hundred basis points. And so I guess am I missing something? And then secondarily is that -- would that be based on component cost headwinds from NAND? Or are there other manufacturing costs we should be thinking about? Thank you. \nRon Pasek: Thanks, Karl. So as you know we don't guide product margins discretely. But what we do have is about 1% of ELAs for the year in Q4 as opposed to what we had before is 2%. There's a lot of other -- so first of all in -- with respect to component costs it is a very small amount we saw quarter-to-quarter from Q2 to Q3. That was -- a headwind to gross margin was 0.1% so -- but there's a whole lot of other mix, right? There's mix by product. If we have a higher flash mix it tends to help margin all things being equal. We have higher software mix that helps gross margin. So there's a lot of dynamics under there. I wouldn't read anything into it with respect to component costs.\nGeorge Kurian: I think with regard to the Q4 guide, the gross margin picture is affected by the fact that the mix between products and services leans more to products than it did in Q3. That's the typical seasonality that we see in the Q4 seasonal pattern. So we are not seeing anything specific other than just the mix of product and services being a little different than it was this quarter.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you. Best of luck, Ron and thanks. It's great to meet you and hopeful as well. Thank you. \nRon Pasek: Thanks Karl.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Karl. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.\nRod Hall: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Congratulations on the retirement Ron. Good working with you. And I wanted to just go back to these ELAs. I'm calculating if you're saying 1% of full year revenue I mean the exact calculation on that's about $55 million. I'm assuming this is a rough estimate it could be $50 million. But just three months ago you guys thought it'd be $100 million. And I'm just wondering what -- why you continue to think you've got visibility here and we have so much uncertainty on these ELAs and why include them in the guidance given all that.\nRon Pasek: We can see some of them. They're still difficult to predict but they always were back-end loaded so some of the ones that we expect in Q4 probably going to slip out of the year. That's really it. But it's a very different year than last year. Last year they're front-end loaded. This year they're back-end loaded. As we told you they're difficult to predict in a quarter. And then if they come at the end of the year they're difficult to predict than they're going to come in the year. So it's just that simple. Having said all that, we still are really happy with the gross margin performance of the underlying product revenue. It's very strong. It won't be a headwind because of [indiscernible] ELAs year-to-year.\nGeorge Kurian: I think as Ron said Rod these ELAs are meant to make it easier for the customer to buy and they benefit from the structure of the ELAs to being able to buy more product more easily. We've always said they are choppy and hard to predict. We have deep engagements with the customers that we are structuring ELAs with. And we had we thought one in the quarter that has moved out and that's why we've also taken down the range from 2% to 1%. So we're trying to do the best we can to give you a view of what's available and we're balancing that with the probability that some of them may not happen in the year.\nRod Hall: Could you guys elaborate -- I mean you say it's one George. Is this just a few ELA deals that would have amounted to $100 million? So the $55 million maybe that's a couple of deals? Or can you give us any idea on that?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think these are by nature large transactions with a very few customers, right? It's -- 1% or 2% of our total revenue is not a large number and the number of those transactions are very, very few. So each of them are lumpy, hard to predict and sizable and I'll just leave it there Rod.\nRod Hall: Okay. All right, thank you guys.\nKris Newton: Thanks Rod. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi, thank you. I know you just guided Q4, but can you give us any sense at all on how we should look at fiscal 2021? You have NAND pricing moving up again, your compares are quite easy, cloud data services seems to be doing better. Can you give us some guidepost on fiscal 2021? Talk about maybe at least some of the puts and takes on revenue and also on gross margins, if you could please?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, let me just kind of - we're not going to guide the next fiscal year. We'll give you that guidance when we actually guide it. I could tell you that first of all the investments we are making in additional sales coverage, we are on-track against our target of 200 incremental sales headcount covering new accounts and driving customer acquisition by the end of Q1 fiscal year 2020. It takes those sales reps roughly four quarters to get productive, so the majority of the productivity will show up next year which should drive the year-on-year model to be favorable relative to what we had this year. And we are seeing the early payoff of some of the investments, we made in acquisition accounts and acquisition districts as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, showing up positively and accelerating through the course of the year. With regard to product gross margins as Ron mentioned, we have been maintaining strong margins across the board both on product and services reflecting the differentiation of our offerings, the work that we've done in terms of driving productivity in the business and the discipline of our sales force to capture the full value of our offerings. And we think that regardless of the ELA picture, we have a sound business model on the gross margin side. We have been disciplined in our operating expenses. As we said, we have outlaid the sales headcount without adding to the operating expense structure of the company. And we'll tell you more about our plans for how we continue to be disciplined on operating expenses next year. But overall the business model of the company is a strong one. I have every confidence that on the top line the investments we're making this year together with our really strong product portfolio should drive positive territory next year.\nWamsi Mohan: George, appreciate that color. If I could really quick? On the ELAs what is the hesitancy that you're seeing at the customer base particularly because they don't necessarily have to shell out the cash upfront? So why is this not an indication that they're kicking the tires around other products? Or how should people read this hesitancy around signing ELAs?\nGeorge Kurian: I think first of all with regard to our competitive position, the data that we mentioned about our ability to win new accounts and gain share in new districts proves that we have strong competitive positions. With regard to these accounts that we are doing ELA discussions with we are deeply, deeply involved in those accounts. We've got many years of experience dealing with them and we don't see that they're headed to an alternate architecture or alternate buying motion. I think these transactions are complex. They require coordination across many departments and the customer. We've always been transparent about the fact that they're lumpy, right? And there's very few of them. So my own view is ELAs are 1% to 2% of our business. The majority of the business is extremely healthy. These customers that we are in discussions with we have other ways to pursue meeting their needs beyond the ELAs and we are using that in other parts of some of these accounts. So we'll tell you more as the ELAs come through and we get more visibility into some of these discussions going forward.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks Wamsi. Next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you, good afternoon. Just looking at the product revenue trajectory, the decline accelerated in the January quarter, despite an easier compare, can you just talk about where you saw some of the incremental weakness in January?\nGeorge Kurian: Well I think the ELA was a contributing factor to the decline. I think, if ELA had been -- had come in I think the picture would have been quite different Katy. I think with regard to the weakness in product revenue which continues to be in the largest enterprises, as we have said those are the ones that are most affected by uncertain macroeconomic buying conditions. And we are trying to balance our exposure to those accounts by acquiring new accounts. We've seen good results from that. And hopefully those two lines should cross over at some point in the near future.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Ron, congratulations on your retirement.\nRon Pasek: Thanks Katy.\nKris Newton: Thanks Katy. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.\nTim Long: Thank you. Congratulations as well, Ron. Yeah. George and Ron, I just wanted to ask about the Cloud Data Services business. It is kind of moving higher. But it seems like the last few quarters, you've been adding more partners that you GA add and more products and solutions. And I think, we're at pretty much four quarters in a row where the -- kind of the sequential growth was about $10 million give or take $1 million, in that line. So, could you just talk a little bit about what you think, it will take for that line to inflect, a little bit more? Or is it more experience with the partners or other products? Or what do you think it will be that will make that line start to move a little more aggressively higher? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks for the question. There are two things that we believe will allow us to move that lineup. I think the first is we continue to do enablement and training. And we are acquiring more new customers, every single day. These workloads or applications that we serve in the public cloud, they are important applications, right? They're mission-critical applications, high-performance applications. And so it takes a while for the customer to get comfortable with the usage of our technology, before they adopt and expand. We are seeing some of the early customers who did proof of concepts with us, started to move some workloads. And now is starting to broaden their book of business. So that will take a little bit of ramp time. The second is, due to overwhelming demand. And the fact that operationally, we are in the early phases of a multi-region global rollout. We have a process that we've agreed on with the hyperscale cloud provider, which is we call -- which they call white-listing, where the customer requires a registration for us to manually approve them being onboarded. We are in a window where we're working hard to remove white-listing. And that will allow us to scale, demand more -- in a much more automated fashion. So those are the two key things that we need to get through to be able to scale it even faster.\nTim Long: Okay. And I assume we're still on track with the long-term targets here?\nGeorge Kurian: We have clearly signs of the favorable demand patterns. And as we see that the market opportunity is clearly there to get. And that's clearly our goal and intent. As we said, we are about a year behind where we wanted to be because of the time. It's taken us to get these services to production readiness, and so we're going to continue to push to see, how we can get to that target. And we'll keep you updated on progress.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Tim, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question and also congratulations Ron. It's been great working with you. I apologize to go back to this discussion. But maybe just trying to understand the math a little bit more given I think the questions I'll get is, if I look at the lumpiness in the ELA business. And I appreciate that that lumpiness will continue. I think it's important to kind of understand, what you're saying about the gross margin. So, if I assume the ELA gross margin is close to 100%, it seems like your implicit guide on gross margin is back into the mid-65% range. So I guess, what I'm asking is, what am I missing? And I can appreciate the mix of the business is a variable, in the April quarter. But I'm just trying to think about if ELAs aren't there, how do we think about that gross margin structure going through the course of the next couple of quarters?\nRon Pasek: So, we guided gross margin for the quarter between 66% and 67%. Last quarter for Q3, it was closer to 68%. You have a higher mix of product revenue, in Q4. That's the biggest degradation to margins. There's a -- without going into a specific number the product margin guide employed in that, is actually higher than Q3 because of the ELA. So I think, it just -- you can't see all this. But I'm telling you it actually all holds together. So...\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And the ELA -- yeah, I know that ELA attributes there's affects that after the upfront software contributions. And actually you have some hardware-only revenue that kicks in, that has lower margins. That's not a variable at this point?\nRon Pasek: That's right. That's kind of the variable. You've got -- as I said earlier, you have a mix now. We didn't historically have a mix difference in margin between all-flash. And hybrid and now we do. There's a big difference between, what you sell at all-flash in the margin versus hybrid. Plus, the mix of software is a wild card. So last quarter in Q3 we saw software being less of the total than we did in Q2. And that was a little bit of the degradation. So there's a lot of dynamics, going on under there.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. Thank you very much.\nRon Pasek: Sure.\nKris Newton: All right, thanks, Aaron. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my questions. Ron, it was very nice working you. And good luck with your next endeavor. George, when I look at your guide for the April quarter. And I'd just make some assumption for the all-flash array. It seems like you're going to exit FY 2020 with a high single-digit decline, in all-flash array revenues. So as you reposition the sales force and you reload, how should we think about the embedded growth assumption for this particular area of flash array? Are we going to -- are we set out for double-digit growth? And if so, what gives you the confidence other than just hiring 200 more salespeople? And I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: I think this year the all-flash array business has been affected in two dimensions. One was the fact that our largest customers who were most impacted by the macro were heavily all-flash customers. So from a product mix perspective, the fact that our biggest accounts underperformed or bought less impacted our all-flash business more substantially than it impacted pretty much every other product in the company. The second is that the ELAs were also heavily all-flash-oriented. So both of those have been contributing factors to the year-on-year declines in the all-flash category. We expect the work that we're doing with the deployment of additional sales force, resources as well as focusing our compensation plans and our sales objectives on returning to growth in the all-flash category to be able to drive our business at and above market growth rates. And we'll tell you more about that as we issue the FY 2021 guide. But we are taking actions to focus our sales force on the best-in-class product in the all-flash category which is ours right? And we have every confidence that we should be able to meet or beat the market next year.\nMehdi Hosseini: Sure. And a quick follow-up. I understand ELAs have a material impact on product margin. But excluding ELA, NAND prices are going to go up and they're going to go up much higher than where they are today. So how are you able to manage product gross margin independent of ELA? Because I perceive ELAs as volatile and there's no way I could model that. So I just want to think about the increase in bill of material and how you're going to be able to manage that?\nRon Pasek: So Mehdi, two things: number one is as you saw this quarter I think quarter-to-quarter NAND prices went up about 4% and have a very minimal effect on our gross margin, because contrary to popular belief not a big huge portion of the COGS in our system is actually NAND, right? A lot of it's software, a lot of it's other parts. So I think what you should see this year is -- you're right, this year we should project to see NAND go up, but it won't have a huge material effect on gross margin because there's a lot of other components.\nMehdi Hosseini: And is that because you're able to -- that there's another replacement cycle coming? Is there a premium? Because on the margin NAND is going higher. I understand NAND is a small portion, but it's still going higher.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen I think first of all for the drives in our platforms we typically pass the cost on to our customers, right? I think NAND is not an embedded component of our system, it is a consumable that we pass on to customers and so we don't try to mask the commodities in terms of the drives in our system. And so there will be -- at some point, as the market adjusts upward, if that is the trajectory, we're going to be discrete about making sure that we pass on some of that to our customers, right? And so we've had that history. I think the industry as a whole has had that history. And we'll disclose it when we do it, right? I think with regard to product gross margins they've been strong this year and even without ELAs because of the fact that our sales force has been enabled and we know how to sell the value of our offerings. A substantial portion of that value is actually software that both makes our systems the most efficient in the industry, but also allows our customers to uniquely take advantage of hybrid cloud capability that nobody else in the industry has. And so we are differentiated in software. That's proven out in the ability to hold gross margins in a tough economic environment.\nMehdi Hosseini: Clear. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Great. Thanks, Mehdi. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Cabral: Yeah. Thank you. George, can you just talk a little bit about the wider demand environment that you're seeing and if it's changed at all versus the prior few quarters? And then I guess given it's been about a year since you've been calling out macro as a headwind what gives you confidence that these larger deals are just actually being pushed as opposed to either competitive losses or some sort of a secular shift in customers thinking about their on-prem footprint more broadly?\nGeorge Kurian: So we saw the first signs of the macro being a little bit more choppy was about a year ago in January. We saw a substantial step-down from that level of uncertainty into a much more sort of uncertain environment in Q1. I think from Q1 -- of our fiscal Q1. I think from then on it's stayed relatively in the same territory. I wouldn't say it has gotten worse. It is reflective of three or four key things. I think the first is buying cycles are longer and the amount of spend per transaction is smaller. I think we have consistently seen a higher rate and number of transactions across a broader range of accounts, especially as we've added sales capacity through the year. And so, that's indications that we can win in net new accounts, but that the average transaction size is more muted. You also see the fact as we've said where people are buying for now versus buying capacity for the long-term. Even though you hand people incentives to buy a larger transaction, they're more sort of comfortable buying for the short-term. Those are some of the key things. With regard to what gives us confidence that we can return to growth, listen I think first of all, we have relatively easy compares in the first half of next year. We've put in capacity ahead of that window to get our sales teams productive. We've got work to do to enable all the 200 that we put in place. But the results from the new deployments of resources in terms of customer wins, units, sales volume, use cases, have all been really encouraging. With regard to these large customers that we are engaged with, we have deep relationships with them. We know when they're making an architectural choice to go to the cloud, because we are an intimate part of those cloud discussions with many. And frankly, as we said in our prepared remarks, some of them going to cloud might be a near-term hindrance to revenue growth, but they give us a much broader revenue opportunity in the medium-term, right? We mentioned the Fortune 10 company, which as they've moved to cloud has given us a maybe 3 to 4 times larger opportunity than we had on premises. And so, we're excited about that opportunity in those accounts that are choosing to move to cloud.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.\nAnanda Baruah: Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. Ron, from me as well congratulations, it's been great working with you. Really enjoyed it.\nRon Pasek: Thank you. Appreciate that.\nAnanda Baruah: Yeah. You're welcome. George, I know you just said that you don't -- at least broadly speaking you don't think that you're seeing the spending environment get more challenging. Could you -- like, if I back out the ELAs from the strategic revenue, you put up slightly sort of more favorable declines in the Jan quarter, but it was off a meaningfully easier compare. And so, I don't know. The numbers seem to suggest that like maybe there is some incremental interference in the spending environment. So, I just want to run that by you and just make sure that I understood your comment accurately. And then, I'm just going to add one more in there too. Do you feel like with the new sales force ramp-on that you're where you -- from a productivity perspective, that you're where you want it to be at this point? If you could update us there. Just I think we're all just looking for kind of context around the -- not just the product revenue, but the strategic product revenue spending dynamic sense.\nGeorge Kurian : Listen, I think that we're seeing the environment is choppy, right? We are seeing that customer spending, enterprise IT spending for on-premises data centers is choppy and that has been true for a few quarters now. Do I have enough data to say, it's a shade better or a shade worse? I don't have that data right? I'm just saying it is pretty choppy and uncertain. I think with regard to the sales force productivity, we've always said it's between three and four quarters, roughly four quarters for a new account manager to be fully trained and equipped and ready. We said that we would be adding increments of 50 headcount starting in Q2 of fiscal year 2020 and finishing at the end of Q1 fiscal year 2021. So we would have four chunks of that. We are on track with the hiring, and we're working hard on enablement, right? And so, I think if you do the math the majority of the productivity impact of that headcount is actually next fiscal year. And listen, we'd love to move the productivity impact earlier and we're doing everything we can, but I think that's where you should reasonably model it.\nAnanda Baruah: Okay. Okay, great. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Ananda. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. I wanted to ask about any potential impact you're seeing from the coronavirus in your supply chain, given that most of your key suppliers are in Asia, in China. So, any constraints there? Or given that you're still early in the quarter, and you tend to be more back-end loaded by the time you get through the quarter that shouldn't be an issue?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, our Q4 revenue guide does not include any disruption to our supply chain from the coronavirus. So far, two elements of our business and their potential impact on coronavirus, right? On the demand side, we don't have a large business in China. We, as you know, prosecute that business through a joint venture with Lenovo, who are the distributors of our technology in China. Our customers are -- do large amounts of business in China, so I would model on the demand side that our impact to us is a second-order derivative, right? With regard to the supply side, with regard to our supply chain, yes, we like others have supply base that is built \u2013 that has a meaningful footprint in China. And we are working pretty hard on contingency planning to minimize disruptions. So far, we have not seen any, but I think there's probably likely some and we're working hard to minimize that.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats Ron on your retirement. I'm thinking you might have a future as a NAND analyst going forward. You may not like the job. In terms of questions, I was just curious this may be in the rounding of the numbers but it looks like sales through channel the channel were a little weaker year-over-year. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about that? And also a similar question on the public sector markets was there any changes relative to your expectations there? It seemed like it came off a regular sort of end to the \u2013 their October fiscal year? Thank you.\nRon Pasek: So with respect to the mix of channel, I mean, that vacillates \u2013 it's usually 80/20 as vacillates around that mean. There's nothing underlying there that was \u2013 is permanent or unusual.\nSteven Fox: Okay. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to the public sector business mostly performed according to plan. I think we saw a pretty normal pattern of business in our public sector.\nSteven Fox: And just as a follow-up to that any initiatives to sort of maybe reaccelerate your business there? I know, one of your smaller competitors has been focusing on that area. Do you see that as a threat? Or is this more just tied to general budgets?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think we have a variety of ways to broaden our relevance in the public sector. We are working with some of our cloud provider partners to be part of their initiatives and to serve our men and women in uniform in new and interesting ways. So we'll tell you more about that as we bring those to market.\nSteven Fox: Okay. Thank you very much.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Steve. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva: Thanks very much. George, if I remember right, it was approximately six months ago you'd mentioned about increasing sales force by 200 and you mentioned it again. I was just wondering, is the tempo or the cadence of that going faster than expected in line with expected slower than expected? Because what I'm trying to do is figure out the softer guidance. Is it being impacted at all by that sales force transition? Or is it more macro and just longer decision-making time lines? Thank you so much.\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to the sales force, we said that we would add 200 incremental sales resources to allow us to acquire new customers. We laid that out in four quarters sort of saying that we would start in Q2 of fiscal \u2013 of this fiscal year and finish at the end of Q1 of fiscal year 2021, and we are on track. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are bringing good candidates on board and we are generally on track. We also said that it would take a typical new sales rep about four quarters to get productive. So if you do the math, the majority of the benefits of that investment really are next year, right? With regard to Q4, the change or the softness is really for us being a little bit more conservative on ELAs going from previously what we thought would be 2% down to 1% maybe a shade below 1% in that range, right? And so I think that's the majority of the change between what you saw previously and what you see now.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much for the clarifications and detail that's greatly appreciated. And Ron we'll greatly miss you.\nRon Pasek: Thank you. Appreciate it, Jim.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Jim. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you for taking the question and Ron congratulations on the retirement. I wanted to see if we can maybe talk about your overall philosophy regarding return of capital. You've been buying back a lot of stock another $500 million this quarter paying a good dividend over $100 million. And so you've been exceeding your free cash flow and you're almost out of the authorized $600 million. So I assume you're going to update us on that at some point. But I guess what I'm trying to get to is the long-term philosophy. And does the transition of CFO mean that you'll want to wait for the new CFO to set a philosophy? Or how are you thinking? Thank you.\nRon Pasek: Well, yeah, I think it's going to coincide with the change in the fiscal year, when we give the guide. Obviously, we'll give some clarity around what would happen to the capital allocation policy. But the dividend is permanent that's not going to change. If anything it's going to go up as we proceed from here on out. And to your point, we're almost done with the $4 billion share repurchase. So you could see that getting to an end fairly soon and the company will probably re-clarify what the next tranche will be going forward. And I'll let my successor determine that with George.\nGeorge Kurian: I'll just say that Ron and I have had a common philosophy and a shared one around the sources and uses of cash. I don't think you should see a radical departure from our belief that cash is an important asset for both investing in the long-term health of the business and in terms of providing returns to shareholders. So, I don't think that you should see us make a radical departure from that philosophy going forward.\nSimon Leopold: Great. Thank you. That's helpful.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks Simon. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital Markets.\nLou Miscioscia: Okay. Thank you. Ron, best of luck it's good having you. So, I wanted to just and I went back further 10 years, but really want to focus on the last seven years. If I take out the ELAs for the quarter just to look at product revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the average growth is actually about $39 million if I'm getting this all right. And with that four out of the last seven actually were material misses and the other three were just basically hitting let's say $73 million to $77 million quarter-to-quarter. So, I guess, I'd be just a little worried on even this lower product revenue taking out ELAs. So, again, given the choppy environment and all the uncertainty, why would we -- why would you be able to hit that midpoint?\nGeorge Kurian: You're talking about Q4?\nLou Miscioscia: Q4 over Q3, yes, sequential growth of product revenue to get to the -- if I'm modeling very easily software maintenance and services, I don't think they're hard to model. And thus when I look at product revenue, I take out the $50 million, again, it seems like your average was $39 million quarter-to-quarter.\nGeorge Kurian: So, Q4 has always been the strongest quarter in terms of a year-end finish for our sales force. I think we have done a good amount of work in terms of looking at our pipeline. And we're not saying that the guide isn't requires really good execution and it doesn't require disruption due to coronavirus or anything else. But I think that we're counting on the fact that we are at the end of a fiscal year and Q4 is the quarter that those sales reps that are in the money are going to bring in transactions, right? I think that's the short summary. I think like all plans we go into the quarter looking at our pipeline looking at close rates looking at how many transactions that are high probability medium probability low probability are required to get in these numbers and we've done that work. It is a choppy environment. And so we've tried to be cautious around the probabilities, but we've done -- we're doing as much due diligence as we can with regard to the quality of the bookings forecast that we give you.\nLou Miscioscia: Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks Lou. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital Markets.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes, you've given us some good clarity on the sales hiring effort. I was just curious where did our headcount finish up for January 31st? And where do you expect it ending the fiscal year?\nRon Pasek: So, it was roughly flat. It hasn't changed all that much. We -- you know we haven't been in a hiring mode except on the salesforce side. We're holding OpEx essentially flat this fiscal year. Some of that is variable comp, but it obviously implies that we're not adding a lot of people just in certain areas and rather surgically.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. You guys normally have a college hiring cycle that would probably bring on people in Q1. Are you continuing to pursue that or are you -- has that been kind of suspended?\nRon Pasek: No, that's ongoing.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks Eric. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.\nNik Todorov: Hi guys. Good afternoon. George we're continuing -- we're hearing that HCI Systems are displacing more and more traditional servers and storage systems. So, I get that that suggests that the market could be moving to that enterprise scale applications that your product addresses. But can you provide us with your outlook for 2020 in terms of -- do you expect to see an inflection in your HCI revenue in the next year?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen HCI addresses some of the use cases in the customers' data center, particularly ones that are single application use. I think that we have a good offering. It's differentiated for mixed workloads and has several elements for customers who require good data management capabilities even in a single application use. And we're focusing our efforts in HCI in that part of the market. We don't see HCI displacing sort of the core of solid-state storage right? I think fiber channel storage as well as high-performance scale-out NFS storage has still got actually many, many applications in the data center. And our original view that HCI might displace those isn't being proven true. And I think you'll see us push aggressively with our flash and hybrid flash products to address those use cases.\nNik Todorov: Got it. If I can follow up just quickly are you willing to share what percent of customers are still at a proof-of-concept stage with CDS?\nGeorge Kurian: No, it's too early to comment on that. I think I would just tell you the majority of our customers today on CDS are in early production, right? So, they're in -- you could say they're in proof-of-concept of their first application deployment on our platform. And they might be in production on that application, but that's the first of many. They want to move to that platform. So broadly speaking, until we sort of remove ungated demand, which is removing what we call white-listing, every customer is in sort of a proof-of-concept mode. And once we remove that, you should be able to see much more automated onboarding of customers to that platform.\nNick Todorov: Got it. Thanks guys. Good luck Ron.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Nick. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. And best of luck Ron. George, could you maybe give us a bit more color on trends in North America? Are there any areas where you're seeing market share gains from a workload perspective? Are you starting to see any benefit from the streamlined purchasing model?\nGeorge Kurian: I think with regard to the use of consumption and consumption-based offerings we see that our cloud data services plus managed services from partners are really good opportunities for customers to get going with us in a consumption offering. I think we made our subscription type model available. We're seeing early interest that's very healthy, and we are working with a small group of customers on proof-of-concepts getting them on board and going from there. With regard to the streamlined pricing and packaging of our platforms, I think that's a big part of why product gross margins continue to be healthy, right? I think that customers are able to understand the value that we offer in a much more streamlined way than we historically used to. And so it's another support element for product gross margins helping our sales force establish value with customers. With regard to some of the shifts we see going on in the market, as I mentioned, we are participating with the hyperscaler cloud providers in new market opportunities and especially in the public sector market. We'll tell you more about it as those become real, but they expand our total addressable market opportunity in a way that we didn't before.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, George. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim.\nNehal Chokshi: Yeah. Thank you. The year-over-year trajectory on the hardware maintenance went from declining mid single-digits to flat. Is there a narrative behind that?\nRon Pasek: Yeah. So actually if you remember even in Q1 and Q2 adjusting for currency, we were flat. This quarter it's up about 5%. What I tried to put in my prepared remarks and we've actually started to see the benefits of some of the work, we've been doing on renewals, so it's finally starting to pay off. Better renewal rates, better structures, better pricing, better discounting, so you'll have to wait until next year, but that's actually a bright spot that trend line is actually in really good shape.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks Nehal. I'm going to pass it back to George for some final comments.\nGeorge Kurian: Our Data Fabric strategy is creating value for our customers NetApp and our investors. Only NetApp has the strategy the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multi-cloud IT. All these integration with the leading public clouds and industry-leading technology for on-premises storage solutions gives us a sustainable competitive advantage. We'll continue our strong focus on operational discipline, which enables us to make the strategic investments in sales coverage, customer experience and hybrid multi-cloud solutions needed to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. We are seeing early signs of success by getting in front of more customers, which gives me confidence that our investments will pay off in future growth. Thank you all and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron Pasek",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation for the opportunity to work alongside the talented team here at NetApp. These past four years have been incredibly rewarding. The team has proved to be collaborative, innovative and empowering and I'm proud of what we have achieved during my time here. I also want to thank the investor and analyst community as it's been a genuine pleasure working with all of you. This is an exciting time for our industry and for NetApp, and I look forward to helping our next CFO transition into the role. Thanks, George. As a reminder I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers, unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, in Q3 we delivered solid margins and operating leverage in the face of revenue weakness. Despite the demand uncertainty, we generated strong free cash flow and remain confident in our product leadership and strategy to reaccelerate growth going forward. Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q3 performance. In Q3 net revenues of $1.4 billion decreased 10% year-over-year. We had zero ELA revenue in the quarter, although we had expected approximately $50 million. Product revenue of $787 million, decreased approximately 19% year-over-year. Moving down to P&L. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $556 million was up nearly 5% year-over-year with better execution in our renewals business starting to deliver results. Deferred revenue increased 6% year-over-year in Q3. Gross margin of 67.8% was above our guidance. Product gross margin was 55.4%, which is an increase of 2.8 points year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement was driven by continued sales force discipline an increase in all-flash product mix and cost reductions. Q3 was the 12th straight quarter we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs. The Q2 to Q3 seasonal decrease in product margins was driven by customer and product mix. We've seen almost no degradation in product margins as a result of increased NAND pricing. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 83.6% increased nearly 200 basis points year-over-year driven by continued productivity improvements. Q3 operating expenses of $640 million, increased approximately 2% year-over-year, driven by annual merit increases. Operating margin was 22.2% and in line with our guidance. EPS of $1.16 was down 3% year-over-year but well within the guidance range. We closed Q3 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a positive one day, an increase of 12 days year-over-year. DSO of 53 days was up two days year-over-year. DIO was 22 days an increase of seven days year-over-year. And DPO was 75 days, down three days year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $420 million. Free cash flow was $388 million representing 28% of revenue. We are maintaining our expectation for free cash flow to be in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues in fiscal 2020. During Q3, we repurchased 8.2 million shares at an average price of $61.20 for a total of $500 million. As of the end of Q3, we had $640 million remaining on our original $4 billion buyback authorization. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 229 million, down 26 million shares year-on-year, representing a 10% decrease. During the quarter we paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $608 million to shareholders in the quarter. Our fiscal Q4 cash dividend will be $0.48 per share. Now on to guidance. As we've noted over the past several quarters, the demand environment continues to be challenged. As a result, we expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 4% decline in revenues year-over-year including 0.5 point of currency headwind. Consistent with normal seasonal sequential decline in gross margin from Q3 to Q4 associated with product revenue being a larger portion of the overall revenue mix, we expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67%. We expect Q4 operating margin to range between 23% and 24%. We expect earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.28 and $1.36 per share which at the midpoint implies an 8% increase year-over-year. The midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance implies that total fiscal 2020 revenue will be down 10% with ELAs being approximately 1% of total revenues. Our Q4 guidance also implies fiscal 2020 gross margin of 67% to 68% and operating margin of approximately 21%. We expect fiscal 2020 EPS to be down approximately 7% year-over-year and within the range we guided last quarter. As George noted, we are seeing early signs of success from our strategic investments in sales coverage, which provides confidence in our ability to return the company to long-term growth. I want to again thank the NetApp team, our shareholders, customers and partners for making the last four years a rewarding experience. With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Thanks, Karl. So as you know we don't guide product margins discretely. But what we do have is about 1% of ELAs for the year in Q4 as opposed to what we had before is 2%. There's a lot of other -- so first of all in -- with respect to component costs it is a very small amount we saw quarter-to-quarter from Q2 to Q3. That was -- a headwind to gross margin was 0.1% so -- but there's a whole lot of other mix, right? There's mix by product. If we have a higher flash mix it tends to help margin all things being equal. We have higher software mix that helps gross margin. So there's a lot of dynamics under there. I wouldn't read anything into it with respect to component costs. Thanks Karl. We can see some of them. They're still difficult to predict but they always were back-end loaded so some of the ones that we expect in Q4 probably going to slip out of the year. That's really it. But it's a very different year than last year. Last year they're front-end loaded. This year they're back-end loaded. As we told you they're difficult to predict in a quarter. And then if they come at the end of the year they're difficult to predict than they're going to come in the year. So it's just that simple. Having said all that, we still are really happy with the gross margin performance of the underlying product revenue. It's very strong. It won't be a headwind because of [indiscernible] ELAs year-to-year. Thanks Katy. So, we guided gross margin for the quarter between 66% and 67%. Last quarter for Q3, it was closer to 68%. You have a higher mix of product revenue, in Q4. That's the biggest degradation to margins. There's a -- without going into a specific number the product margin guide employed in that, is actually higher than Q3 because of the ELA. So I think, it just -- you can't see all this. But I'm telling you it actually all holds together. So... That's right. That's kind of the variable. You've got -- as I said earlier, you have a mix now. We didn't historically have a mix difference in margin between all-flash. And hybrid and now we do. There's a big difference between, what you sell at all-flash in the margin versus hybrid. Plus, the mix of software is a wild card. So last quarter in Q3 we saw software being less of the total than we did in Q2. And that was a little bit of the degradation. So there's a lot of dynamics, going on under there. Sure. So Mehdi, two things: number one is as you saw this quarter I think quarter-to-quarter NAND prices went up about 4% and have a very minimal effect on our gross margin, because contrary to popular belief not a big huge portion of the COGS in our system is actually NAND, right? A lot of it's software, a lot of it's other parts. So I think what you should see this year is -- you're right, this year we should project to see NAND go up, but it won't have a huge material effect on gross margin because there's a lot of other components. Thank you. Appreciate that. So with respect to the mix of channel, I mean, that vacillates \u2013 it's usually 80/20 as vacillates around that mean. There's nothing underlying there that was \u2013 is permanent or unusual. Thank you. Appreciate it, Jim. Well, yeah, I think it's going to coincide with the change in the fiscal year, when we give the guide. Obviously, we'll give some clarity around what would happen to the capital allocation policy. But the dividend is permanent that's not going to change. If anything it's going to go up as we proceed from here on out. And to your point, we're almost done with the $4 billion share repurchase. So you could see that getting to an end fairly soon and the company will probably re-clarify what the next tranche will be going forward. And I'll let my successor determine that with George. So, it was roughly flat. It hasn't changed all that much. We -- you know we haven't been in a hiring mode except on the salesforce side. We're holding OpEx essentially flat this fiscal year. Some of that is variable comp, but it obviously implies that we're not adding a lot of people just in certain areas and rather surgically. No, that's ongoing. Yeah. So actually if you remember even in Q1 and Q2 adjusting for currency, we were flat. This quarter it's up about 5%. What I tried to put in my prepared remarks and we've actually started to see the benefits of some of the work, we've been doing on renewals, so it's finally starting to pay off. Better renewal rates, better structures, better pricing, better discounting, so you'll have to wait until next year, but that's actually a bright spot that trend line is actually in really good shape."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into our results for the third quarter I want to take a moment to talk about Ron. Today we announced that, Ron has decided to retire by the end of the fiscal year. I want to recognize his many contributions since joining NetApp in 2016. Under Ron's leadership, we have increased product margins by 10 points, nearly doubled our earnings power and raised our dividend by over 100%. He has played a pivotal role in helping NetApp navigate a transformational period as we focus on becoming the leader in hybrid cloud data services. I think you'll agree that he's always been a true and honest broker. Knowing that this is his last earnings call before he retires is certainly bittersweet for me. We continuously think about what's next for the company and that includes thoughtful proactive succession planning. To that end Ron and I have been talking about the prospect of this transition for some time. During the search process, we have been focused on finding the right person to take on the role of Chief Financial Officer, and I'm very pleased with the quality of candidates. I expect that we will have someone in the role before the end of the quarter. Ron will stay on to ensure a seamless transition and I'm grateful for that. Thank you, Ron. Now, let's turn to an overview of the quarter. Despite the top line challenges, we continued our operational discipline, highlighted by strong gross margin, cash flow and operating leverage without the benefit from anticipated ELA revenue in the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our business model as we take deliberate steps to better capitalize on our opportunity and return the company to growth. However, macroeconomic headwinds and unpredictability in large enterprise purchasing behavior persist. Customers are on a journey to the cloud and they are looking to NetApp to help them as they grapple with the complexities of data management in hybrid multi-cloud IT environments. With our Data Fabric strategy, we help customers address these challenges giving us access to new buyers and workloads, as well as increasing the relevance of NetApp to companies both large and small. We not only have opportunity in the public cloud, but we also have increased our value for on-premises deployments. Our ability to deliver real business value to customers' hybrid multi-cloud environments, fuels my confidence that we can return to growth. While we see exceptional opportunity ahead, we are planning our business assuming no change in external factors for the foreseeable future. To improve our execution in this environment, we laid out a plan at the start of the fiscal year to replicate our proven areas of success by getting in front of more buyers with our full portfolio. We are on track to increase sales capacity by approximately 200 primary sales resources by the end of Q1 fiscal year 2021 without adding to the total operating expenses for the company. The majority of the sales headcount will be deployed in our Americas geography. They will be focused on acquiring new accounts and engaging new buyers like cloud architects in existing accounts. We are seeing early signs of success by expanding our reach and focus on new customer acquisition. Our dedicated acquired districts continue to deliver strong growth across all metrics sales, units and customers. The growth of these metrics accelerated in Q3, as did the growth of the pipeline pointing to continued progress in coming quarters. While the acquired districts performed well, we still need to broaden our share of wallet at our largest customers. We are making progress here. However, it is in our largest accounts which have the greatest exposure to the macro that the demand environment is the least predictable. In Q3, our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services increased from Q2 to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.3 billion. We introduced new all-flash array and hybrid flash array platforms as well as a SAN-optimized all-flash array, which delivers a simplified and dedicated SAN experience. Our core storage offerings continue to gain industry accolades. Last quarter NetApp took the highest ranking in the leaders' quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for primary storage. In Q3, NetApp was named a leader in IDC's file-based storage MarketScape with the recommendation that customers in need of hybrid cloud solutions should consider NetApp, because of our expanded product portfolio investments and vision. Our building blocks for private cloud deployments SolidFire, NetApp HCI and StorageGRID enable customers to bring public cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. Our private cloud business, inclusive of products and services grew 10% from last quarter, attaining an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $350 million. To meet the increasing demand for Object Storage, NetApp announced new StorageGRID software platforms and the ability to tier to Azure Blob Storage. IDC named NetApp a leader in its object-based storage MarketScape citing our vast experience in unstructured data. They recommend customers consider StorageGRID, when dealing with petabyte-scale data sets across various deployment locations because of its unique hybrid multi-cloud integrations. Based on the last month of Q3, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to approximately $83 million, up 146% year-over-year. We are now generally available with both Cloud Volumes Service and Cloud Volumes ONTAP for all the leading hyperscale cloud providers: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. Additionally, we added cloud compliance as a feature to Cloud Volumes ONTAP, which help customers comply with today's privacy and other data regulations. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our cloud services as they enable us to acquire new customers and reach new buyers as well as expand the data sets managed at existing customers. Our deep integration for a broad and growing range of use cases with the leading public clouds and industry-leading technology for on-premises storage solutions gives us a sustainable competitive advantage. Let me share with you a few customer examples to illustrate how our data fabric strategy allows us to acquire new customers, expand our footprint at existing customers and increase our strategic value. A U.S.-based research hospital in one of our acquired districts chose to go with NetApp on-premises and in the cloud. Our ability to connect their data centers to each other and to multiple public cloud providers all with a consistent management interface placed us well ahead of the competition in addressing the customer's requirements. A global retailer and current NetApp customer has halted its on-premises IT spending in favor of a Cloud First Strategy. They plan to migrate their large SAP HANA environment to the cloud to gain flexibility and speed of scale using Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Azure NetApp Files, because of our ability to help the customer easily migrate to the cloud we will retain not only the data currently managed by NetApp in their data centers, but we will also move competitor's on-premises footprints onto NetApp in the cloud. And finally on our Q1 call, I told you that we were working with a Fortune 10 company to migrate its existing data centers to the cloud. That customer now has line of sight to move 100 petabytes of data, largely from our competitor systems to Azure NetApp Files. By partnering with them to achieve their cloud-first initiative, we have elevated NetApp from an infrastructure provider with a minority position in their data center to a key strategic partner. The power of our Data Fabric strategy increases our strategic relevance to customers which creates long-term value for NetApp and our shareholders. It enables us to reach new buyers through new pathways address new workloads and expand our presence with existing customers and it drives our innovation agenda which we advanced significantly in the quarter. We are delivering an enormous amount of value to a growing number of customers. Only NetApp has the strategy, the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multi-cloud IT. Our strong business model resulting from the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and our cost structure over the last several years enables us to navigate the dynamics of the macro economy and customer demand environment while making the strategic investments necessary to cement our leadership in hybrid cloud data services. With that I'll turn it over to Ron for more details on the quarter and our expectations. Ron? I think with regard to the Q4 guide, the gross margin picture is affected by the fact that the mix between products and services leans more to products than it did in Q3. That's the typical seasonality that we see in the Q4 seasonal pattern. So we are not seeing anything specific other than just the mix of product and services being a little different than it was this quarter. I think as Ron said Rod these ELAs are meant to make it easier for the customer to buy and they benefit from the structure of the ELAs to being able to buy more product more easily. We've always said they are choppy and hard to predict. We have deep engagements with the customers that we are structuring ELAs with. And we had we thought one in the quarter that has moved out and that's why we've also taken down the range from 2% to 1%. So we're trying to do the best we can to give you a view of what's available and we're balancing that with the probability that some of them may not happen in the year. Listen, I think these are by nature large transactions with a very few customers, right? It's -- 1% or 2% of our total revenue is not a large number and the number of those transactions are very, very few. So each of them are lumpy, hard to predict and sizable and I'll just leave it there Rod. Listen, let me just kind of - we're not going to guide the next fiscal year. We'll give you that guidance when we actually guide it. I could tell you that first of all the investments we are making in additional sales coverage, we are on-track against our target of 200 incremental sales headcount covering new accounts and driving customer acquisition by the end of Q1 fiscal year 2020. It takes those sales reps roughly four quarters to get productive, so the majority of the productivity will show up next year which should drive the year-on-year model to be favorable relative to what we had this year. And we are seeing the early payoff of some of the investments, we made in acquisition accounts and acquisition districts as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, showing up positively and accelerating through the course of the year. With regard to product gross margins as Ron mentioned, we have been maintaining strong margins across the board both on product and services reflecting the differentiation of our offerings, the work that we've done in terms of driving productivity in the business and the discipline of our sales force to capture the full value of our offerings. And we think that regardless of the ELA picture, we have a sound business model on the gross margin side. We have been disciplined in our operating expenses. As we said, we have outlaid the sales headcount without adding to the operating expense structure of the company. And we'll tell you more about our plans for how we continue to be disciplined on operating expenses next year. But overall the business model of the company is a strong one. I have every confidence that on the top line the investments we're making this year together with our really strong product portfolio should drive positive territory next year. I think first of all with regard to our competitive position, the data that we mentioned about our ability to win new accounts and gain share in new districts proves that we have strong competitive positions. With regard to these accounts that we are doing ELA discussions with we are deeply, deeply involved in those accounts. We've got many years of experience dealing with them and we don't see that they're headed to an alternate architecture or alternate buying motion. I think these transactions are complex. They require coordination across many departments and the customer. We've always been transparent about the fact that they're lumpy, right? And there's very few of them. So my own view is ELAs are 1% to 2% of our business. The majority of the business is extremely healthy. These customers that we are in discussions with we have other ways to pursue meeting their needs beyond the ELAs and we are using that in other parts of some of these accounts. So we'll tell you more as the ELAs come through and we get more visibility into some of these discussions going forward. Well I think the ELA was a contributing factor to the decline. I think, if ELA had been -- had come in I think the picture would have been quite different Katy. I think with regard to the weakness in product revenue which continues to be in the largest enterprises, as we have said those are the ones that are most affected by uncertain macroeconomic buying conditions. And we are trying to balance our exposure to those accounts by acquiring new accounts. We've seen good results from that. And hopefully those two lines should cross over at some point in the near future. Thanks for the question. There are two things that we believe will allow us to move that lineup. I think the first is we continue to do enablement and training. And we are acquiring more new customers, every single day. These workloads or applications that we serve in the public cloud, they are important applications, right? They're mission-critical applications, high-performance applications. And so it takes a while for the customer to get comfortable with the usage of our technology, before they adopt and expand. We are seeing some of the early customers who did proof of concepts with us, started to move some workloads. And now is starting to broaden their book of business. So that will take a little bit of ramp time. The second is, due to overwhelming demand. And the fact that operationally, we are in the early phases of a multi-region global rollout. We have a process that we've agreed on with the hyperscale cloud provider, which is we call -- which they call white-listing, where the customer requires a registration for us to manually approve them being onboarded. We are in a window where we're working hard to remove white-listing. And that will allow us to scale, demand more -- in a much more automated fashion. So those are the two key things that we need to get through to be able to scale it even faster. We have clearly signs of the favorable demand patterns. And as we see that the market opportunity is clearly there to get. And that's clearly our goal and intent. As we said, we are about a year behind where we wanted to be because of the time. It's taken us to get these services to production readiness, and so we're going to continue to push to see, how we can get to that target. And we'll keep you updated on progress. I think this year the all-flash array business has been affected in two dimensions. One was the fact that our largest customers who were most impacted by the macro were heavily all-flash customers. So from a product mix perspective, the fact that our biggest accounts underperformed or bought less impacted our all-flash business more substantially than it impacted pretty much every other product in the company. The second is that the ELAs were also heavily all-flash-oriented. So both of those have been contributing factors to the year-on-year declines in the all-flash category. We expect the work that we're doing with the deployment of additional sales force, resources as well as focusing our compensation plans and our sales objectives on returning to growth in the all-flash category to be able to drive our business at and above market growth rates. And we'll tell you more about that as we issue the FY 2021 guide. But we are taking actions to focus our sales force on the best-in-class product in the all-flash category which is ours right? And we have every confidence that we should be able to meet or beat the market next year. Listen I think first of all for the drives in our platforms we typically pass the cost on to our customers, right? I think NAND is not an embedded component of our system, it is a consumable that we pass on to customers and so we don't try to mask the commodities in terms of the drives in our system. And so there will be -- at some point, as the market adjusts upward, if that is the trajectory, we're going to be discrete about making sure that we pass on some of that to our customers, right? And so we've had that history. I think the industry as a whole has had that history. And we'll disclose it when we do it, right? I think with regard to product gross margins they've been strong this year and even without ELAs because of the fact that our sales force has been enabled and we know how to sell the value of our offerings. A substantial portion of that value is actually software that both makes our systems the most efficient in the industry, but also allows our customers to uniquely take advantage of hybrid cloud capability that nobody else in the industry has. And so we are differentiated in software. That's proven out in the ability to hold gross margins in a tough economic environment. So we saw the first signs of the macro being a little bit more choppy was about a year ago in January. We saw a substantial step-down from that level of uncertainty into a much more sort of uncertain environment in Q1. I think from Q1 -- of our fiscal Q1. I think from then on it's stayed relatively in the same territory. I wouldn't say it has gotten worse. It is reflective of three or four key things. I think the first is buying cycles are longer and the amount of spend per transaction is smaller. I think we have consistently seen a higher rate and number of transactions across a broader range of accounts, especially as we've added sales capacity through the year. And so, that's indications that we can win in net new accounts, but that the average transaction size is more muted. You also see the fact as we've said where people are buying for now versus buying capacity for the long-term. Even though you hand people incentives to buy a larger transaction, they're more sort of comfortable buying for the short-term. Those are some of the key things. With regard to what gives us confidence that we can return to growth, listen I think first of all, we have relatively easy compares in the first half of next year. We've put in capacity ahead of that window to get our sales teams productive. We've got work to do to enable all the 200 that we put in place. But the results from the new deployments of resources in terms of customer wins, units, sales volume, use cases, have all been really encouraging. With regard to these large customers that we are engaged with, we have deep relationships with them. We know when they're making an architectural choice to go to the cloud, because we are an intimate part of those cloud discussions with many. And frankly, as we said in our prepared remarks, some of them going to cloud might be a near-term hindrance to revenue growth, but they give us a much broader revenue opportunity in the medium-term, right? We mentioned the Fortune 10 company, which as they've moved to cloud has given us a maybe 3 to 4 times larger opportunity than we had on premises. And so, we're excited about that opportunity in those accounts that are choosing to move to cloud. Listen, I think that we're seeing the environment is choppy, right? We are seeing that customer spending, enterprise IT spending for on-premises data centers is choppy and that has been true for a few quarters now. Do I have enough data to say, it's a shade better or a shade worse? I don't have that data right? I'm just saying it is pretty choppy and uncertain. I think with regard to the sales force productivity, we've always said it's between three and four quarters, roughly four quarters for a new account manager to be fully trained and equipped and ready. We said that we would be adding increments of 50 headcount starting in Q2 of fiscal year 2020 and finishing at the end of Q1 fiscal year 2021. So we would have four chunks of that. We are on track with the hiring, and we're working hard on enablement, right? And so, I think if you do the math the majority of the productivity impact of that headcount is actually next fiscal year. And listen, we'd love to move the productivity impact earlier and we're doing everything we can, but I think that's where you should reasonably model it. Listen, our Q4 revenue guide does not include any disruption to our supply chain from the coronavirus. So far, two elements of our business and their potential impact on coronavirus, right? On the demand side, we don't have a large business in China. We, as you know, prosecute that business through a joint venture with Lenovo, who are the distributors of our technology in China. Our customers are -- do large amounts of business in China, so I would model on the demand side that our impact to us is a second-order derivative, right? With regard to the supply side, with regard to our supply chain, yes, we like others have supply base that is built \u2013 that has a meaningful footprint in China. And we are working pretty hard on contingency planning to minimize disruptions. So far, we have not seen any, but I think there's probably likely some and we're working hard to minimize that. With regard to the public sector business mostly performed according to plan. I think we saw a pretty normal pattern of business in our public sector. Listen, I think we have a variety of ways to broaden our relevance in the public sector. We are working with some of our cloud provider partners to be part of their initiatives and to serve our men and women in uniform in new and interesting ways. So we'll tell you more about that as we bring those to market. With regard to the sales force, we said that we would add 200 incremental sales resources to allow us to acquire new customers. We laid that out in four quarters sort of saying that we would start in Q2 of fiscal \u2013 of this fiscal year and finish at the end of Q1 of fiscal year 2021, and we are on track. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are bringing good candidates on board and we are generally on track. We also said that it would take a typical new sales rep about four quarters to get productive. So if you do the math, the majority of the benefits of that investment really are next year, right? With regard to Q4, the change or the softness is really for us being a little bit more conservative on ELAs going from previously what we thought would be 2% down to 1% maybe a shade below 1% in that range, right? And so I think that's the majority of the change between what you saw previously and what you see now. I'll just say that Ron and I have had a common philosophy and a shared one around the sources and uses of cash. I don't think you should see a radical departure from our belief that cash is an important asset for both investing in the long-term health of the business and in terms of providing returns to shareholders. So, I don't think that you should see us make a radical departure from that philosophy going forward. You're talking about Q4? So, Q4 has always been the strongest quarter in terms of a year-end finish for our sales force. I think we have done a good amount of work in terms of looking at our pipeline. And we're not saying that the guide isn't requires really good execution and it doesn't require disruption due to coronavirus or anything else. But I think that we're counting on the fact that we are at the end of a fiscal year and Q4 is the quarter that those sales reps that are in the money are going to bring in transactions, right? I think that's the short summary. I think like all plans we go into the quarter looking at our pipeline looking at close rates looking at how many transactions that are high probability medium probability low probability are required to get in these numbers and we've done that work. It is a choppy environment. And so we've tried to be cautious around the probabilities, but we've done -- we're doing as much due diligence as we can with regard to the quality of the bookings forecast that we give you. Listen HCI addresses some of the use cases in the customers' data center, particularly ones that are single application use. I think that we have a good offering. It's differentiated for mixed workloads and has several elements for customers who require good data management capabilities even in a single application use. And we're focusing our efforts in HCI in that part of the market. We don't see HCI displacing sort of the core of solid-state storage right? I think fiber channel storage as well as high-performance scale-out NFS storage has still got actually many, many applications in the data center. And our original view that HCI might displace those isn't being proven true. And I think you'll see us push aggressively with our flash and hybrid flash products to address those use cases. No, it's too early to comment on that. I think I would just tell you the majority of our customers today on CDS are in early production, right? So, they're in -- you could say they're in proof-of-concept of their first application deployment on our platform. And they might be in production on that application, but that's the first of many. They want to move to that platform. So broadly speaking, until we sort of remove ungated demand, which is removing what we call white-listing, every customer is in sort of a proof-of-concept mode. And once we remove that, you should be able to see much more automated onboarding of customers to that platform. I think with regard to the use of consumption and consumption-based offerings we see that our cloud data services plus managed services from partners are really good opportunities for customers to get going with us in a consumption offering. I think we made our subscription type model available. We're seeing early interest that's very healthy, and we are working with a small group of customers on proof-of-concepts getting them on board and going from there. With regard to the streamlined pricing and packaging of our platforms, I think that's a big part of why product gross margins continue to be healthy, right? I think that customers are able to understand the value that we offer in a much more streamlined way than we historically used to. And so it's another support element for product gross margins helping our sales force establish value with customers. With regard to some of the shifts we see going on in the market, as I mentioned, we are participating with the hyperscaler cloud providers in new market opportunities and especially in the public sector market. We'll tell you more about it as those become real, but they expand our total addressable market opportunity in a way that we didn't before. Our Data Fabric strategy is creating value for our customers NetApp and our investors. Only NetApp has the strategy the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multi-cloud IT. All these integration with the leading public clouds and industry-leading technology for on-premises storage solutions gives us a sustainable competitive advantage. We'll continue our strong focus on operational discipline, which enables us to make the strategic investments in sales coverage, customer experience and hybrid multi-cloud solutions needed to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. We are seeing early signs of success by getting in front of more customers, which gives me confidence that our investments will pay off in future growth. Thank you all and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks Kris. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our Q2 FY'20 results reflect the strength of our business model and the value of our innovation. We delivered gross margin, operating margin and EPS all solidly above our guidance ranges. Despite the ongoing macro economic uncertainty and the potential for continuing unpredictability in enterprise purchasing behavior, the fundamentals of our business are strong. I've just come from two great events, NetApp Insight and Microsoft Ignite and the many conversations I had with customers, prospects and partners both underscore the power of our data fabric strategy to differentiate our solution and highlight our success in reaching new customers and buying centers to expand our market share. At this year's Insight user conference, it was clear that we are solving real pain points for customers as they grapple with the complexity of hybrid multicloud IT. I witnessed the tangible enthusiasm for how we are helping customers address these challenges by building their own data fabric with net app. I'm sure those of you who were able to join us felt that excitement. We saw an increase in overall attendance and for almost half of the customer attendees, this was their first Insight. The number of executive level customers was up 80% from last year and the number of customers with cloud responsibilities doubled. Hybrid multicloud is the reality of customer's IT environment and NetApp has the strategy, the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help them succeed. At Insight, we announced that we are revolutionizing the customer experience and simplifying the business of hybrid multicloud with NetApp Keystone. NetApp Keystone creates a consistent experience from public cloud to the data center helping customers transform IT to operate with cloud like ease and flexibility everywhere. First, for customers who want truly elastic scaling without having to manage infrastructure, they can consume NetApp technology as a cloud service through the world's biggest public clouds. Second, for customers who want a cloud like experience on-premises, we offer subscription services and finally for customers who want to own and operate technology in their own data centers, we've introduced a radically simplified ownership experience for how our customers buy, optimize and grow with NetApp. Customers and partners choose NetApp because of our unique ability to offer a full range of capabilities needed to build their data fabric. NetApp Keystone compliments this with a consistent cloud like customer experience across the public cloud and on-premises. Let me be clear. Our approach to cloud is giving us access to new buyers and workloads as well as increasing the relevance of NetApp to companies both large and small. Cloud gives us both opportunity in the public cloud and makes us more attractive for on-premises deployments. While I'm heartened by the enthusiasm generated by our hybrid cloud data services, the headwinds we identified a last quarter's call persisted through Q2. Both macro economic and enterprise spending indicators show continued weakness. While we cannot predict when conditions will improve, we are planning our business assuming no change in these external factors for the foreseeable future. I'm pleased with our sales discipline and the ability to capture value in this tough market. To that point, our product gross margins demonstrate that we were able to maintain pricing discipline despite the soft environment. Regardless of what is happening in the broader macro environment, I remain confident that we can return to growth because of our ability to deliver real business value to customers hybrid multicloud environment. This increases our strategic relevance and enables us to reach new buyers through new pathways, address new workloads, and expand our presence with existing customers. To better capitalize on our opportunity and replicate our proven areas of success, we laid out a plan for you last quarter that includes increasing sales capacity by approximately 200 primary sales resources by the end of Q1 FY'21 without adding to the total operating expenses for the company. As of the end of Q2, we are well on track to deliver against this goal. The sales headcount will be deployed primarily in our America's geography. They bring capabilities to acquire new accounts as well as engage new buyers with new sources of funding like cloud architects and existing accounts. As a reminder, we expected to take roughly three to four quarters to bring these resources up to full productivity and the vast majority of the benefit of this additional capacity will be realized next year in fiscal year '21. We are also sharpening our attack on the key market transitions of this to flash, traditional IT architectures to private cloud and on-premises to public cloud. In Q2 our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services was up 29% sequentially to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.2 billion. We have industry leading guaranteed storage efficiency, the highest performance and the most complete cloud integration in the market today. In the quarter, Gartner published its Magic Quadrant for primary storage and NetApp took the highest ranking in the leader's quadrant for both our ability to execute and for the completeness of our vision. Moving to our private cloud solution. SolidFire, NetApp HCI and StorageGRID are the building blocks for private cloud deployments and enabling customers to bring public cloud like experience and economics into their data centers. Our private cloud business inclusive of products and services, a chained and annualized net revenue run rate of over $300 million in the second quarter up almost 30% year-over-year. Now onto cloud data services. Based on the last month of Q2, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to approximately $72 million up 167% year-over-year. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our cloud services and expect that our cloud services will continue to enable us to acquire new customers, reach new buyers, and expand the workload's managed at existing customers. Q2 is the first full quarter that Azure NetApp files has been generally available and we're making great progress. At Microsoft Ignite, I spoke to many customers who are planning to move a broad range of enterprise workloads like Oracle and SAP into the Azure cloud with Azure NetApp files. Customers love that they get the widest choice of file protocols and on-premises class performance and availability within Azure consistent experience from procurement to support to billing. A global energy company that's migrating high-performance workloads into the cloud for flexibility, scalability, global access and collaboration presented at Ignite about their experience with Azure NetApp files. The performance improvements they achieved are outstanding, simulation run times were reduced from months to days and in some cases hours. To quote the customer 'Azure NetApp file is a lifesaver' and that's just one example of the excitement we hearing from customers about what we're doing in the cloud. Our cloud volume services available in all three leading hyperscalers and gives us access to new opportunities from non-enterprise customers where our traditional solutions do not economically reach to new strategic buying centers in the world's largest enterprises where we are only a small part of their infrastructure, we are expanding addressable market with our cloud data services. Our many years of work and deep integration with the leading public clouds give us a sustainable competitive advantage in the hybrid multicloud. We're delivering an enormous amount of value to a growing number of customers, operating and planning to operate in a hybrid multicloud world. We're adding new customers each day. We're adding new use cases each week and we're adding new cloud regions each month to deliver the world's best hybrid cloud data services. As I've said before, customers and partners are choosing NetApp because of our data fabric strategy and our unique relationship with the hyperscale cloud providers. Our cloud data services not only give us access to customers and workloads that work heretofore inaccessible with our traditional solutions. They improve our competitive position for on-premises opportunities. Only Net app has the strategy, innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multicloud IT. We've made a lot of progress in delivering on our data fabric strategy. Our on-premises solutions are highly differentiated as evidenced by a strong product gross margin. We are now available in the three leading clouds. We have delivered both the technology and the customer experience needed for success in the hybrid multicloud and we are improving our execution and adding demand generation resources to drive new sales motion, but it is early days and we have more work to do to communicate the full scope of our capabilities as we saw it inside in Ignite, our story resonates with customers, because of this, I am confident in our ability to return to growth. We will continue to return capital to shareholders while investing for the long-term health of the business and capitalizing on our unique ability to help customers navigate the complexities of the hybrid multicloud. Before closing, I want to share some news about our organization. Henri Richard, Executive Vice President for Worldwide Customer and Field Operations has left me know of his intent to retire at the end of the fiscal year. Over the past 3.5 years at NetApp, Henri has done much to transform and modernize our sales force to take advantage of the strength of our data fabric strategy and our technology leadership as we pivoted to new buying centers and the growth areas of the market. Henri will participate in the search for his replacement and help in a seamless transition while continuing to lead the field and improving our execution. At the same time, I'm excited to announce the promotion of James Whitemore to Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. James came to NetApp in the SolidFire acquisition where he was CMO and has since been leading our demand generation and digital strategy in the marketing organization. As acting CMO, James has already made a strong impact and I'm glad to have him as the CMO of NetApp. With that, I'll turn it over to Ron for more details on the quarter and our expectations. Ron?\nRon Pasek: Thanks, George. Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, in Q2, we delivered strong margins and operating leverage in the face of continued caution from our customers as a result of the macro environment. Despite the demand uncertainty, we are confident in our product leadership and strategy to reaccelerate growth going forward. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and our healthy quarterly dividends. Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q2 performance. In Q2 net revenues of $1.371 billion were down 10% year-over-year, including 1 point of currency headwind. We had zero ELA revenue in the quarter compared to roughly 20 million of ELA revenue in Q2 '19, product revenue of $771 million decreased approximately 16% year-over-year. Adjusting for ELAs, Q2 total revenue would've been down approximately 8% and product revenues would have been down approximately 14%. Moving down the P&L, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $540 million was flat year-over-year. Deferred revenue increased 8% year-over-year in Q2. Gross margin of 68.6% was above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 57.3%, which is an increase of 3.2 points year-over-year and above our long-term target of 56% outlined at our Analyst Day. The improvement was driven by continued sales force discipline and increase in all-flash product mix and cost reductions and includes nearly a 0.5 of currency headwinds. Q2 was the 11th straight quarter, we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services, gross margin, 83% increased by over 150 basis points year-over-year driven by continued productivity improvements. Q2 operating expenses of $631 billion were down 3% year-over-year driven primarily by a reduction in variable compensation. Operating margin was 22.5% solidly above the high-end of our guidance range. Despite the revenue headwinds, EPS of a $1.09 was up 3% year-over-year and above the high-end of our guidance demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model. We closed Q2 with $3 billion in cash in short-term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative four days up 15 days, year-over-year. DSO of 52 days was up six days, year-over-year due to linearity in the quarter and to a lesser extent customer mix. DIO was 23 days, a nine day increase year-over-year. We continued to expect our cash conversion cycle to remain negative throughout fiscal 2020. Cash flow from operations was a negative $53 million, while free cash flow was a negative $89 million. The negative Q2 cashflow metrics are due to timing and do not reflect a change in our underlying business. The timing issues were primarily the accounts receivable. Additionally, there is a shift in the linearity of cash tax payments in FY'20. We are maintaining our expectations for free cashflow to be in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues in fiscal 2020. During Q2, we repurchased 9.8 million shares at an average price of $51.19 for a total of $500 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 236 million down 28 million shares year-on-year representing an 11% decrease. During the quarter, we paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $611 million to shareholders in the quarter. Our fiscal Q3 cash dividend will be $0.48 per share. Now onto guidance. We expect revenues for fiscal 2020 to be down approximately 8% year-over-year. We continue to expect ELAs to represent approximately 2% of total revenue. For fiscal 2020, we now expect gross margin to be in the range of 67% to 68% above our previous guidance of 66% to 67% due primarily to the improvement in product margin. Operating margin for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22% Implied in this guidance, is our expectation that operating expenses will be down slightly year-over-year in fiscal 2020 due to lower variable compensation. As a result of the updated revenue and margin guidance, we expect EPS to be down between 5% and 8% year-over-year without the benefit of buybacks. Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.39 billion and $1.54 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 6% decline in revenues year-over-year, including a 0.5 of currency headwind. For Q3, we expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to be approximately 22%. We expect earnings per share for the quarter to range between $1.14 and $1.22 per share. We are diligently focused on improved execution and addressing the challenges we face. We are committed to returning the company to growth and we remain confident, our business model leverage will enable us to deliver long-term shareholder returns. With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Ron. We will now open the call for Q&A. We ask that you'd be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Your product gross margins is north of 57% have been very strong, we have not seen that in a while actually since 2015. Can you talk about how much of that product gross margin was product mix driven versus commodity price tailwinds or maybe even federal mix? And do you feel that you can sustain or expand these margins as you go into the back half of the year?\nRon Pasek: Yes, Wamsi. Good question. On a year-over-year basis, most of it was mixed meaning we saw a higher percent this quarter of all-flash that we did say last quarter. Some of that was also cost reduction, not just on other things as well. That was in the face of having ELAs in the quarter. That goes against you. I did contemplate the ability to keep this level of gross margin through the rest of fiscal year and you saw that in the increase of the total margin guide.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, great. Thanks. And if I could really quickly on CDS, you exited last quarter with 5 million in monthly sales, seems like you exited this quarter with about 6 million despite Azure [indiscernible] quarter. Can you talk about, what are some of the challenges and not ramping this faster and I know George you expressed a lot of enthusiasm and all of your discussions with that Insight that big night? So, where do you expect CDS annualized revenue run rate could be as you exit fiscal '20. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We aren't going to give you guidance on the CDS business. I think as we said, we've taken longer than we originally expected to get to general availability given the technical sophistication of what we are offering to customers. The total addressable market is there. We are seeing a lot of demand and interest from customers and we're adding customers and growing footprints on a daily basis. We are going to just need to keep doing the work necessary to scale and enable all of the pathways associated with being able to take the solution to market and to replicate the wins that we've got across a broad range of workloads into more customers. So, we're focused on execution at this point.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.\nRod Hall: Yes. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to just check and see Ron, if you could comment on the accounts receivable and while the DSOs, the far highest we've seen, I think ever in our models. So just, I heard you say the tail end of the -- it was heavily back end loaded in the quarter, but any more color on that? And then the ELAs you're holding this 2% guide yet, there are no ELA so far. So just anything you can say that would help us all have more confidence that you've got visibility into that or are you still having to run on a treadmill to get them deals? Just kind of help us understand, why you still have confidence in that ELA guide. Thanks.\nRonPasek: So, with respect to AR, it was linearity within the quarter and particularly within the month. And then to a lesser extent some of the mix of customers we saw that bought in the last two months of the quarter. You saw a similar phenomenon in Q4 where we added a pretty back end loaded. And of course, collected all of that AR in Q1, which yielded a bunch of cashflow. It happens sometimes. The other issue with free cashflow and cashflow, which I mentioned in my script was larger cash tax payments. But I did reiterate the full year guidance 19% to 21% for free cash flow as a percent of revenue. With respect to ELAs, I'll make a comment and let George comment as well. Last year, this quarter we ended up giving you a full year guide of roughly 2% of revenue, we've to understand that we can't easily contemplate when those ELAs come in within each quarter. But for the full year we felt comfortable with that. We did that based on extensive conversations with parts of the sales force, making sure they understood the importance of this and the fact that it has a huge impact on earnings because it's essentially pure profit. So, that was the further conversation this quarter and it led to the continued commitment for the second half.\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to ELAs, Rod, I think the fundamental thing that we are doing with them is to enable streamlined customer purchasing. It doesn't require them to spend the whole amount of the ELA upfront. It's really to make their overall multiyear procurement agreements with us a lot more streamlined and to enable us to get a broader strategic footprint in the account. We know these accounts, some of them have intending events that this would clearly enable things to get more streamlined. And so, we're working in, right? We have visibility into these accounts. We know who these accounts are and we're working hard to bring this forward.\nRod Hall: Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Rod. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackermann with Cowen.\nKarl Ackermann: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for letting me ask question. Towards Ron, if I may going back to your outlook for December, it seems you are employing a not all-flash rate business will decline about 6% sequentially. That seems to be about in line with the seasonal averages of near line drives, but at the same time to have your hard drive suppliers have spoken about improved nearline shipments in December and for the first half of 2020 you know, when you also launched two new mid-range hybrid range at Insight. So, I don't know competitive forces impeding your ability to do a bit better in hybrid raise for the next few quarters or is he just conservative too? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: So, I'm not really sure I understand your question. We guiding total revenue. We're not even specific product revenue and within that, not all-flash. So, I'm not sure, I quite understand where you're going with that. But we feel good about our position in the hybrid array market. We are without question across a range of customer and analyst surveys, the best hybrid array vendor. We've introduced two new models. I think what we are framing up for the next quarter guide is really an overall product number. We're not forecasting it to the level of specific product components at this point.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Karl. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. George, I want to go back to the topic of installed base. In the past you've talked about installed base that is only penetrated in the teens. So how do you see, especially in the context of a strong AFA results for the October quarter? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We are up a few percentage points. We're up at 22% of the installed base now being on AFA. As we've said before, our installed base is growing and so while we ship a lot of new systems each quarter, the size and scope of the installed base and its growth leaves the total AFA penetration at a small number which allows us to have opportunity to continue to refresh over time the rest of the installed base.\nMehdi Hosseini: Sure. Thank you. Just one clarification, if I may. Would end of life support for ONTAP 7 actually help, expedite or increase the penetration rate?\nGeorge Kurian: Some of those customers that have not upgraded so far, there is a small number. But certainly, some of those if they look at the economics today of a platform like our C190, they would choose to go all-flash than go to a 10K disk-based system, because the economics are already better with our solutions to replace 10K drives.\nMehdi Hosseini: Great. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mehdi. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I'm just kind of want to understand a little bit on the guidance side. It would appear based on the gross margin guidance in the current quarter that you're not obviously factoring in ELA. I think last time, it's like a 400-basis point benefit that you saw in product gross margin. So, if that's true, and we kind of think about the setup going into the April quarter, it's kind of hit the full-year guidance level. Number one are you factoring in a revenue contribution to kind of hit an absolute increase in revenue in the April quarter that includes an ELA and therefore we should also be thinking that the gross margin into that April quarter is significantly higher, just because that ELA contribution would fall into that, if you kind of hit that 2% of total revenue for the full year or is that just not factored into your guidance at all. I'm trying to understand how you kind of think about the mechanics of the implied guidance at the April quarter?\nRon Pasek: Yes. So, remember, as we go through the fiscal year this for Q3 and Q4, product revenue becomes a larger part of the total, which overall is dilutive to overall margin, right? So, you can't just look at the numbers that you're holding total margin flat to Q3 therefore, you don't have an ELA, because of mix of product versus services is higher in Q3 obviously. So, there is some ELA in Q3 and there are absolutely some in Q4.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And on an absolute basis, April quarter versus what you've done over the past few years. I think early '18 the storage market was fairly healthy. So, I'm just trying -- you have a line of sight that says, look on the absolute sequential basis, you can kind of, see that kind of jump that you saw back in 2018 or is there something else that I'm just not thinking about in the model?\nRon Pasek: Well, again, you've got the benefit of ELAs in Q3 and Q4 which you didn't have essentially last year Q3, Q4 to a great extent. That helps in all the things meaningful.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Aaron. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. EMEA was stronger than other segments. Can you talk about whether that was your own execution, or did you see some improvement in the market and then just generally speaking, can you comment on the spending environment relative to the caution that you highlighted in the first quarter in the major segments? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: We saw Q2 relatively unchanged from Q1. And as we said at the start of the year, Q1 was a step down from calendar Q1 which was our fiscal Q4 of last year, but there were no major changes overall in terms of the trajectory from Q1 in terms of spending. Customers continue to be cautious. They are scrutinizing transactions. They're buying for what they need today and the differentiation for offerings is clearly visible in the fact that our gross margins were really, really strong. With regard to EMEA, our teams have done a really good job and I want to salute our sales teams, there is a lot of execution that has been a big part of our strength in EMEA.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Katy. Next question.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Cabral: Thank you. The services business was down a touch if you put together both hardware and software. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are in addressing some of the renewal issues that you highlighted on prior calls and just how we should think about a return to growth for services going forward?\nRon Pasek: So, we've made some progress. You can see that we're essentially flat when you adjust for FX. We still have some work to do. There is some organizational work we're doing. There is some process work we're doing. You can't see that yet manifested itself in growth, but as George indicated the installed base is growing and we believe that eventually we will get back to growth as well. And you can see that in the deferred revenue number. So, it's not going backwards, which is good as it did in Q4 of last year, but we still have some work to do.\nMatt Cabral: Got it. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Matt. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAlex Kurtz: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. George on the last call, it seems like the sales force productivity issue was really the main driver to the reset, and I'm sure we touched on macro in that call, but it just seemed like that was really the focus from the team. So then fast forward 90 days and you seem very optimistic about the hiring of the new reps and I just wonder what gives you the confidence, 90 days later, because it seemed like it was a pretty big step back internally as far as how the team is working, but maybe we were overestimating that and maybe things were as difficult to kind of fix as far as hiring productive reps and ramping them?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, what we said on the Q1 call was that the quarterly results reflected two-thirds macro, one-thirds sales execution. And so, it was a reflection of the macro in the purchasing behavior of our largest customers that drove the majority of the impact in Q1. We've always believed that our portfolio is really strong and given our position in the market, we have ample room to capture more accounts and to invest some of the really strong gross margin leverage that we're seeing into investment in field sales coverage. We've always believed, our story is differentiated in the market. We're doing exciting things and we are an attractive place to work. So, we've been pleasantly surprised with our ability to hire good quality salespeople and we're focused on getting them productive and ramping them. I think I would just say we are heads down and focused on execution. Q2 saw an improvement relative to Q1 in terms of our ability to execute and capture the deals in front of us. We got to keep doing that. And I expect us to continue to do that through the course of the year.\nAlex Kurtz: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Alex. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess, Ron, you're taking up gross margins fairly notably for fiscal '20. Structurally, I'm wondering, do you think 67% plus gross margin that's something that's sustainable long-term? Or was there some specific benefits of it maybe more one-time in nature in fiscal '20 versus longer term? How do we just think about the levers that are enabling this upside? And then George, how do you think about Dell's upcoming mid-range solution and what that could do from a pricing or competitive basis for you guys?\nRon Pasek: So, Amit, I think if you look at where we are in the quarter and then implied in some of the guide for the rest of the year, we are at the model we articulated at our Analyst Day for product margins 1.5 year ago. So, we said 55% at that point after the 606 change, I said 56% to 57%. And so, yes, I believe it's completely sustainable. It's a good 10 points below one of our competitors who is an all-flash competitor. It's 10 points above where we were two years ago so it's a really good place to be and it gives us a lot of flexibility to still be aggressive, but not under earn.\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to your comment about Dell EMC, we feel very good about our solution set. We are seen by Gartner and customers as the leader for Primary Storage and we are the only vendor in the market with a comprehensive cloud strategy. And so, we feel good about our position in the market and we are going to capitalize on it, which is why we are investing in sales capacity to go capture net new accounts and expand wallet share within existing accounts.\nAmit Daryanani: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks Amit. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Vadheim with Wolfe Research.\nAndrew Vadheim: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on a prior question and how it relates to guidance. So, you mentioned the weakness you're seeing and sort of deteriorating macroeconomic environment, but I'm just wondering why you decided then tightened the full-year guide especially on revenue kind of taking it from a 5-point range to 1-point estimate?\nRon Pasek: I think when you think about the guide, we have two quarters of actuals and guiding Q3 discreetly. So, you essentially have three of the four quarters. I think it would be strange to keep the same 5% to 10% down when in fact we kind of know where we think we'll be in Q4. Remember Q4 last year is a relatively easy compare, we were down 3%. So, getting to that number should not be that difficult whereas the first half of this year was much more difficult compare. Couple that with effect that we have ELAs in the second half, we didn't have in the first half just felt like it was a better thing to do.\nAndrew Vadheim: Okay, thanks. And then separately, public sector was kind of down sequentially. Just was wondering to what extent that was expected and should we think of public sector sort of being in line with the rest of the company on a year-over-year growth basis and sort of Q3 and 4Q?\nGeorge Kurian: You know over the last year or two, we started to shift the mix of our public sector business to be more program-related and broaden the book of business beyond just the fed to state, local and higher education and other parts of the market. As a result, you will see the business trend toward more of a standard pattern as opposed to a big step up in Q2.\nAndrew Vadheim: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Andrew. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks. I wanted to see if we could touch a little bit on what you're seeing in the macro environment given what we've heard from others reporting tonight. It sounds to me that maybe you saw some of the deterioration of enterprise demand a little bit earlier. And so, this is more of an issue of timing. And what I'm really looking for from you is, how the demand has maybe evolved or changed over the course of the quarter versus what you talked about in August. Is the weakness shifting among verticals, steady, how is it changed? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think in aggregate, we did not see a material change in Q2 from what we saw in Q1. With regard to the exposure of specific verticals and so on, we have a broad book of business. We wouldn't say that we are exposed to any particular vertical to be able to comment specifically about it. I would say it's reflective of the news that you see in the market, right? And there are teams in countries like Germany where the spending pattern is tight, who are executing really, really well for us. And we did see some slowdowns in other parts of the world, but nothing that's unique to NetApp. And our view is, Q2 is reflective of a more stable long-term pattern that we see in the market and it is a materially changed from Q1 and that's what we're planning our business around. To capture the value from our differentiated offerings by being disciplined on price and extracting the value that we feel we deserve, and then investing some of that benefit from gross margin and operating margin leverage into the quarter bearing sales capacity that we talked about last time. And we feel that the combination of the two should allow us to bring -- get our business back to growth over time and continue to deliver the earnings model and returns to shareholders that we've committed to.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks. Just to clarify one thing. Did you see seasonal strength in the federal vertical in the most recent quarter that sets up a tougher sequential comp in the January quarter, is that material for you? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Our book of business in the public sector market is increasingly broad. We have diversified our book of business to be deployable in program spending, which is not driven by any specific seasonality pattern. We are growing our footprint in state and local governments, so the public sector business had its normal year end pattern, but the Fed business is a smaller component of our overall public sector business.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the questions.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Simon. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. George, you continue to be pretty bullish on adding new customers, especially with your cloud offerings. Can you give us a sense of whether that's share displacement there, primarily new workloads and is that transitioning over to some traditional storage sales as well?\nGeorge Kurian: We are certainly seeing a broad range of workloads being deployed on our cloud solutions, ecommerce, databases like Oracle and SAP HANA which are high-performance transactional workloads. We see genetics and bio science applications, vertical applications for oil and gas and healthcare. So, really broad set of applications that require consistent performance and high-availability. And I think that's what we are uniquely positioned in the cloud for. There are customers and many that are saying that, listen, if you're going to use you in the cloud, we want to harmonize our on-premises environment, so that we can move workloads between the two landscapes. And with our announcement of Keystone, a subscription service for on-premises environments, we can now have not only the technology that allows them to standardize workload models between on-prem and public cloud, but the customer experience and the consumption offering that allows them to do that.\nGeorge Iwanyc: All right. And just expanding on your Keystone comments. How long do you think the selling motion will take to get that up and running?\nGeorge Kurian: I think that, listen, we don't believe that Keystone subscription services will replace CapEx purchasing, right? We think it will be a part of what customers want for their IT landscape. We are doing the work to enable our sales teams to be able to position that offering in the right way into customers and we think it will take time. We'll give you updates as we go. With regard to our business model, we hold the assets on our books. You see depreciation, similar to what were in the P&L we have, we report cloud data services depreciation, right? So, it's not going to be material this year.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, George. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva: Thanks very much. And George, you've been very vocal about hiring more sales. And can you just remind us of the cadence, is it kind of higher during six months trained relationships, we're growing in six-month after. So, we're kind of looking at fiscal kind of '21 or kind of summer of next year always said the fruit really starts to bear from these efforts. Is that the right timeline or I might be off on that?\nGeorge Kurian: Just to go back to what we said. We said that we were going to hire 200 incremental demand generation headcount over four quarters with the last quarter being Q1 of fiscal '21 and we are on track. It takes three to four quarters to train a rep and to get them to full productivity. So, we think that the predominant benefit of this additional capacity will be in fiscal '21.\nJim Suva: Great. Thank you so much for the clarification. It's greatly appreciated.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Jim. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital.\nLou Miscioscia: Okay. Thank you. So, two questions sort of combined together. One of the things about the sales force, you said a good portion of the sales force wasn't selling the entire product line, given obviously the relationships they have there. I assume this is just more of a reeducation and maybe some adjusting to the sales plan. I'm just wondering, how is that actually happening? How is it going? And then, combined with that maybe this is part of it obviously flash improved significantly on a quarter-to-quarter basis, just you went through some of the impacts last quarter, but how did you get flash bouncing back so quickly this quarter?\nGeorge Kurian: I want to credit the field organization for focus and execution, right? I think we said that what we were going to do was to focus on the big market transitions just to flash, traditional IT to public private cloud and the deployment of enterprise workloads in public clouds sort of the key areas where we would attack the market and I think credit to the sales leadership and the sales force for the progress in all-flash. With regard to the comments you made earlier about our ability to sell the full portfolio, what we observe is that there are different buyers for some of our portfolio than the traditional storage buyer. Cloud architects, DevOps, staff and workload owners like application owners, we have been focused on reaching them and bringing them to our user conference, we saw a substantial uplift in the number of people from those pedigrees coming to our user conference, reflecting both the success of our field and marketing teams and reaching them over time, as well as the interest that we have in our portfolio, right? So, we need specific competency to go after those types of sales motions and we're bringing that into the company as part of our 200 headcount. And of course, we're focused on training the storage focused sales force on expanding their relevance to some of these new audiences. So, work is under way as I said we're heads down in executing against these three imperatives. We saw the benefit of that focus in Q2 and we're going to continue to stay laser focused on that through the rest of the year.\nLou Miscioscia: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Lou. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.\nAnanda Baruah: Hi. Thanks guys for taking the questions. Ron, George. George, at your last Analyst Day, you guys talked about mid-single digit revenue growth. Now that you're getting the sales force, sort of call it reoptimized, I mean maybe reoptimized to think from the adding. Does the optimization process put you in the position longer term to give stronger revenue growth, if your marketplace optimize? And then just real quick Ron, I believe you had some ELA expectation in the results for the quarter. So, and you basically did in revenues. So, do you outperform your internal product revenue targets for the quarter? Thanks guys. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: So, I think that we have many avenues to grow our business. We have a leading position in Primary Storage on-premises. We have a growing private cloud business and we are the only storage vendor who can support enterprise workloads in all of the major public clouds. And so, I feel like we have plenty of total addressable market. We are focused on getting the company back on track to growth, right? And we'll tell you more about our long-term earnings model the next time we hold an Analyst Day. I will just tell you that we have delivered on all of the elements of commitments we made in terms of gross margins and operating margins and so on and barring the slowdown in enterprise spending this year, we were on track to meet even the top-line numbers that we had committed. So, we feel strongly about delivering on our commitments. Right now we are entirely focused on executing against the opportunities in front of us and getting the company back to growth and digital sales headcount funded by the strong margin profile of our business is the first step, getting them on board productive and all of that's the focus of the company right now. Ron?\nRon Pasek: And Ananda, you're right. I did and mention in the Q2 guide, we had factored in some amount of ELA which of course did not come through. And it was essentially the entire miss to the midpoint. It simply flaps into Q3. So yes, we've had sector where we thought with the exception that one ELA.\nAnanda Baruah: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Ananda. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you. So, really nice net new cloud ARR within the quarter of $11 million, which compares to $7 million in the year ago quarter. So that's very strong net new ARR growth. Is that all -- as they are files driven or sales capacity driven or something else?\nGeorge Kurian: The majority of our growth in cloud data services is from Microsoft Azure NetApp Files. We saw -- and the majority of that revenue is from net new customers, right? So, we don't have a single large customer that's a big percentage of the total number. We are seeing good momentum across a broad range of use cases and a broad range of customers trying things out and deploying their first workloads. So, as we go forward, we are focused both on continuing to acquire new customers, but additionally to expand our footprints now that we've got success in some of these customers to broader sets of workloads. So, thank you for that.\nNehal Chokshi: And if I may. My understanding is that you do have some specialists trying to sell cloud data services. Although, I believe also the broader sales force is also capable. So, in the cloud services. What's the sourcing of this new cloud ARR between these two sales forces?\nGeorge Kurian: It's hard for me to comment on that. I think we've got multiple pathways into the market. We've got both specialists and generalists within our field who are focused on selling cloud data services as part of their remits. And we have the Microsoft pathway into market, which we are continuing to work to enable around the use cases and the expanding number of use cases of our technology. So, it will take time, but we're heads down and focused on it. And we're really excited about how successful the technology is in serving the customers that have come on board, right? For things like databases and ecommerce and content management and media and life sciences and an incredibly wide range of applications, frankly more than I had expected. We have compelling business advantage that we offer customers.\nNehal Chokshi: Great. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Nehal. Next questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Todorov with Longbow Research.\nNick Todorov: Thank you. Apologize for the background noise. Service margins continue to tick up despite I think you guys are still investing a lot of the CDS business, which is a headwind, which should abate at some point. Ron, can you comment about the runway, or how do you see the opportunity to continue to grow services margins over time?\nRon Pasek: It's something that we are focused on in the sense that we're trying to get more efficient. Having said that, I don't want to be too much more higher than where we are today. It's not something I contemplated in our long-term guide at our Analyst Day, it's much about what we saw in this quarter. So, I think there is good work being done, there is some more work we can do, but [Technical Difficulty] upside to that number.\nNick Todorov: Okay. And if I can just follow-up, at some point you in order to hit the fiscal year '21 guide for CDS, there needs to be a step function increase I guess on a quarter-over-quarter basis. I guess what are the -- what needs to -- what work needs to be done. Do you guys need Google also to go general availability to kind of start seeing really that inflection. So, investors can get more confident around that target exiting fiscal year '21? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: We started, we got to general availability later than we expected, given the complexity of integrating a really high-performance service so deeply into these hyperscale cloud. We are at GA with Microsoft. We have clear line of sight into GA with Google. And we think that there is a broad -- the total addressable markets there. As I said earlier, the number of use cases that are being deployed on our platform is broader than we originally anticipated. And so, we've got work to do to execute to train the sales force, to train the Microsoft channel, get our message out to market and bringing the customers to be able to deploy them on our platform. We saw a good start to that with the attendance at Microsoft Ignite and at NetApp Insight where the number of people coming to talk to us and starts to do proof of concepts with us, were really good. So, we've got heads down. We got to deliver on getting these customers successful, but we feel like we got a really, really good platform and the early results have been really good.\nNick Todorov: Thanks. Good luck, guys.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Nick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. Just one question from me. George, obviously you're not making any grand ambitions about the macro, so when you mentioned the return of growth, I assume for next fiscal year. Is it mainly driven by the sales force execution or how would you sort of rank and characterize what's most important in terms of getting back to top-line growth? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think it's really making sure that we can capture the full range of opportunities that are available in front of us. As I said, we have leadership positions in a broad range of categories of primary storage. We are the only vendor with the cloud strategy and really compelling technology available in the big public clouds, all of the big public clouds. And we need to be able to go and access the customers that are making those decisions which is where the sales headcount focus is really a critical part of the go forward plan. The differentiation of our technology is evident in product gross margins, right? And the leverage of our business model is evident in the results we just showed and the guidance we gave. And I think for us it's the macro is going to be the macro, we're going to go take share and to go after the addressable market. We are doing that prudently within the guidance of that we gave you and by prioritizing our resources against the biggest opportunities.\nSteven Fox: I appreciate that color. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Steven. Next question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. Could you talk about the contribution you saw in the quarter from your big distribution channel partners, several distributors and resellers have called out relative strength in the storage following your very weak June quarter. I mean is that a reflection of the middle markets being a little bit more stable or bouncing or any changes in your channel partner programs? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: The contribution of indirect channels to our business was relatively unchanged in terms of the overall mix of our business. It's approximately 80% each quarter, and we feel that that's well reflective of our overall book of business, nothing unusual there. You are correct that the mid-market is relatively less concerned about the impact of the global economic slowdown and some of the uncertainty there. And we have more opportunities to capture share because our share in the mid-market is a bit smaller than it is in the enterprise. Our channel partners were focused on enabling focused set of channel partners, so that they get the full impact of NetApp's enablement resources and so we've got a narrow group that we work with, and we're pleased with the progress so far.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Matt. I'll pass it back to George for some final comments.\nGeorge Kurian: Before we close, I want to underscore a few key points. NetApp is helping customers deliver enormous business value in both traditional IT-led and increasingly in cloud-led use cases. Only NetApp has the strategy, the broad innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multicloud IT. We believe we can return to growth over time by selling the value of our differentiated portfolio and investing in additional sales capacity to reach new buyers. As I saw at Insight and Ignite, we are making real progress here. We continue to be disciplined in our spending and have a strong financial model with growing gross margins and operating margins that enable us to return cash to shareholders and invest in the long-term health of our business. Thank you. And I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ron Pasek",
            "content": "Thanks, George. Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, in Q2, we delivered strong margins and operating leverage in the face of continued caution from our customers as a result of the macro environment. Despite the demand uncertainty, we are confident in our product leadership and strategy to reaccelerate growth going forward. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and our healthy quarterly dividends. Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q2 performance. In Q2 net revenues of $1.371 billion were down 10% year-over-year, including 1 point of currency headwind. We had zero ELA revenue in the quarter compared to roughly 20 million of ELA revenue in Q2 '19, product revenue of $771 million decreased approximately 16% year-over-year. Adjusting for ELAs, Q2 total revenue would've been down approximately 8% and product revenues would have been down approximately 14%. Moving down the P&L, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $540 million was flat year-over-year. Deferred revenue increased 8% year-over-year in Q2. Gross margin of 68.6% was above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 57.3%, which is an increase of 3.2 points year-over-year and above our long-term target of 56% outlined at our Analyst Day. The improvement was driven by continued sales force discipline and increase in all-flash product mix and cost reductions and includes nearly a 0.5 of currency headwinds. Q2 was the 11th straight quarter, we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services, gross margin, 83% increased by over 150 basis points year-over-year driven by continued productivity improvements. Q2 operating expenses of $631 billion were down 3% year-over-year driven primarily by a reduction in variable compensation. Operating margin was 22.5% solidly above the high-end of our guidance range. Despite the revenue headwinds, EPS of a $1.09 was up 3% year-over-year and above the high-end of our guidance demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model. We closed Q2 with $3 billion in cash in short-term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative four days up 15 days, year-over-year. DSO of 52 days was up six days, year-over-year due to linearity in the quarter and to a lesser extent customer mix. DIO was 23 days, a nine day increase year-over-year. We continued to expect our cash conversion cycle to remain negative throughout fiscal 2020. Cash flow from operations was a negative $53 million, while free cash flow was a negative $89 million. The negative Q2 cashflow metrics are due to timing and do not reflect a change in our underlying business. The timing issues were primarily the accounts receivable. Additionally, there is a shift in the linearity of cash tax payments in FY'20. We are maintaining our expectations for free cashflow to be in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues in fiscal 2020. During Q2, we repurchased 9.8 million shares at an average price of $51.19 for a total of $500 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 236 million down 28 million shares year-on-year representing an 11% decrease. During the quarter, we paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $611 million to shareholders in the quarter. Our fiscal Q3 cash dividend will be $0.48 per share. Now onto guidance. We expect revenues for fiscal 2020 to be down approximately 8% year-over-year. We continue to expect ELAs to represent approximately 2% of total revenue. For fiscal 2020, we now expect gross margin to be in the range of 67% to 68% above our previous guidance of 66% to 67% due primarily to the improvement in product margin. Operating margin for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22% Implied in this guidance, is our expectation that operating expenses will be down slightly year-over-year in fiscal 2020 due to lower variable compensation. As a result of the updated revenue and margin guidance, we expect EPS to be down between 5% and 8% year-over-year without the benefit of buybacks. Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.39 billion and $1.54 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 6% decline in revenues year-over-year, including a 0.5 of currency headwind. For Q3, we expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to be approximately 22%. We expect earnings per share for the quarter to range between $1.14 and $1.22 per share. We are diligently focused on improved execution and addressing the challenges we face. We are committed to returning the company to growth and we remain confident, our business model leverage will enable us to deliver long-term shareholder returns. With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Yes, Wamsi. Good question. On a year-over-year basis, most of it was mixed meaning we saw a higher percent this quarter of all-flash that we did say last quarter. Some of that was also cost reduction, not just on other things as well. That was in the face of having ELAs in the quarter. That goes against you. I did contemplate the ability to keep this level of gross margin through the rest of fiscal year and you saw that in the increase of the total margin guide. So, with respect to AR, it was linearity within the quarter and particularly within the month. And then to a lesser extent some of the mix of customers we saw that bought in the last two months of the quarter. You saw a similar phenomenon in Q4 where we added a pretty back end loaded. And of course, collected all of that AR in Q1, which yielded a bunch of cashflow. It happens sometimes. The other issue with free cashflow and cashflow, which I mentioned in my script was larger cash tax payments. But I did reiterate the full year guidance 19% to 21% for free cash flow as a percent of revenue. With respect to ELAs, I'll make a comment and let George comment as well. Last year, this quarter we ended up giving you a full year guide of roughly 2% of revenue, we've to understand that we can't easily contemplate when those ELAs come in within each quarter. But for the full year we felt comfortable with that. We did that based on extensive conversations with parts of the sales force, making sure they understood the importance of this and the fact that it has a huge impact on earnings because it's essentially pure profit. So, that was the further conversation this quarter and it led to the continued commitment for the second half. Yes. So, remember, as we go through the fiscal year this for Q3 and Q4, product revenue becomes a larger part of the total, which overall is dilutive to overall margin, right? So, you can't just look at the numbers that you're holding total margin flat to Q3 therefore, you don't have an ELA, because of mix of product versus services is higher in Q3 obviously. So, there is some ELA in Q3 and there are absolutely some in Q4. Well, again, you've got the benefit of ELAs in Q3 and Q4 which you didn't have essentially last year Q3, Q4 to a great extent. That helps in all the things meaningful. So, we've made some progress. You can see that we're essentially flat when you adjust for FX. We still have some work to do. There is some organizational work we're doing. There is some process work we're doing. You can't see that yet manifested itself in growth, but as George indicated the installed base is growing and we believe that eventually we will get back to growth as well. And you can see that in the deferred revenue number. So, it's not going backwards, which is good as it did in Q4 of last year, but we still have some work to do. So, Amit, I think if you look at where we are in the quarter and then implied in some of the guide for the rest of the year, we are at the model we articulated at our Analyst Day for product margins 1.5 year ago. So, we said 55% at that point after the 606 change, I said 56% to 57%. And so, yes, I believe it's completely sustainable. It's a good 10 points below one of our competitors who is an all-flash competitor. It's 10 points above where we were two years ago so it's a really good place to be and it gives us a lot of flexibility to still be aggressive, but not under earn. I think when you think about the guide, we have two quarters of actuals and guiding Q3 discreetly. So, you essentially have three of the four quarters. I think it would be strange to keep the same 5% to 10% down when in fact we kind of know where we think we'll be in Q4. Remember Q4 last year is a relatively easy compare, we were down 3%. So, getting to that number should not be that difficult whereas the first half of this year was much more difficult compare. Couple that with effect that we have ELAs in the second half, we didn't have in the first half just felt like it was a better thing to do. And Ananda, you're right. I did and mention in the Q2 guide, we had factored in some amount of ELA which of course did not come through. And it was essentially the entire miss to the midpoint. It simply flaps into Q3. So yes, we've had sector where we thought with the exception that one ELA. It's something that we are focused on in the sense that we're trying to get more efficient. Having said that, I don't want to be too much more higher than where we are today. It's not something I contemplated in our long-term guide at our Analyst Day, it's much about what we saw in this quarter. So, I think there is good work being done, there is some more work we can do, but [Technical Difficulty] upside to that number."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks Kris. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our Q2 FY'20 results reflect the strength of our business model and the value of our innovation. We delivered gross margin, operating margin and EPS all solidly above our guidance ranges. Despite the ongoing macro economic uncertainty and the potential for continuing unpredictability in enterprise purchasing behavior, the fundamentals of our business are strong. I've just come from two great events, NetApp Insight and Microsoft Ignite and the many conversations I had with customers, prospects and partners both underscore the power of our data fabric strategy to differentiate our solution and highlight our success in reaching new customers and buying centers to expand our market share. At this year's Insight user conference, it was clear that we are solving real pain points for customers as they grapple with the complexity of hybrid multicloud IT. I witnessed the tangible enthusiasm for how we are helping customers address these challenges by building their own data fabric with net app. I'm sure those of you who were able to join us felt that excitement. We saw an increase in overall attendance and for almost half of the customer attendees, this was their first Insight. The number of executive level customers was up 80% from last year and the number of customers with cloud responsibilities doubled. Hybrid multicloud is the reality of customer's IT environment and NetApp has the strategy, the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help them succeed. At Insight, we announced that we are revolutionizing the customer experience and simplifying the business of hybrid multicloud with NetApp Keystone. NetApp Keystone creates a consistent experience from public cloud to the data center helping customers transform IT to operate with cloud like ease and flexibility everywhere. First, for customers who want truly elastic scaling without having to manage infrastructure, they can consume NetApp technology as a cloud service through the world's biggest public clouds. Second, for customers who want a cloud like experience on-premises, we offer subscription services and finally for customers who want to own and operate technology in their own data centers, we've introduced a radically simplified ownership experience for how our customers buy, optimize and grow with NetApp. Customers and partners choose NetApp because of our unique ability to offer a full range of capabilities needed to build their data fabric. NetApp Keystone compliments this with a consistent cloud like customer experience across the public cloud and on-premises. Let me be clear. Our approach to cloud is giving us access to new buyers and workloads as well as increasing the relevance of NetApp to companies both large and small. Cloud gives us both opportunity in the public cloud and makes us more attractive for on-premises deployments. While I'm heartened by the enthusiasm generated by our hybrid cloud data services, the headwinds we identified a last quarter's call persisted through Q2. Both macro economic and enterprise spending indicators show continued weakness. While we cannot predict when conditions will improve, we are planning our business assuming no change in these external factors for the foreseeable future. I'm pleased with our sales discipline and the ability to capture value in this tough market. To that point, our product gross margins demonstrate that we were able to maintain pricing discipline despite the soft environment. Regardless of what is happening in the broader macro environment, I remain confident that we can return to growth because of our ability to deliver real business value to customers hybrid multicloud environment. This increases our strategic relevance and enables us to reach new buyers through new pathways, address new workloads, and expand our presence with existing customers. To better capitalize on our opportunity and replicate our proven areas of success, we laid out a plan for you last quarter that includes increasing sales capacity by approximately 200 primary sales resources by the end of Q1 FY'21 without adding to the total operating expenses for the company. As of the end of Q2, we are well on track to deliver against this goal. The sales headcount will be deployed primarily in our America's geography. They bring capabilities to acquire new accounts as well as engage new buyers with new sources of funding like cloud architects and existing accounts. As a reminder, we expected to take roughly three to four quarters to bring these resources up to full productivity and the vast majority of the benefit of this additional capacity will be realized next year in fiscal year '21. We are also sharpening our attack on the key market transitions of this to flash, traditional IT architectures to private cloud and on-premises to public cloud. In Q2 our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services was up 29% sequentially to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.2 billion. We have industry leading guaranteed storage efficiency, the highest performance and the most complete cloud integration in the market today. In the quarter, Gartner published its Magic Quadrant for primary storage and NetApp took the highest ranking in the leader's quadrant for both our ability to execute and for the completeness of our vision. Moving to our private cloud solution. SolidFire, NetApp HCI and StorageGRID are the building blocks for private cloud deployments and enabling customers to bring public cloud like experience and economics into their data centers. Our private cloud business inclusive of products and services, a chained and annualized net revenue run rate of over $300 million in the second quarter up almost 30% year-over-year. Now onto cloud data services. Based on the last month of Q2, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to approximately $72 million up 167% year-over-year. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our cloud services and expect that our cloud services will continue to enable us to acquire new customers, reach new buyers, and expand the workload's managed at existing customers. Q2 is the first full quarter that Azure NetApp files has been generally available and we're making great progress. At Microsoft Ignite, I spoke to many customers who are planning to move a broad range of enterprise workloads like Oracle and SAP into the Azure cloud with Azure NetApp files. Customers love that they get the widest choice of file protocols and on-premises class performance and availability within Azure consistent experience from procurement to support to billing. A global energy company that's migrating high-performance workloads into the cloud for flexibility, scalability, global access and collaboration presented at Ignite about their experience with Azure NetApp files. The performance improvements they achieved are outstanding, simulation run times were reduced from months to days and in some cases hours. To quote the customer 'Azure NetApp file is a lifesaver' and that's just one example of the excitement we hearing from customers about what we're doing in the cloud. Our cloud volume services available in all three leading hyperscalers and gives us access to new opportunities from non-enterprise customers where our traditional solutions do not economically reach to new strategic buying centers in the world's largest enterprises where we are only a small part of their infrastructure, we are expanding addressable market with our cloud data services. Our many years of work and deep integration with the leading public clouds give us a sustainable competitive advantage in the hybrid multicloud. We're delivering an enormous amount of value to a growing number of customers, operating and planning to operate in a hybrid multicloud world. We're adding new customers each day. We're adding new use cases each week and we're adding new cloud regions each month to deliver the world's best hybrid cloud data services. As I've said before, customers and partners are choosing NetApp because of our data fabric strategy and our unique relationship with the hyperscale cloud providers. Our cloud data services not only give us access to customers and workloads that work heretofore inaccessible with our traditional solutions. They improve our competitive position for on-premises opportunities. Only Net app has the strategy, innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multicloud IT. We've made a lot of progress in delivering on our data fabric strategy. Our on-premises solutions are highly differentiated as evidenced by a strong product gross margin. We are now available in the three leading clouds. We have delivered both the technology and the customer experience needed for success in the hybrid multicloud and we are improving our execution and adding demand generation resources to drive new sales motion, but it is early days and we have more work to do to communicate the full scope of our capabilities as we saw it inside in Ignite, our story resonates with customers, because of this, I am confident in our ability to return to growth. We will continue to return capital to shareholders while investing for the long-term health of the business and capitalizing on our unique ability to help customers navigate the complexities of the hybrid multicloud. Before closing, I want to share some news about our organization. Henri Richard, Executive Vice President for Worldwide Customer and Field Operations has left me know of his intent to retire at the end of the fiscal year. Over the past 3.5 years at NetApp, Henri has done much to transform and modernize our sales force to take advantage of the strength of our data fabric strategy and our technology leadership as we pivoted to new buying centers and the growth areas of the market. Henri will participate in the search for his replacement and help in a seamless transition while continuing to lead the field and improving our execution. At the same time, I'm excited to announce the promotion of James Whitemore to Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. James came to NetApp in the SolidFire acquisition where he was CMO and has since been leading our demand generation and digital strategy in the marketing organization. As acting CMO, James has already made a strong impact and I'm glad to have him as the CMO of NetApp. With that, I'll turn it over to Ron for more details on the quarter and our expectations. Ron? We aren't going to give you guidance on the CDS business. I think as we said, we've taken longer than we originally expected to get to general availability given the technical sophistication of what we are offering to customers. The total addressable market is there. We are seeing a lot of demand and interest from customers and we're adding customers and growing footprints on a daily basis. We are going to just need to keep doing the work necessary to scale and enable all of the pathways associated with being able to take the solution to market and to replicate the wins that we've got across a broad range of workloads into more customers. So, we're focused on execution at this point. With regard to ELAs, Rod, I think the fundamental thing that we are doing with them is to enable streamlined customer purchasing. It doesn't require them to spend the whole amount of the ELA upfront. It's really to make their overall multiyear procurement agreements with us a lot more streamlined and to enable us to get a broader strategic footprint in the account. We know these accounts, some of them have intending events that this would clearly enable things to get more streamlined. And so, we're working in, right? We have visibility into these accounts. We know who these accounts are and we're working hard to bring this forward. So, I'm not really sure I understand your question. We guiding total revenue. We're not even specific product revenue and within that, not all-flash. So, I'm not sure, I quite understand where you're going with that. But we feel good about our position in the hybrid array market. We are without question across a range of customer and analyst surveys, the best hybrid array vendor. We've introduced two new models. I think what we are framing up for the next quarter guide is really an overall product number. We're not forecasting it to the level of specific product components at this point. We are up a few percentage points. We're up at 22% of the installed base now being on AFA. As we've said before, our installed base is growing and so while we ship a lot of new systems each quarter, the size and scope of the installed base and its growth leaves the total AFA penetration at a small number which allows us to have opportunity to continue to refresh over time the rest of the installed base. Some of those customers that have not upgraded so far, there is a small number. But certainly, some of those if they look at the economics today of a platform like our C190, they would choose to go all-flash than go to a 10K disk-based system, because the economics are already better with our solutions to replace 10K drives. We saw Q2 relatively unchanged from Q1. And as we said at the start of the year, Q1 was a step down from calendar Q1 which was our fiscal Q4 of last year, but there were no major changes overall in terms of the trajectory from Q1 in terms of spending. Customers continue to be cautious. They are scrutinizing transactions. They're buying for what they need today and the differentiation for offerings is clearly visible in the fact that our gross margins were really, really strong. With regard to EMEA, our teams have done a really good job and I want to salute our sales teams, there is a lot of execution that has been a big part of our strength in EMEA. Listen, what we said on the Q1 call was that the quarterly results reflected two-thirds macro, one-thirds sales execution. And so, it was a reflection of the macro in the purchasing behavior of our largest customers that drove the majority of the impact in Q1. We've always believed that our portfolio is really strong and given our position in the market, we have ample room to capture more accounts and to invest some of the really strong gross margin leverage that we're seeing into investment in field sales coverage. We've always believed, our story is differentiated in the market. We're doing exciting things and we are an attractive place to work. So, we've been pleasantly surprised with our ability to hire good quality salespeople and we're focused on getting them productive and ramping them. I think I would just say we are heads down and focused on execution. Q2 saw an improvement relative to Q1 in terms of our ability to execute and capture the deals in front of us. We got to keep doing that. And I expect us to continue to do that through the course of the year. With regard to your comment about Dell EMC, we feel very good about our solution set. We are seen by Gartner and customers as the leader for Primary Storage and we are the only vendor in the market with a comprehensive cloud strategy. And so, we feel good about our position in the market and we are going to capitalize on it, which is why we are investing in sales capacity to go capture net new accounts and expand wallet share within existing accounts. You know over the last year or two, we started to shift the mix of our public sector business to be more program-related and broaden the book of business beyond just the fed to state, local and higher education and other parts of the market. As a result, you will see the business trend toward more of a standard pattern as opposed to a big step up in Q2. I think in aggregate, we did not see a material change in Q2 from what we saw in Q1. With regard to the exposure of specific verticals and so on, we have a broad book of business. We wouldn't say that we are exposed to any particular vertical to be able to comment specifically about it. I would say it's reflective of the news that you see in the market, right? And there are teams in countries like Germany where the spending pattern is tight, who are executing really, really well for us. And we did see some slowdowns in other parts of the world, but nothing that's unique to NetApp. And our view is, Q2 is reflective of a more stable long-term pattern that we see in the market and it is a materially changed from Q1 and that's what we're planning our business around. To capture the value from our differentiated offerings by being disciplined on price and extracting the value that we feel we deserve, and then investing some of that benefit from gross margin and operating margin leverage into the quarter bearing sales capacity that we talked about last time. And we feel that the combination of the two should allow us to bring -- get our business back to growth over time and continue to deliver the earnings model and returns to shareholders that we've committed to. Our book of business in the public sector market is increasingly broad. We have diversified our book of business to be deployable in program spending, which is not driven by any specific seasonality pattern. We are growing our footprint in state and local governments, so the public sector business had its normal year end pattern, but the Fed business is a smaller component of our overall public sector business. We are certainly seeing a broad range of workloads being deployed on our cloud solutions, ecommerce, databases like Oracle and SAP HANA which are high-performance transactional workloads. We see genetics and bio science applications, vertical applications for oil and gas and healthcare. So, really broad set of applications that require consistent performance and high-availability. And I think that's what we are uniquely positioned in the cloud for. There are customers and many that are saying that, listen, if you're going to use you in the cloud, we want to harmonize our on-premises environment, so that we can move workloads between the two landscapes. And with our announcement of Keystone, a subscription service for on-premises environments, we can now have not only the technology that allows them to standardize workload models between on-prem and public cloud, but the customer experience and the consumption offering that allows them to do that. I think that, listen, we don't believe that Keystone subscription services will replace CapEx purchasing, right? We think it will be a part of what customers want for their IT landscape. We are doing the work to enable our sales teams to be able to position that offering in the right way into customers and we think it will take time. We'll give you updates as we go. With regard to our business model, we hold the assets on our books. You see depreciation, similar to what were in the P&L we have, we report cloud data services depreciation, right? So, it's not going to be material this year. Just to go back to what we said. We said that we were going to hire 200 incremental demand generation headcount over four quarters with the last quarter being Q1 of fiscal '21 and we are on track. It takes three to four quarters to train a rep and to get them to full productivity. So, we think that the predominant benefit of this additional capacity will be in fiscal '21. I want to credit the field organization for focus and execution, right? I think we said that what we were going to do was to focus on the big market transitions just to flash, traditional IT to public private cloud and the deployment of enterprise workloads in public clouds sort of the key areas where we would attack the market and I think credit to the sales leadership and the sales force for the progress in all-flash. With regard to the comments you made earlier about our ability to sell the full portfolio, what we observe is that there are different buyers for some of our portfolio than the traditional storage buyer. Cloud architects, DevOps, staff and workload owners like application owners, we have been focused on reaching them and bringing them to our user conference, we saw a substantial uplift in the number of people from those pedigrees coming to our user conference, reflecting both the success of our field and marketing teams and reaching them over time, as well as the interest that we have in our portfolio, right? So, we need specific competency to go after those types of sales motions and we're bringing that into the company as part of our 200 headcount. And of course, we're focused on training the storage focused sales force on expanding their relevance to some of these new audiences. So, work is under way as I said we're heads down in executing against these three imperatives. We saw the benefit of that focus in Q2 and we're going to continue to stay laser focused on that through the rest of the year. So, I think that we have many avenues to grow our business. We have a leading position in Primary Storage on-premises. We have a growing private cloud business and we are the only storage vendor who can support enterprise workloads in all of the major public clouds. And so, I feel like we have plenty of total addressable market. We are focused on getting the company back on track to growth, right? And we'll tell you more about our long-term earnings model the next time we hold an Analyst Day. I will just tell you that we have delivered on all of the elements of commitments we made in terms of gross margins and operating margins and so on and barring the slowdown in enterprise spending this year, we were on track to meet even the top-line numbers that we had committed. So, we feel strongly about delivering on our commitments. Right now we are entirely focused on executing against the opportunities in front of us and getting the company back to growth and digital sales headcount funded by the strong margin profile of our business is the first step, getting them on board productive and all of that's the focus of the company right now. Ron? The majority of our growth in cloud data services is from Microsoft Azure NetApp Files. We saw -- and the majority of that revenue is from net new customers, right? So, we don't have a single large customer that's a big percentage of the total number. We are seeing good momentum across a broad range of use cases and a broad range of customers trying things out and deploying their first workloads. So, as we go forward, we are focused both on continuing to acquire new customers, but additionally to expand our footprints now that we've got success in some of these customers to broader sets of workloads. So, thank you for that. It's hard for me to comment on that. I think we've got multiple pathways into the market. We've got both specialists and generalists within our field who are focused on selling cloud data services as part of their remits. And we have the Microsoft pathway into market, which we are continuing to work to enable around the use cases and the expanding number of use cases of our technology. So, it will take time, but we're heads down and focused on it. And we're really excited about how successful the technology is in serving the customers that have come on board, right? For things like databases and ecommerce and content management and media and life sciences and an incredibly wide range of applications, frankly more than I had expected. We have compelling business advantage that we offer customers. We started, we got to general availability later than we expected, given the complexity of integrating a really high-performance service so deeply into these hyperscale cloud. We are at GA with Microsoft. We have clear line of sight into GA with Google. And we think that there is a broad -- the total addressable markets there. As I said earlier, the number of use cases that are being deployed on our platform is broader than we originally anticipated. And so, we've got work to do to execute to train the sales force, to train the Microsoft channel, get our message out to market and bringing the customers to be able to deploy them on our platform. We saw a good start to that with the attendance at Microsoft Ignite and at NetApp Insight where the number of people coming to talk to us and starts to do proof of concepts with us, were really good. So, we've got heads down. We got to deliver on getting these customers successful, but we feel like we got a really, really good platform and the early results have been really good. I think it's really making sure that we can capture the full range of opportunities that are available in front of us. As I said, we have leadership positions in a broad range of categories of primary storage. We are the only vendor with the cloud strategy and really compelling technology available in the big public clouds, all of the big public clouds. And we need to be able to go and access the customers that are making those decisions which is where the sales headcount focus is really a critical part of the go forward plan. The differentiation of our technology is evident in product gross margins, right? And the leverage of our business model is evident in the results we just showed and the guidance we gave. And I think for us it's the macro is going to be the macro, we're going to go take share and to go after the addressable market. We are doing that prudently within the guidance of that we gave you and by prioritizing our resources against the biggest opportunities. The contribution of indirect channels to our business was relatively unchanged in terms of the overall mix of our business. It's approximately 80% each quarter, and we feel that that's well reflective of our overall book of business, nothing unusual there. You are correct that the mid-market is relatively less concerned about the impact of the global economic slowdown and some of the uncertainty there. And we have more opportunities to capture share because our share in the mid-market is a bit smaller than it is in the enterprise. Our channel partners were focused on enabling focused set of channel partners, so that they get the full impact of NetApp's enablement resources and so we've got a narrow group that we work with, and we're pleased with the progress so far. Before we close, I want to underscore a few key points. NetApp is helping customers deliver enormous business value in both traditional IT-led and increasingly in cloud-led use cases. Only NetApp has the strategy, the broad innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multicloud IT. We believe we can return to growth over time by selling the value of our differentiated portfolio and investing in additional sales capacity to reach new buyers. As I saw at Insight and Ignite, we are making real progress here. We continue to be disciplined in our spending and have a strong financial model with growing gross margins and operating margins that enable us to return cash to shareholders and invest in the long-term health of our business. Thank you. And I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

My name is Latif and I will your conference call coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please proceed Ms. Newton.\nKris Newton: Thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2020 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects such as our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2020. Our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, shareholder returns and our ability to improve execution, gain share and expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.  We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons including macroeconomic and market conditions, the IT capital spending environment and our ability to expand our total available market, acquire new accounts and new buyers, expand in existing accounts, capitalize on our data fabric strategy, improve the consistency of our sales execution and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019 including the Management\u2019s Discussion Analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factor sections and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website.  I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian : Thanks Kris. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we discussed on our call on August 1, while I'm clearly disappointed in our weaker than expected top line results, the fundamentals of our business are robust and I am confident that we have the right strategy and technologies to address the market transitions to all-flash arrays, Private Cloud, and Cloud Data Services.  We have a strong business model as a result of the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and cost structure over the last several years. This enables us to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and make the strategic moves that position us well to return to growth.  We have further analyzed the dynamics of what happened in the first quarter and they confirm that we are seeing a combination of slowdown related to overall macro conditions and company-specific, go-to-market execution issues. We continue to see pressure on deal sizes, longer sales cycles, and deferral of transactions. But as I noted on our earlier call, our underperformance is not across the Board. Our APAC, Europe, and U.S. Public Sector geographies were mostly on track.  Even in the areas where we experienced the greatest weakness, top global accounts and the Americas, there were pockets of strength and high performing teams. We have been very successful with some of our global accounts, but we need to expand our wallet share in others. We have deep relationships with too few of these customers, which increases our susceptibility to a slowdown in spending related to the macro.  In the Americas roughly 40% of our districts were successful in acquiring new customers, reaching new buyers within existing customers and effectively selling our entire portfolio, and as a result grew year-over-year.  Performance across districts is inconsistent. Our sales leadership and I are committed to improving our sales execution through necessary leadership changes, better inspection, and discipline, expanded account coverage, acquisition and portfolio selling.  Let me underscore the fact that we do not believe that the revenue shortfall was related to a change in the competitive environment. Our win rates remain constant and our product gross margins remain strong. In short, we need to replicate our proven areas of success by getting in front of more buyers with our full portfolio.  To better capitalize on our opportunity, we will expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses, by continuing to make disciplined tradeoffs in our spending priorities. To that end, I will now provide more detail on the specific steps we are taking.  First, we plan to add approximately 200 primary sales resources in the next 12 months with a focus in the Americas. We will do this without increasing the total operating expenses for the company. The new sales headcount will focus on acquiring new accounts as well as engaging new buyers and finding new opportunities in existing accounts.  Second, we will sharpen the focus of our all-flash, go-to-market, including marketing sales and services to emphasize our strong value proposition in mission critical environments where customers continue to prioritize spending. We expect that this, combined with additional sales capacity will return us to a position of growth in the all-flash market.  Third, now that our services are generally available in Azure and will soon be in Google, we expect to see an acceleration of Cloud Data Services revenue as their sales teams ramp in selling our service. We continue to focus on expanding the range of use cases and deployment scenarios and enabling the various pathways to market to sell these services.  And finally, we will scale our growth in the Private Cloud market through focused marketing and sales efforts. The increased sales capacity focused on reaching non-storage buyers will support this effort. We are materially stepping-up our efforts to address the appropriate buyers for our Private Cloud and Cloud Data Services offering as they are different from our traditional storage buyers. To recap, I am confident that we can return to growth by increasing our sales capacity, adding new accounts, reaching new non-storage buyers, and selling the full portfolio. We expect that these efforts will accelerate our participation in the growing Private Cloud and Cloud Data Services markets and drive share gains. Additionally, these actions will broaden our pipeline, while lowering risks stemming from customer concentration.  In Q1 our all-flash array business inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF, and SolidFire products and services declined 24% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run-rate of $1.7 billion. This comparison includes a significant amount of ELA revenue related to all-flash in Q1 a year ago, that did not repeat in Q1 this year.  While I'm disappointed by the performance of this part of the business, I remain confident in our competitive positioning and our opportunity for continued success. We have industry leading, guaranteed storage efficiency, the highest performance and the most complete Cloud integration in the market today. And the actions we are taking to increase sales coverage and target mission critical workloads will help return our all-flash business to growth.  Moving to our Private Cloud Solutions, SolidFire NetApp HCI and Storage Grid are the building blocks for Private Cloud deployments, enabling customers to bring Public Cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. Our Private Cloud business, inclusive of products and services, attained an annualized net revenue run rate of $250 million in the first quarter, up 85% year-over-year.  Now on to Cloud Data Services. In Q1, we achieved general availability with Microsoft, with Azure NetApp Files, and beta release with Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud. Based on the last month of Q1, our annualized recurring revenue for Cloud Data Services increased to approximately $61 million, up 189% year-over-year. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our Cloud Services and expect that Cloud Services will continue to enable us to reach new buyers and contribute to our acquisition of new customers.  We are very pleased with the initial ramp of Azure NetApp Files since becoming generally available. I'll share a customer example to illustrate why we're so excited.  We are working with a Fortune 10 company to meet its Cloud First Initiative. While delivering an equal or better experience to their on-premises environment, with all the agility benefits of the Cloud. The customer began testing Azure NetApp Files while it was in preview and now that it\u2019s generally available, they've established a footprint of almost two petabytes and are growing by a 100 terabyte per week. While some of this data will migrate from existing NetApp Systems, roughly two-thirds of the data they will move to Azure NetApp files, currently resides on Competitor Storage Systems. Our sales team partnered closely with the Azure team to leverage our expertise to help the customer establish a data strategy in the Cloud.  By working directly with the customers Cloud leadership, we have moved from being merely an infrastructure provider with a minority position in the customer's data center, to a key strategic partner. This is a great example on not only how our Cloud Strategy helps us expand our opportunity by displacing competitive footprint, but how also reaching new buyers; in this case the Cloud team contributes to our growth. As I have described many times, customers and partners are choosing NetApp because of our data fabric strategy and our unique relationships with the hyperscale Cloud providers. Before closing, I would like to acknowledge and thank some longtime NetAppers who are moving on for their contributions to our company. Tom Mendoza, Vice Chairman; Joel Reich, EVP Storage Systems and Software Business Unit; and Thomas Stanley, Senior VP of the Americas; we wish them all well.  As we align to execute and thrive in a highly dynamic environment, change is inevitable. To that end, I'd like to recognize two key promotions; Brad Anderson to EVP and GM, overseeing both our Cloud Infrastructure and Storage Systems and Software Business Units; and Scott Allen to Chief Accounting Officer. I would also like to welcome Sanjay Rohatgi, Senior VP and GM of Asia Pacific. I look forward to their contributions in the continuing evolution of NetApp. I am confident in our strategy and the fundamentals of our business model. Our continued strong cash generation is a great example of the underlying health of our business. We remain committed to our capital allocation policy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and the recently increased quarterly dividend.  We will remain fiscally disciplined with our expenditures, while still investing for the long term health of our business. We consistently receive positive feedback from our customers and partners on the value of our data fabric strategy and the strong performance of our best teams demonstrates our ability to capitalize on the strength.  We are confident that we can return to growth by replicating their success in reaching more customers and buying centers with our full portfolio. We will keep you updated on the progress of these initiatives on future calls.  I'll now turn the call over to Ron. Ron?\nRon Pasek: Thanks, George. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. To reiterate George's sentiment, we are clearly disappointed with the Q1 results and are committed to addressing the challenges we faced during the quarter.  Despite the magnitude of our Q1 revenue shortfall, the gross margin and cost structure improvements we've made over the last three years provide support for our free cash flow generation. As a result, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy of returning cast to shareholders to share buybacks and our recently increased quarterly dividend.  Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q1 performance. In Q1, net revenues of $1.236 billion were down 16% year-over-year, including over 1 point of currency headwind. Product revenue of $644 million decreased approximately 26% year-over-year. As a reminder, the Q1 \u201819 compare includes $90 million of ELA revenues which did not repeat this quarter. Adjusting for ELAs Q1 revenue would have been down approximately 11% and product revenues would have been down approximately 18%.  Moving down the P&L, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $523 million decreased 1% year-over-year and was flat when adjusting for currency. Deferred revenue which was up 8% year-over-year in Q1 continues to be a strong indicator of the health of our installed base.  As we mentioned on the Q4 call, and to provide greater insight into the dynamics of our business, we have updated our strategic and mature product view. Strategic product revenue includes add-on software, Private Cloud Solutions, and all products related to all-flash arrays. Mature product revenue now includes OEM and all products related to disk and hybrid arrays. A historical recast of the strategic mature break-out can be found on our website. As a reminder, Cloud Data Services revenue is included in software and maintenance.  Gross margin of 67.2% was above the high end of our guidance range and includes approximately a 0.5 point of currency headwind. Product gross margin was 53.4%, which is an increase of 2.8 points year-over-year when adjusting for ELAs.  The increase was driven by sales force discipline and cost reduction and includes nearly a point of currency headwinds. Q1 was the 10th straight quarter we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs.  The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 82.1% increased by 50 basis points year-over-year. Q1 operating expenses of $652 million were flat year-over-year, operating margin was 14.4%.  EPS of $0.65 was above the preliminary estimate we provided on our August 1 call, but below our original guidance range. We closed Q1 with $3.5 billion in cash and short term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 10 days, up 10 days year-over-year. DSO of 40 days was up two days year-over-year and down 30 days sequentially. The under performance in revenue in the quarter drove DIO to 25 days, an 8 day increase year-over-year.  We expect our cash conversion cycle to remain negative throughout fiscal 2020. Despite the revenue shortfall in the quarter, cash flow from operations was $310 million. Free cash flow of $278 million represented 22% of revenues and was up approximate 6% year-over-year.  During Q1 we repurchased 3.9 million shares at an average price of $64.87 for a total of $250 million, which is consistent with our planned run rate heading into fiscal 2020. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $243 million, down $26 million year-over-year representing a 10% decrease. During the quarter we paid out $115 million in cash dividends. In total we returned $365 million to shareholders representing 131% of free cash flow generated in the quarter. Our fiscal Q2 cash dividend is $0.48 per share.  Now on to guidance. As we discussed on our August 1 call, we expect revenues for fiscal 2020 to be down between 5% and 10% year-over-year. We continue to expect sequential growth within the year to be consistent with our normal seasonal patterns, except for the volatility introduced by ELAs. For fiscal 2020 we now expect gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%, above our previous guidance range of 64% to 65%, due primarily to the mix shift towards higher margin maintenance revenues as a result of the weakness in product sales.  Operating margin for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 19% to 22%. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be flat to slightly down year-over-year in fiscal 2020.  As George highlighted, we expect at add 200 headcount to our sales coverage model over the next 12 months. As a result of the current revenue guidance, we expect EPS to be down between 2% and 15% year-over-year without the benefit of buy backs.  Given the relative weakness of America's business in Q1, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19% in fiscal 2020. Additionally we expect to continue to generate meaningful free cash flow in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues.  Now onto Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.325 billion and $1.475 billion, which at the midpoint implies an 8% decline in revenues year-over-year, including over a point of currency headwind.  For Q2 we expect consolidated gross margin to be approximate 66% and operating margin to be between 18% and 19%. We expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range between $0.91 and $0.99 per share.  We are diligently focused on improved execution and addressing the challenges we face. We are committed to returning the company to grow as we implement the action plan George outlined, and we remain confident our business model leverage will enable us to deliver long term shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back to Kris s to open the call for Q&A. Kris. \nKris Newton: We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from a line of Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is open. \nNehal Chokshi: Thank you. You probably covered this in the script, but your guidance does call for a significant improvement in the year-of-year revenue growth profile, and I appreciate all the detail on what you are doing to address the shortfall. Is it true to say that these things that you're doing, you expect to actually results in that improvement this quickly? \nRon Pasek: If you look at our Q2 seasonality, there are sort of two or three elements that come into play. The first is Q2 is typically a strong quarter for our U.S. public sector business. The second is, Cloud Data Services and our Private Cloud business should continue to perform in a normal seasonal acceleration model, and then the third is that we have factored in and probability weighted a little impact from ELAs in Q2. As you might note from the call script, we did not see any ELAs in Q1. \nNehal Chokshi: Understood. Okay, and then the deferred revenue continues to trend up year-over-year despite the significant year-over-year product revenue decline, below even the July 2015 and July 2016 levels. Is it safe to say that this is a reflection of an increase in attachment of software and services per dollar of installed base? \nGeorge Kurian: So, it's a function of several things, that's one. It's also a function of we're doing a little better job on renewals and point of sales. The point of sales rate for services held steady. So, you know, it\u2019s a focus area and has been for a while, we told you that, and we're doing a little better in it. \nNehal Chokshi: Okay, great. Thank you. \nKris Newton : Thanks Nehal. Next question? \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. \nRod Hall: Yeah, thanks for the question guys. I wanted to start off I guess with the AFA weakness you called out George and fee of \u2013 yet, it looks like I mean if we back that out, the hybrid trajectory was okay. I mean things seem more stable there, so I wonder if you could just drill into that in a little bit more detail, what you see going on there. Is it the factor of this macro weakness or are you seeing people backing off of AFA investment, but keeping up with hybrid.  And then I wanted to just double-check this as a housekeeping measure. You are guiding with ELAs in the guide this quarter. Just wanted to check that, because I thought previously you guys had decided not to guide ELAs anymore. So thanks. \nRon Pasek: So Ron, so it\u2019s factored in with a probability. So there's some in there, we factored it down a little bit, just in case, so \u2013 and there was some in there last year, so that\u2019s a fair compare. But we didn\u2019t put it in at the full value. \nGeorge Kurian: With regard to the mix of AFA\u2019s and hybrid, you know if you recall last year we had two elements that drove the AFA business. The first was we had several large global customers that purchased a lot of AFAs, and as we noted on our call, those customers are most impacted by the spending slowdown in the hardware.  The second was that we also had about $90 million of ELAs last year, and a good chunk of that was attributed to all-flash purchases. So those two one-time items, on the compare was what drove the AFA number down substantially more than HFA. I would not say that there was any pattern of customers not choosing AFAs as opposed to HFAs in the broad demand environment. \nRod Hall: Okay, great. Thank you, George. \nKris Newton : Thanks Rod. Next question? \nOperator: Next question comes from Matt Cabral of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMatt Cabral : Thank you. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what's driving the uptick in gross margin guidance for the year, and in particular just how we should think about the trajectory of product margins against just the potential for a pickup in the competitive environment if some of the slower deal environment lingers a little bit. \nRon Pasek: Yes, so there is a couple of factors. The biggest one is, obviously, you can see that in the quarter as well. You know the product revenue was down year-over-year. So, as a result, the services margin which is higher than product weighs higher on the overall margin and pushes the overall margin up.  Having said that, we\u2019ve told you for the last several years we're working on improving gross margins. We've had 10 consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement on the product margin side and that should continue throughout the year a little bit, both from a pricing standpoint and then some costs as well. \nGeorge Kurian: I want to call out the good work done by our sales teams on maintaining discipline. I know that, you know there are some people who think that there's a tradeoff between revenue and margin. I think our teams have remained disciplined around the pricing environment. The strong gross margin indicates our competitive differentiation, and we have not walked away from revenue due to concerns about gross margin. We have strategically used gross margin and our business model as an opportunity where we felt like it warranted it. \nMatt Cabral : Thank you.\nKris Newton : Thanks Matt. Next question?\nOperator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open. \nMehdi Hosseini : Yes, thanks for taking my question. George, going back to your comment on AFA. It seems to me that even if I were to exclude the ELA from FY \u201919 the overall AFA revenue could be down in the high teen, FY \u201920 versus FY \u201919, is that a fare assumption? \nGeorge Kurian: It is down a good amount. I think it is primarily due to you know our exposure from being very broadly deployed in big global strategic accounts that did not have as robust a spending pattern this year. The AFA business is the dominant business that we have in the big global customers and they were the most impacted by some of the uncertainty that we saw with regard to macro. \nKris Newton : Thank you, Mehdi. Next question?\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. \nAndrew Nowinski: Great, thank you. I just had a question on your OEM business. Last quarter you talked about moving away from some OEM partners and focusing more, on more strategic partners such as Lenovo. I think the OEM revenues included in the mature segments. I was wondering is that $307 million you did in mature this quarter in-line with what you're expecting or did you also see weakness at your OEM partners? Thanks. \nRon Pasek: We saw a little bit of weakness, and as you know it can be fairly lumpy, it's hard to predict often times what OEM customers are going to buy. We feel comfortable with the outlook for the year for OEM, which as we told you last quarter is probably not as robust and we are accepting that, but again we didn\u2019t see a robust quarter this quarter, we do expect to make the year as planned. \nGeorge Kurian: OEM is a small percentage of the mature category. It\u2019s frankly the smallest percentage of the matured category. We are driving focus on Lenovo and it'll take some time for that business to wrap. Once it ramps, it will stabilize the OEM revenue. \nAndrew Nowinski: Alright, thanks. \nKris Newton : Thanks Andy. Next question? \nOperator: Next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nKaty Huberty: Yes, thank you. George you talked about why your Flash business in particular is down double digits this quarter given that the large enterprise exposure. What do you think the market for flash storage did in the quarter, the market also declining? And then can you talk about how long it will take for the 200 new hires to reach their full sales quota and what would be the funding source of those given you don't expect to grow OpEx? Thanks. \nGeorge Kurian: I couldn't comment yet on the overall Flash market Katy. I think that our view is that as NAND prices remain low, you know Flash is compellingly better technology than disc for a broad range of you know transactional applications and so as a percentage of a mix, it should benefit from the fact that NAND prices are lower.  In terms of the head count that \u2013 so we are going to have to wait to see what other people report and sort of an overall market wrap-up to comment about Flash. We think that in our case the concentration of our largest customers, also being our largest Flash customers drove the sort of change in our Flash business.  With regard to the investment we're making in sales and primary demand creation headcount, they are not all discreet quarter bearing headcount; there are some technical sales headcount as well. We are going to do that over 12 months. I think you will see a ramp through that period as we get operationally ready and deploy the sales headcount and so you should quarterize 200 over four quarters and it typically takes us about three to four quarters to get them fully productive after they are onboard. \nKaty Huberty: Thank you. \nGeorge Kurian: With regard to what tradeoffs we're going to make, listen we've done a good job making tradeoffs over the last several years. You can see that in our, you know our operating margins and gross margins and will continue to make the appropriate choice of to prioritize our investments into the biggest opportunities.  We think we have a really good portfolio and we think that based on the results we're seeing with our best team, we can deploy more headcount and capture more of the market footprint and so we're going to stay disciplined around that. \nGeorge Kurian: Thanks Katy. Next question? \nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore IS. Your line is open. \nAmit Daryanani : Thanks a lot guys. I guess George, I was hoping to talk a little bit about how do you see the cloud services business ramping up through the fiscal year and you were clearly positive I think on how the Azure ramp has gone, especially for the GA. I was wondering, how would you contrast the Google process as you go forward and how do you think that would be comparable or different, what\u2019s going to happen with Azure, especially given the fact Google I think bought something comparable in Elastifile recently.\nA - George Kurian: First of all, we are very pleased with the progress of our product services business. It\u2019s up 189% year-over-year and I think the range of things that we see, the differentiation of our technology, the ability to you know migrate big customer workloads in a really cost effective manner to the public cloud and to be able to display its competitive footprint, they are all showing up.  I think with regard to the plan of what we're executing too, it is to qualify more workload and to get deployed into more data centers, that gives us a broader footprint of opportunity to go after. To train the sales force, both the Microsoft sales force and the NetApp sales force around you know selling these technologies in joint ways and that'll take time you know. These are big teams and it takes us time to get all of them trained. So you should expect a ramp through the course of the year getting stronger each quarter as more people are enabled.  With regard to Google, you know we think that we have as good an opportunity to migrate customer workloads to the Google cloud. Elastifile is not a competitive product to what we have. It's a commodity offering to compete with the low end file storage service; it's not an enterprise grade file storage service, and so we feel that our opportunity is undiminished.  We are in beta and we are focused on the next step, which is to get the general availability. So far what we see is you know similar pattern of customer trials, testing and so on and so we've done operational readiness with one cloud provider, we're going to work on the second and then as we get to GA we\u2019ll give you more details about it. \nAmit Daryanani : Perfect! Thanks for the insight. \nA - George Kurian: Thanks to Amit. Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open. \nSteven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for all the color on the quarter. I'm just struggling a little bit with the assumption that some of the macro weakness is fairly compartmentalized around the large EOMs. Is there any other points or conversations you can point to rather that would say that you don't see further weakness in some smaller customers in Europe and the U.S. Going forward I\u2019m just curious, the confidence level in the macro at this point. Thanks. \nA - George Kurian: I think that you know our perspective on the macro is very similar to what is reflected in the public commentary on the markets. We saw weakness in certain parts of Europe where GDP growth is challenged. For example, in Germany a little bit and in the UK where the you know sort of ongoing dialogue on Brexit is causing temporary pauses in spending, and then we saw it in the global customers who we do a lot of business with, right.  I think we did not say that the enterprises that were at the next year down weren't exposed to the macro. It's our exposure to a particular customer is a lot lower when they are smaller and we have a diverse book of business in the smaller and mid-sized customers than in the giant global customers. So I would tell you that what we experienced was the combination of macro and the big relationships that we have with some of these large global accounts. \nSteven Fox : That's helpful. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thanks Steve. Next question? \nOperator: Next question comes from Lou Miscioscia of Daiwa Capital Market. Your line is open. \nLou Miscioscia : Okay, thank you. I guess George, if you could give us a view as to how I guess you viewed the sales operation since when you came in. I think that if we go back to 2015 when you first started, one of the options I think your predecessors had talked about was materially increasing the sales force, because he viewed that as that would fix some of the problems.  And I guess the question I have and a bit of the difficulty I have is here we are ex number of years later. I realize the macro is very weak, so can fully understand that, but you would think that the sales force would be at a run rate level now, after all these years, that you know you wouldn\u2019t have to go out and either a) increase it and I'm not saying that that's wrong, but also b) that there\u2019s a high level of ones that you talked about in the last call that were not the appropriate productive level. I think we would be at a pretty good steady state.  So if you could just help us understand that and maybe also a milestone or a number. You\u2019re adding 200. I mean how big is the sales force, at least maybe that will help us understand that statistically maybe why there's a couple of issues here, thank you. \nA - George Kurian: I think first of all you know with regard to the work that we've done in the field organization, as we have said, we have transformed many, many elements of the field organization, particularly by implementing a coverage model that allows us to prioritize our resources against the biggest accounts and the biggest opportunities.  We started the implementation of coverage against the big global account in a more systematic way two to three years ago, which is what drove the results that we had alongside the big global accounts. We don't cover 100% of the largest 2000 to 3000 accounts in the world and we believe given the results that we\u2019ve had, that we have the opportunity by expanding coverage to a broader set of accounts that we can grow our business.  We have also implemented new selling motions right, like covering certain markets through the channel. You saw us restructuring parts of our European organization, so that we could afford the investments in covering the bigger accounts in the bigger countries by moving some of our countries, approximately 15 of them to be served through the channel. We have constructed a joint venture in China together with Lenovo, so that he could participate in the China market in a more efficient fashion.  So we've done a lot of things to change the structure and the composition of the sales force. We think that by adding you know a combination of resources to go after the market, approximately 8% to 10% increase in coverage, we should be able to continue to grow our business in the top line, which is the fundamental issue we've had.  You know if you look at the rest of the P&L, we've had an exceptionally strong result across gross margin, operating margin and all of the other elements of cash generation, and we think that this is specifically a top line issue. We think that by broadening our coverage and footprint, we should be able to mitigate the impact of the macro on a few large customers that today we are exposed to. \nLou Miscioscia : Okay, thank you.\nA - George Kurian: Thanks Lou. Next question? \nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Long of Barclays. Your line is open. \nTim Long : Thank you. If I could just ask kind of a two-parter here on visibility. Obviously what happens last quarter took us a little bit by surprise. Can you just talk a little bit about you know this full year view and how you feel about the second half and did you do some factoring of kind of pipeline like you did for the ELAs in the quarter.  And then just Ron, if you could remind me the visibility into the installed base. I guess that the deferred rose, but we did have you know a decline in a few of the revenue lines, the product services and hardware maintenance. So if you could just flush out for us that installed base view, that would be great. Thank you. \nRon Pasek: Okay, so let me start with that one. So you know when you look at maintenance you've got to kind of combine the software maintenance and hardware maintenance together, because we have changed the values associated with each over a period of time, certainly as it relates to the newly installed base.  When you add them together they are down 1% year-over-year and when you adjust for FX they are flat. The fact of the matter is we are growing our installed base of systems under contract and have been for really, for the last eight quarters. So it's actually very healthy what you see reflected for the revenue number. \nGeorge Kurian: With regard to our outlook for the rest of the year, you know we are not expecting rapid resolution of either the macro or some of the uncertainty around trade and so we factored in a fairly conservative profile and outlook in the overall picture. Either it\u2019s reflective of typical linearity based on a very slow start in Q1 or you know it includes some of the fact that our second half has an easier compare compared to our first half of this year, and so we are not expecting some miraculous rebound in terms of the macro environment.  I think with regard to ELAs, you know as we said ELAs comprise about 2% of the revenue in the year. We don't break it out on a per quarter basis. You should factor in some sort of run rate for ELAs within our broader guidance. \nRon Pasek: Just to add to that Tim, remember we have no ELAs in Q1, limited in Q2, so most of the ELAs will happen in the second half, actually it helps with the second half. \nTim Long : Okay. Thank you. \nKris Newton : Thanks Tim. Next question?\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is open. \nJim Suva: Thanks very much, Ron and George. A quick question for each of you. Ron you just mentioned limited ELAs next quarter and then more in the second half if I heard that correctly, and when you say more in the second half, do we think then about an annual run rate that you've been talking off, or how should we think about the ELAs in the second half.  And then George if you could help us understand, adding 200 sales people in America, that's very good and a couple of quarters to ramp, but I think I heard you say no additional expenses. So how does that work out? Is that just a reallocation or how do you work out more people with no additional costs? \nRon Pasek: Yeah, so just on the ELAs, you know I won\u2019t give you the number in Q2 but it\u2019s not huge. Obviously I factored it down, which means that mostly the ELAs will be in the second half. Again to George\u2019s point, we told you that ELAs are roughly 2% of total revenue. So you should expect the majority of that in the second half of the year. \nGeorge Kurian: With regard to the sales capacity, as I said you know they are not all primary quarter bearing headcount. The majority of the 200 should be quarter bearing headcount, but it\u2019s a combination of frontline quarterbacking headcount, technical resources and management.  We are going to deploy them in a graded fashion over four quarters and you should expect a ramp through those quarters as we get the operational momentum of hiring and all of that in place. It takes three to four quarters as we\u2019ve said consistently for a sales rep to get productive, right and some of these are going to be focused on selling our Private Cloud and Public Cloud portfolios, which have a different business model or profile than a traditional storage system.  With regard to how do we expect to hire 200 people and not impact you know operating expensive, I\u2019ll just say we have north of 10,500 people on the company payroll and so we\u2019ll make the appropriate tradeoffs across our broader employee population as we think about people leave the company and you know the shape of people we hire will ship it towards the sales organization, so that we can you know accelerate the turnaround.\nJim Suva: Great, thank you so much for the details and clarifications. That\u2019s great, we appreciated it. \nGeorge Kurian: Thank you, Jim. \nKris Newton : Thank you, Jim. Next question? \nOperator: The next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Our line is open. \nAaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to Amit's question earlier on the Cloud Data Services business. First of all, just a kind of clarification. You know relatively to what you said on the pre-announcement and now today, are you endorsing the fact that you still believe you'll be at that 400-plus million run rate exiting fiscal 21.  And then kind of building on that, one of the comments in the prepared remarks that you know CDS is ramping and there are some elements of cannibalization to the traditional business. I'm trying to understand how you think about that. You know should we consider that as CDS ramps there there's going to be some cannibalization of the traditional on premise business for you guys. Just get any kind of clarification or help on that would be useful. \nGeorge Kurian: First of all I think we are pleased, with the momentum that we have in the CDS business. We still have the plan to be in the $400 billion to $600 million annual recurring run rate exiting Q4 of fiscal 21, and we are executing to that plan. There's a lot of work that goes into that, but having a leading hyper scalar like Microsoft now generally available is a good benchmark and the next benchmark is to scale them and to get Google Cloud Platform to general availability. So our heads down on executing our game plan.  I think with regard to the base of customer adoption, we feel very good about the early results, right and I think that you should see that ramp through the course of the year.  With regard to cannibalization, I would just tell you that you know the fact that NetApp technology is available in the Microsoft Cloud or the Google Cloud, doesn't necessarily mean that the customer is going to move the NetApp workloads first to the cloud. They have a pattern of workloads they want to move to the cloud, we get to participate in a much broader opportunity, as a result of having our technology now being the enterprise platform for both Microsoft and Google, at the expense of our competition, right. That loses every dollar that moves to the cloud, they're going to get zero. We get to participate in two of the biggest hyper-scalers now capturing those workloads onto our platform. Does it on the margin cause some cannibalization? That's already factored into the on-premise business versus the public cloud business forecasts that people have. We just now get to participate in a much more meaningful way in the public cloud business than anybody else. And in some ways that is also helping us now, with new footprint on-premises as customers and now say,\u201d listen, I discovered NetApp in the public cloud. I want to give them a bigger footprint on-prem.\u201d\nAaron Rakers: Very helpful, thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks Aaron. Next question?\nOperator: The next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nAnanda Baruah: Good afternoon, I appreciate you taking the questions. Yeah, just going back to AFA, I guess just a two-part for both George and Ron if I could. We'd love to get a sense of, if you're seeing incremental pricing pressure over the last couple of quarters in AFA, even if it's from the customers as the deal sizes have shrunk a bit? And then just sticking with AFA, I'd love to get a sense of if you think that macro aside just industry penetration, the velocity of industry penetration has been slowing at all and your thoughts around that. Thanks a lot.\nGeorge Kurian: You know, I'll tell you what we saw with our AFA business is that customers bought more of the mid-range configurations and you know bought the capacity that they needed for the next year rather than rightsizing the equipment for a three-year outlook, right? And that is, you know what I would do if I were faced with an uncertain budget environment, so we did see that fairly systematically.  I think with regard to AFA versus the overall storage market, I think that the economics of AFAs compared to hybrid continues to grow and get better, right? If you look at NAND prices, they continue to make AFA a much more attractive value proposition than they were in the past, every quarter, and so if I were a customer, I would continue to prioritize AFA for all by transactional applications. The overall landscape for storage is dependent on the macro, and so I don't see the mix changing. I just look at the overall water level being determined by the macro.\nAnanda Baruah: Okay, got it. That's helpful. I appreciate the context. Thanks.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Ananda. Next question?\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street. Your line is open.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yeah, I just wanted to clarify, a couple of weeks ago you talked about the shortfall being about two-thirds macro, one-third NetApp-specific. I wanted to make sure that was, you still felt that was the case after a couple of weeks of analysis? And then second part of the question has to do with, you've turned over your EVP, Americas. Wondering if there is any turnover below that senior level, because obviously that would make the adding to the sales more of a back-end loaded 2020 effort. I would think that that might slow things down on the sales hiring.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think that our analysis leads us to draw the same conclusion, which is its two-third macro, one-third, yes we could have executed better. We did see some exposure from our \u2013 being concentrated in some of the larger accounts, right, and I think that that's consistent.  I want to just say that our leadership team, we wish all of the members of our leadership team well. We have the need to continue to add capacity. That's the fundamental area of focus for us. We'll continue to inspect our business and we'll provide you updates on our execution improvements over time. I'll just leave it there.\nEric Martinuzzi: But were there second level turnover, obviously there was at the EVP level, but kind of one level down from that?\nGeorge Kurian: No.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay, thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Eric. Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes for Andrew Vadheim of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAndrew Vadheim: Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the full-year outlook and what role macro plays. So if you look at 1Q regarding the geographic breakdown of your revs, focusing on EMEA and APAC, 1Q numbers were pretty close to our expectations. And if you link the geographic split back to your full year guide, are you embedding sort of a flat or slightly down EMEA, and APAC for the year. And then uncertainty in Americas gets you to down 10 at the low end to down five at the high-end or does the bottom/top of the range embed a bull-bear case for EMEA and APAC?\nRon Pasek: You know I'd rather not go into some of the specific assumptions we made by geo. I think we did look at several things. We looked at what we're seeing in the macro environment in each of those geographies, we talked at the local sales leadership etcetera.  We are making judgments overall, so I can't tell you the exact trade-offs we made, but we are looking at a downsize down 10% for the year. So obviously you'll see that probably most profoundly down in the Americas, kind of given where we are, but beyond that I'm not going to give any other detail.\nGeorge Kurian: I'll just say I think all of the calculations and factors we considered are you know in the public domain, right, and we use those factors to determine broad-based economic trajectories and then combine that with the judgment and the pipeline data of our sales teams and the historical linearity pattern of our business.\nKris Newton: Alright, thank you Andrew. Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from Nick Todorov of Longbow Research. Your line is open.\nNick Todorov: Hi, thanks for taking the question. You guys talked about customer concentration a couple of times today. Can you give us a little bit more color, maybe an example of how much revenue you\u2019re top 10 or 15 customers account for?\nGeorge Kurian: We are not going to break that out. I would just say that the impact of what happened during the quarter was primarily due to the fact that some of our largest global accounts that we have very strategic relationships with, you know did not spend anywhere close to what they spent last year. I'll give you an example. We had two large customers that are exposed to the China tariff situation that have cut their capital spending by north of 30% year-on-year. Clearly we are a part of that spending profile and so I would just say that we have really good relationships with the big set of customers and we are planning to broaden those relationships to another broader set of customers over the course of the next year to 18 months.\nNick Todorov: Okay. And can I squeeze one more in? Can you remind us how much you have remaining on your buyback authorization? And that'll be from me. Thanks.\nRon Pasek: We have $1.6 billion left on the authorization.\nNick Todorov: Okay, thanks guys. Good luck.\nKris Newton: Thanks Nick. Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you. During the prepared remarks, you did indicate that you're not seeing any change in the competitive environment. I just wanted to maybe get a better understanding of whether or not we might see the market share shifts as measured by the third party that might reflect differences in geographies or differences in terms of footprint where maybe a competitor might be upgrading its legacy footprint and you've completed that task. Just trying to get a little bit of a better understanding of how you can be confident that it's not about competition and how to square this with third-party research? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think that you know what we mean when we say it's not a competitive factor is that our win rates in competitive transactions remains the same. Our product gross margins were up 280 basis points year-on-year when you adjust for ELAs, which shows the strength of our differentiation, right?  I think there may be differences in how the results play out for different providers depending on their customer basis. We did see exposure from our biggest customers not buying as much, right? And I think that what we are convinced off is that if we expand our footprint and broaden our customer coverage, given the strength of the performance we've had in the places where we saw you know budget available and our ability to win competitive transactions, we should be able to broaden our book of business and reduce the effects of customer concentration.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you for the clarification.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Simon. Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, I have two follow-ups. Ron, if I were just to look at your guide for the October quarter operating margin, it seems to me that OpEx would actually go up by $10 million to $15 million. Is that a fair assumption?\nRon Pasek: Yeah, I mean, it goes up as a function of revenue, sure.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, so just going back to the comment of adding additional sales people, this OpEx is just nature of the revenue and nothing to do with the recent months.\nRon Pasek: Yes. You won't see a huge impact to OpEx in the quarter for the hiring, it takes a while to get people onboard. You'll see some increase is baked in there, but most of that's just a function of the linearity throughout the year, linear revenues and the headcount structure. So. \nMehdi Hosseini: Sure. I just have a quick follow-up to the AFA question I asked earlier. Your comments suggested there is a high-teen decline in AFA revenue, FY'20 versus FY '19. But as I look at the back half of this FY\u201920, I see a nice rebound driven by the migration of the 10 K-RPM to SSD, and that should build momentum into calendar year \u2013 into the fiscal year '21. Is that a fair assumption as to what could drive a rebound in AFA?\nGeorge Kurian: I think first of all, what we said was it was reflective of Q1 results, Q1 FY '20 over Q1 FY '19 being down in the high teens, right?  I think with regard to the rest of the year, I'm not going to break out AFA versus HFA. I think that AFA is advantaged on a whole bunch of dimensions and should continue to get a bigger share of the pie of storage relative to HFA than it was in prior years, just because of NAND economics, QLC, all kinds of things.  I think we will continue to use every opportunity we can to drive transitions of disk-based systems and hybrid-based systems to our flash systems. The pace of those upgrades is a combination of, yes, good technology being available, but also budget cycles being available.  And so we're going to lean in on the technology side and give customers every opportunity to upgrade. But we'll have to wait to see how the macro plays out, to see how many of those budget cycles are available.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you. Mehdi. I'll now pass it back to George for a couple of closing comments.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. I'm disappointed in our weaker than expected top line results, but I remain confident that we have the right strategy and technology to address the key market transition. We have a strong business model, as a result of the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and cost structure over the last several years.  Our continued strong cash generation is a great example of the underlying health of our business. We will remain fiscally disciplined with our expenditures, while still investing for the long-term health of the business, and we remain committed to our capital allocation policy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and a quarterly dividend. The robust fundamentals of our business enable us to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and make the strategic moves that position us to return to growth.  I hope to see you at the Investors session of our Annual Insight User Conference on October 29 in Las Vegas. Thank you again. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

To reiterate George's sentiment, we are clearly disappointed with the Q1 results and are committed to addressing the challenges we faced during the quarter.  Despite the magnitude of our Q1 revenue shortfall, the gross margin and cost structure improvements we've made over the last three years provide support for our free cash flow generation. As a result, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy of returning cast to shareholders to share buybacks and our recently increased quarterly dividend.  Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q1 performance. In Q1, net revenues of $1.236 billion were down 16% year-over-year, including over 1 point of currency headwind. Product revenue of $644 million decreased approximately 26% year-over-year. As a reminder, the Q1 \u201819 compare includes $90 million of ELA revenues which did not repeat this quarter. Adjusting for ELAs Q1 revenue would have been down approximately 11% and product revenues would have been down approximately 18%.  Moving down the P&L, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $523 million decreased 1% year-over-year and was flat when adjusting for currency. Deferred revenue which was up 8% year-over-year in Q1 continues to be a strong indicator of the health of our installed base.  As we mentioned on the Q4 call, and to provide greater insight into the dynamics of our business, we have updated our strategic and mature product view. Strategic product revenue includes add-on software, Private Cloud Solutions, and all products related to all-flash arrays. Mature product revenue now includes OEM and all products related to disk and hybrid arrays. A historical recast of the strategic mature break-out can be found on our website. As a reminder, Cloud Data Services revenue is included in software and maintenance.  Gross margin of 67.2% was above the high end of our guidance range and includes approximately a 0.5 point of currency headwind. Product gross margin was 53.4%, which is an increase of 2.8 points year-over-year when adjusting for ELAs.  The increase was driven by sales force discipline and cost reduction and includes nearly a point of currency headwinds. Q1 was the 10th straight quarter we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs.  The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 82.1% increased by 50 basis points year-over-year. Q1 operating expenses of $652 million were flat year-over-year, operating margin was 14.4%.  EPS of $0.65 was above the preliminary estimate we provided on our August 1 call, but below our original guidance range. We closed Q1 with $3.5 billion in cash and short term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 10 days, up 10 days year-over-year. DSO of 40 days was up two days year-over-year and down 30 days sequentially. The under performance in revenue in the quarter drove DIO to 25 days, an 8 day increase year-over-year.  We expect our cash conversion cycle to remain negative throughout fiscal 2020. Despite the revenue shortfall in the quarter, cash flow from operations was $310 million. Free cash flow of $278 million represented 22% of revenues and was up approximate 6% year-over-year.  During Q1 we repurchased 3.9 million shares at an average price of $64.87 for a total of $250 million, which is consistent with our planned run rate heading into fiscal 2020. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $243 million, down $26 million year-over-year representing a 10% decrease. During the quarter we paid out $115 million in cash dividends. In total we returned $365 million to shareholders representing 131% of free cash flow generated in the quarter. Our fiscal Q2 cash dividend is $0.48 per share.  Now on to guidance. As we discussed on our August 1 call, we expect revenues for fiscal 2020 to be down between 5% and 10% year-over-year. We continue to expect sequential growth within the year to be consistent with our normal seasonal patterns, except for the volatility introduced by ELAs. For fiscal 2020 we now expect gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%, above our previous guidance range of 64% to 65%, due primarily to the mix shift towards higher margin maintenance revenues as a result of the weakness in product sales.  Operating margin for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 19% to 22%. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be flat to slightly down year-over-year in fiscal 2020.  As George highlighted, we expect at add 200 headcount to our sales coverage model over the next 12 months. As a result of the current revenue guidance, we expect EPS to be down between 2% and 15% year-over-year without the benefit of buy backs.  Given the relative weakness of America's business in Q1, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19% in fiscal 2020. Additionally we expect to continue to generate meaningful free cash flow in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues.  Now onto Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.325 billion and $1.475 billion, which at the midpoint implies an 8% decline in revenues year-over-year, including over a point of currency headwind.  For Q2 we expect consolidated gross margin to be approximate 66% and operating margin to be between 18% and 19%. We expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range between $0.91 and $0.99 per share.  We are diligently focused on improved execution and addressing the challenges we face. We are committed to returning the company to grow as we implement the action plan George outlined, and we remain confident our business model leverage will enable us to deliver long term shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back to Kris s to open the call for Q&A. Kris. If you look at our Q2 seasonality, there are sort of two or three elements that come into play. The first is Q2 is typically a strong quarter for our U.S. public sector business. The second is, Cloud Data Services and our Private Cloud business should continue to perform in a normal seasonal acceleration model, and then the third is that we have factored in and probability weighted a little impact from ELAs in Q2. As you might note from the call script, we did not see any ELAs in Q1. So Ron, so it's factored in with a probability. So there's some in there, we factored it down a little bit, just in case, so \u2013 and there was some in there last year, so that's a fair compare. But we didn't put it in at the full value. Yes, so there is a couple of factors. The biggest one is, obviously, you can see that in the quarter as well. You know the product revenue was down year-over-year. So, as a result, the services margin which is higher than product weighs higher on the overall margin and pushes the overall margin up.  Having said that, we've told you for the last several years we're working on improving gross margins. We've had 10 consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement on the product margin side and that should continue throughout the year a little bit, both from a pricing standpoint and then some costs as well. We saw a little bit of weakness, and as you know it can be fairly lumpy, it's hard to predict often times what OEM customers are going to buy. We feel comfortable with the outlook for the year for OEM, which as we told you last quarter is probably not as robust and we are accepting that, but again we didn't see a robust quarter this quarter, we do expect to make the year as planned. Okay, so let me start with that one. So you know when you look at maintenance you've got to kind of combine the software maintenance and hardware maintenance together, because we have changed the values associated with each over a period of time, certainly as it relates to the newly installed base.  When you add them together they are down 1% year-over-year and when you adjust for FX they are flat. The fact of the matter is we are growing our installed base of systems under contract and have been for really, for the last eight quarters. So it's actually very healthy what you see reflected for the revenue number. Just to add to that Tim, remember we have no ELAs in Q1, limited in Q2, so most of the ELAs will happen in the second half, actually it helps with the second half. Yeah, so just on the ELAs, you know I won't give you the number in Q2 but it's not huge. Obviously I factored it down, which means that mostly the ELAs will be in the second half. Again to George's point, we told you that ELAs are roughly 2% of total revenue. So you should expect the majority of that in the second half of the year. You know I'd rather not go into some of the specific assumptions we made by geo. I think we did look at several things. We looked at what we're seeing in the macro environment in each of those geographies, we talked at the local sales leadership etcetera.  We are making judgments overall, so I can't tell you the exact trade-offs we made, but we are looking at a downsize down 10% for the year. So obviously you'll see that probably most profoundly down in the Americas, kind of given where we are, but beyond that I'm not going to give any other detail. We have $1.6 billion left on the authorization. Yeah, I mean, it goes up as a function of revenue, sure. Yes. You won't see a huge impact to OpEx in the quarter for the hiring, it takes a while to get people onboard. You'll see some increase is baked in there, but most of that's just a function of the linearity throughout the year, linear revenues and the headcount structure. So."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks Kris. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we discussed on our call on August 1, while I'm clearly disappointed in our weaker than expected top line results, the fundamentals of our business are robust and I am confident that we have the right strategy and technologies to address the market transitions to all-flash arrays, Private Cloud, and Cloud Data Services.  We have a strong business model as a result of the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and cost structure over the last several years. This enables us to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and make the strategic moves that position us well to return to growth.  We have further analyzed the dynamics of what happened in the first quarter and they confirm that we are seeing a combination of slowdown related to overall macro conditions and company-specific, go-to-market execution issues. We continue to see pressure on deal sizes, longer sales cycles, and deferral of transactions. But as I noted on our earlier call, our underperformance is not across the Board. Our APAC, Europe, and U.S. Public Sector geographies were mostly on track.  Even in the areas where we experienced the greatest weakness, top global accounts and the Americas, there were pockets of strength and high performing teams. We have been very successful with some of our global accounts, but we need to expand our wallet share in others. We have deep relationships with too few of these customers, which increases our susceptibility to a slowdown in spending related to the macro.  In the Americas roughly 40% of our districts were successful in acquiring new customers, reaching new buyers within existing customers and effectively selling our entire portfolio, and as a result grew year-over-year.  Performance across districts is inconsistent. Our sales leadership and I are committed to improving our sales execution through necessary leadership changes, better inspection, and discipline, expanded account coverage, acquisition and portfolio selling.  Let me underscore the fact that we do not believe that the revenue shortfall was related to a change in the competitive environment. Our win rates remain constant and our product gross margins remain strong. In short, we need to replicate our proven areas of success by getting in front of more buyers with our full portfolio.  To better capitalize on our opportunity, we will expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses, by continuing to make disciplined tradeoffs in our spending priorities. To that end, I will now provide more detail on the specific steps we are taking.  First, we plan to add approximately 200 primary sales resources in the next 12 months with a focus in the Americas. We will do this without increasing the total operating expenses for the company. The new sales headcount will focus on acquiring new accounts as well as engaging new buyers and finding new opportunities in existing accounts.  Second, we will sharpen the focus of our all-flash, go-to-market, including marketing sales and services to emphasize our strong value proposition in mission critical environments where customers continue to prioritize spending. We expect that this, combined with additional sales capacity will return us to a position of growth in the all-flash market.  Third, now that our services are generally available in Azure and will soon be in Google, we expect to see an acceleration of Cloud Data Services revenue as their sales teams ramp in selling our service. We continue to focus on expanding the range of use cases and deployment scenarios and enabling the various pathways to market to sell these services.  And finally, we will scale our growth in the Private Cloud market through focused marketing and sales efforts. The increased sales capacity focused on reaching non-storage buyers will support this effort. We are materially stepping-up our efforts to address the appropriate buyers for our Private Cloud and Cloud Data Services offering as they are different from our traditional storage buyers. To recap, I am confident that we can return to growth by increasing our sales capacity, adding new accounts, reaching new non-storage buyers, and selling the full portfolio. We expect that these efforts will accelerate our participation in the growing Private Cloud and Cloud Data Services markets and drive share gains. Additionally, these actions will broaden our pipeline, while lowering risks stemming from customer concentration.  In Q1 our all-flash array business inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF, and SolidFire products and services declined 24% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run-rate of $1.7 billion. This comparison includes a significant amount of ELA revenue related to all-flash in Q1 a year ago, that did not repeat in Q1 this year.  While I'm disappointed by the performance of this part of the business, I remain confident in our competitive positioning and our opportunity for continued success. We have industry leading, guaranteed storage efficiency, the highest performance and the most complete Cloud integration in the market today. And the actions we are taking to increase sales coverage and target mission critical workloads will help return our all-flash business to growth.  Moving to our Private Cloud Solutions, SolidFire NetApp HCI and Storage Grid are the building blocks for Private Cloud deployments, enabling customers to bring Public Cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. Our Private Cloud business, inclusive of products and services, attained an annualized net revenue run rate of $250 million in the first quarter, up 85% year-over-year.  Now on to Cloud Data Services. In Q1, we achieved general availability with Microsoft, with Azure NetApp Files, and beta release with Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud. Based on the last month of Q1, our annualized recurring revenue for Cloud Data Services increased to approximately $61 million, up 189% year-over-year. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our Cloud Services and expect that Cloud Services will continue to enable us to reach new buyers and contribute to our acquisition of new customers.  We are very pleased with the initial ramp of Azure NetApp Files since becoming generally available. I'll share a customer example to illustrate why we're so excited.  We are working with a Fortune 10 company to meet its Cloud First Initiative. While delivering an equal or better experience to their on-premises environment, with all the agility benefits of the Cloud. The customer began testing Azure NetApp Files while it was in preview and now that it's generally available, they've established a footprint of almost two petabytes and are growing by a 100 terabyte per week. While some of this data will migrate from existing NetApp Systems, roughly two-thirds of the data they will move to Azure NetApp files, currently resides on Competitor Storage Systems. Our sales team partnered closely with the Azure team to leverage our expertise to help the customer establish a data strategy in the Cloud.  By working directly with the customers Cloud leadership, we have moved from being merely an infrastructure provider with a minority position in the customer's data center, to a key strategic partner. This is a great example on not only how our Cloud Strategy helps us expand our opportunity by displacing competitive footprint, but how also reaching new buyers; in this case the Cloud team contributes to our growth. As I have described many times, customers and partners are choosing NetApp because of our data fabric strategy and our unique relationships with the hyperscale Cloud providers. Before closing, I would like to acknowledge and thank some longtime NetAppers who are moving on for their contributions to our company. Tom Mendoza, Vice Chairman; Joel Reich, EVP Storage Systems and Software Business Unit; and Thomas Stanley, Senior VP of the Americas; we wish them all well.  As we align to execute and thrive in a highly dynamic environment, change is inevitable. To that end, I'd like to recognize two key promotions; Brad Anderson to EVP and GM, overseeing both our Cloud Infrastructure and Storage Systems and Software Business Units; and Scott Allen to Chief Accounting Officer. I would also like to welcome Sanjay Rohatgi, Senior VP and GM of Asia Pacific. I look forward to their contributions in the continuing evolution of NetApp. I am confident in our strategy and the fundamentals of our business model. Our continued strong cash generation is a great example of the underlying health of our business. We remain committed to our capital allocation policy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and the recently increased quarterly dividend.  We will remain fiscally disciplined with our expenditures, while still investing for the long term health of our business. We consistently receive positive feedback from our customers and partners on the value of our data fabric strategy and the strong performance of our best teams demonstrates our ability to capitalize on the strength.  We are confident that we can return to growth by replicating their success in reaching more customers and buying centers with our full portfolio. We will keep you updated on the progress of these initiatives on future calls.  I'll now turn the call over to Ron. Ron? So, it's a function of several things, that's one. It's also a function of we're doing a little better job on renewals and point of sales. The point of sales rate for services held steady. So, you know, it's a focus area and has been for a while, we told you that, and we're doing a little better in it. With regard to the mix of AFA's and hybrid, you know if you recall last year we had two elements that drove the AFA business. The first was we had several large global customers that purchased a lot of AFAs, and as we noted on our call, those customers are most impacted by the spending slowdown in the hardware.  The second was that we also had about $90 million of ELAs last year, and a good chunk of that was attributed to all-flash purchases. So those two one-time items, on the compare was what drove the AFA number down substantially more than HFA. I would not say that there was any pattern of customers not choosing AFAs as opposed to HFAs in the broad demand environment. I want to call out the good work done by our sales teams on maintaining discipline. I know that, you know there are some people who think that there's a tradeoff between revenue and margin. I think our teams have remained disciplined around the pricing environment. The strong gross margin indicates our competitive differentiation, and we have not walked away from revenue due to concerns about gross margin. We have strategically used gross margin and our business model as an opportunity where we felt like it warranted it. It is down a good amount. I think it is primarily due to you know our exposure from being very broadly deployed in big global strategic accounts that did not have as robust a spending pattern this year. The AFA business is the dominant business that we have in the big global customers and they were the most impacted by some of the uncertainty that we saw with regard to macro. OEM is a small percentage of the mature category. It's frankly the smallest percentage of the matured category. We are driving focus on Lenovo and it'll take some time for that business to wrap. Once it ramps, it will stabilize the OEM revenue. I couldn't comment yet on the overall Flash market Katy. I think that our view is that as NAND prices remain low, you know Flash is compellingly better technology than disc for a broad range of you know transactional applications and so as a percentage of a mix, it should benefit from the fact that NAND prices are lower.  In terms of the head count that \u2013 so we are going to have to wait to see what other people report and sort of an overall market wrap-up to comment about Flash. We think that in our case the concentration of our largest customers, also being our largest Flash customers drove the sort of change in our Flash business.  With regard to the investment we're making in sales and primary demand creation headcount, they are not all discreet quarter bearing headcount; there are some technical sales headcount as well. We are going to do that over 12 months. I think you will see a ramp through that period as we get operationally ready and deploy the sales headcount and so you should quarterize 200 over four quarters and it typically takes us about three to four quarters to get them fully productive after they are onboard. With regard to what tradeoffs we're going to make, listen we've done a good job making tradeoffs over the last several years. You can see that in our, you know our operating margins and gross margins and will continue to make the appropriate choice of to prioritize our investments into the biggest opportunities.  We think we have a really good portfolio and we think that based on the results we're seeing with our best team, we can deploy more headcount and capture more of the market footprint and so we're going to stay disciplined around that. Thanks Katy. Next question? With regard to our outlook for the rest of the year, you know we are not expecting rapid resolution of either the macro or some of the uncertainty around trade and so we factored in a fairly conservative profile and outlook in the overall picture. Either it's reflective of typical linearity based on a very slow start in Q1 or you know it includes some of the fact that our second half has an easier compare compared to our first half of this year, and so we are not expecting some miraculous rebound in terms of the macro environment.  I think with regard to ELAs, you know as we said ELAs comprise about 2% of the revenue in the year. We don't break it out on a per quarter basis. You should factor in some sort of run rate for ELAs within our broader guidance. With regard to the sales capacity, as I said you know they are not all primary quarter bearing headcount. The majority of the 200 should be quarter bearing headcount, but it's a combination of frontline quarterbacking headcount, technical resources and management.  We are going to deploy them in a graded fashion over four quarters and you should expect a ramp through those quarters as we get the operational momentum of hiring and all of that in place. It takes three to four quarters as we've said consistently for a sales rep to get productive, right and some of these are going to be focused on selling our Private Cloud and Public Cloud portfolios, which have a different business model or profile than a traditional storage system.  With regard to how do we expect to hire 200 people and not impact you know operating expensive, I'll just say we have north of 10,500 people on the company payroll and so we'll make the appropriate tradeoffs across our broader employee population as we think about people leave the company and you know the shape of people we hire will ship it towards the sales organization, so that we can you know accelerate the turnaround. Thank you, Jim. First of all I think we are pleased, with the momentum that we have in the CDS business. We still have the plan to be in the $400 billion to $600 million annual recurring run rate exiting Q4 of fiscal 21, and we are executing to that plan. There's a lot of work that goes into that, but having a leading hyper scalar like Microsoft now generally available is a good benchmark and the next benchmark is to scale them and to get Google Cloud Platform to general availability. So our heads down on executing our game plan.  I think with regard to the base of customer adoption, we feel very good about the early results, right and I think that you should see that ramp through the course of the year.  With regard to cannibalization, I would just tell you that you know the fact that NetApp technology is available in the Microsoft Cloud or the Google Cloud, doesn't necessarily mean that the customer is going to move the NetApp workloads first to the cloud. They have a pattern of workloads they want to move to the cloud, we get to participate in a much broader opportunity, as a result of having our technology now being the enterprise platform for both Microsoft and Google, at the expense of our competition, right. That loses every dollar that moves to the cloud, they're going to get zero. We get to participate in two of the biggest hyper-scalers now capturing those workloads onto our platform. Does it on the margin cause some cannibalization? That's already factored into the on-premise business versus the public cloud business forecasts that people have. We just now get to participate in a much more meaningful way in the public cloud business than anybody else. And in some ways that is also helping us now, with new footprint on-premises as customers and now say,\u201d listen, I discovered NetApp in the public cloud. I want to give them a bigger footprint on-prem.\u201d You know, I'll tell you what we saw with our AFA business is that customers bought more of the mid-range configurations and you know bought the capacity that they needed for the next year rather than rightsizing the equipment for a three-year outlook, right? And that is, you know what I would do if I were faced with an uncertain budget environment, so we did see that fairly systematically.  I think with regard to AFA versus the overall storage market, I think that the economics of AFAs compared to hybrid continues to grow and get better, right? If you look at NAND prices, they continue to make AFA a much more attractive value proposition than they were in the past, every quarter, and so if I were a customer, I would continue to prioritize AFA for all by transactional applications. The overall landscape for storage is dependent on the macro, and so I don't see the mix changing. I just look at the overall water level being determined by the macro. Listen, I think that our analysis leads us to draw the same conclusion, which is its two-third macro, one-third, yes we could have executed better. We did see some exposure from our \u2013 being concentrated in some of the larger accounts, right, and I think that that's consistent.  I want to just say that our leadership team, we wish all of the members of our leadership team well. We have the need to continue to add capacity. That's the fundamental area of focus for us. We'll continue to inspect our business and we'll provide you updates on our execution improvements over time. I'll just leave it there. No. I'll just say I think all of the calculations and factors we considered are you know in the public domain, right, and we use those factors to determine broad-based economic trajectories and then combine that with the judgment and the pipeline data of our sales teams and the historical linearity pattern of our business. We are not going to break that out. I would just say that the impact of what happened during the quarter was primarily due to the fact that some of our largest global accounts that we have very strategic relationships with, you know did not spend anywhere close to what they spent last year. I'll give you an example. We had two large customers that are exposed to the China tariff situation that have cut their capital spending by north of 30% year-on-year. Clearly we are a part of that spending profile and so I would just say that we have really good relationships with the big set of customers and we are planning to broaden those relationships to another broader set of customers over the course of the next year to 18 months. I think that you know what we mean when we say it's not a competitive factor is that our win rates in competitive transactions remains the same. Our product gross margins were up 280 basis points year-on-year when you adjust for ELAs, which shows the strength of our differentiation, right?  I think there may be differences in how the results play out for different providers depending on their customer basis. We did see exposure from our biggest customers not buying as much, right? And I think that what we are convinced off is that if we expand our footprint and broaden our customer coverage, given the strength of the performance we've had in the places where we saw you know budget available and our ability to win competitive transactions, we should be able to broaden our book of business and reduce the effects of customer concentration. I think first of all, what we said was it was reflective of Q1 results, Q1 FY '20 over Q1 FY '19 being down in the high teens, right?  I think with regard to the rest of the year, I'm not going to break out AFA versus HFA. I think that AFA is advantaged on a whole bunch of dimensions and should continue to get a bigger share of the pie of storage relative to HFA than it was in prior years, just because of NAND economics, QLC, all kinds of things.  I think we will continue to use every opportunity we can to drive transitions of disk-based systems and hybrid-based systems to our flash systems. The pace of those upgrades is a combination of, yes, good technology being available, but also budget cycles being available.  And so we're going to lean in on the technology side and give customers every opportunity to upgrade. But we'll have to wait to see how the macro plays out, to see how many of those budget cycles are available. Thanks, Kris. I'm disappointed in our weaker than expected top line results, but I remain confident that we have the right strategy and technology to address the key market transition. We have a strong business model, as a result of the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and cost structure over the last several years.  Our continued strong cash generation is a great example of the underlying health of our business. We will remain fiscally disciplined with our expenditures, while still investing for the long-term health of the business, and we remain committed to our capital allocation policy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and a quarterly dividend. The robust fundamentals of our business enable us to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and make the strategic moves that position us to return to growth.  I hope to see you at the Investors session of our Annual Insight User Conference on October 29 in Las Vegas. Thank you again."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to, Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nKris Newton: Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2022; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, and shareholder returns; and our ability to continue overall growth, gain market share, and scale our cloud business, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic; and the IT capital spending environment; as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, grow our cloud business, and generate greater cash flow. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K including in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections.

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I want to take a minute to acknowledge that it\u2019s been over a year that we have all been working remotely. I\u2019m encouraged by the public health and economic improvements in many parts of the world, but the recovery is uneven. As you know, we have a large team in India. Our thoughts are with them, as they deal with a distressing surge in COVID cases. Thank you to the entire NetApp team for your dedication, focus, and execution throughout this challenging year. Now to the results of the quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter results, capping off a solid year of growth. Our results were all above our Q4 guidance ranges. I am most excited by the return of product revenue to growth, the strength of our public cloud ARR, and an all-time high free cash flow. Our performance was broad-based, as certain verticals, the U.S., and parts of Europe and Asia are recovering faster than many expected. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives have been accelerated by the pandemic and companies look to NetApp to support these key initiatives. Going into FY21, we had two clear priorities: returning to growth in our storage business powered by share gains from our industry-leading file, block and object software and scaling our highly differentiated public cloud services business. As I reflect on the past year, I am proud of what we have achieved during a globally challenging period. We remained focused in executing our strategy and extending our innovation. In Q4, product revenue grew 6% and our all-flash array business grew 11% year-over-year. Based on our growth, I am confident that we have gained share in the storage and all-flash markets. We advanced our hybrid cloud portfolio with the introduction of ONTAP 9.9 and Astra. This innovation will support continued product revenue growth and share gains through fiscal year \u201822. Additionally, we continue to make good progress with Keystone, with many new wins, including our largest ever Keystone deal. We are reaching more customers than ever before with our public cloud business. Over the course of fiscal year \u201821, we added approximately 1,500 new-to-NetApp customers with public cloud services and grew our total cloud customer count by 137% from Q4 fiscal year \u201820. In addition to adding new cloud customers, existing cloud customers are expanding their spend with us. Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate increased to 252% in the fourth quarter. Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights, and Spot all performed well in the quarter, driving our public cloud services ARR to $301 million exiting fiscal year \u201821, an increase of 171% year-over-year. As we have said repeatedly, our cloud strategy strongly advantages NetApp. I\u2019ll use a customer example to illustrate how cloud helps us to acquire new customers and drive growth in our on-premises solutions. As a part of its digital transformation strategy, a leading car manufacturer decided to migrate workloads from its on-premises data centers to the Azure cloud. Despite never having used NetApp previously, the customer chose NetApp Cloud Volumes to host its file-based data and NetApp Cloud Sync to rapidly move data from its Dell EMC systems to the cloud. In addition to delivering a high-performance data store in the cloud, Cloud Volumes provides out-of-the box cross region replication of production data to a secondary cloud environment, high availability to meet the service level requirements of critical applications, and cost savings through automatic tiering to Azure Blob Storage. Because of the breadth and depth of the value NetApp delivered, the customer is now looking to deploy a hybrid cloud environment and plans to use NetApp on-premises, as well as increase its NetApp usage in the public cloud. As I noted earlier, the pandemic accelerated and elevated the importance of customers\u2019 cloud and digital transformation initiatives. We expect that this trend will be ongoing, and that NetApp will continue to benefit from it. Customers appreciate the value we bring as a cloud-led, data-centric software company to simplify and modernize existing data centers, to quickly and confidently deploy applications, and to securely manage data on the public cloud. We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise data management technology; our cloud solutions drive further differentiation, expand our addressable market, and enable us to reach new customers. We began our cloud journey seven years ago, with the introduction of Cloud ONTAP, now, Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Our initial focus was to leverage the cloud to deliver backup and disaster recovery services to our installed base. We saw that enterprises wanted to move workloads to the cloud. To address that need, we began working with the leading cloud providers to deliver Cloud Volumes Service, a fully managed service with the application certifications required to support mission-critical, production workloads in the cloud. We then recognized the opportunity to expand beyond storage management and optimization to infrastructure monitoring and compute management and optimization services, which led to the development of Cloud Insights and the acquisition of Spot. These services, Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights, and Spot, are now the primary growth engines of our public cloud services business. They are well established for enterprise applications, and we are taking each of them into the cloud native world, further expanding our market opportunity. NetApp Astra offers application-aware data management that protects, moves, and manages data-rich Kubernetes workloads. Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability while minimizing costs. Cloud Insights for Kubernetes provides simplified infrastructure monitoring to quickly identify performance issues and resource constraints. Together, our public cloud services give our customers, and especially their CloudOps and DevOps teams, a robust suite of multi-cloud infrastructure management services. We plan to press our advantage here by focusing our efforts on enhancing our go-to-market activities, deepening our cloud partnerships, and delivering best-in-class organic and inorganic innovations. We intend to leverage our deep infrastructure expertise and our credibility with the cloud providers to expand our multi-cloud infrastructure management services. My confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal year \u201825 is further enhanced by the strength and uniqueness of our cloud services position. Our focused execution last year has set us up well for fiscal year \u201822. We have returned to growth, we are gaining share in key storage markets, and our public cloud services are at a scale where they are positively impacting total company billings and revenue growth. Our momentum underscores our value to customers in a hybrid, multi-cloud world. In fiscal year \u201822, we plan to accelerate our public cloud services and continue to grow our hybrid cloud business. I am excited about the year ahead and confident in our ability to deliver top line growth by supporting our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys. Before I turn it over to Mike to walk through our financial results, I want to take a moment to thank Brad Anderson, who let us know that he intends to retire at the end of fiscal year \u201822. Brad has been instrumental in leading the maturation of our Hybrid Cloud Group, and we will continue to leverage his leadership and expertise this year. We are actively engaged in identifying his successor to ensure a smooth transition. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As we look back on what was an unprecedented year, I cannot help but be incredibly proud of the focus, execution, and commitment of the entire NetApp team. We delivered billings of $5.9 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, while revenue of $5.7 billion grew 6%. We delivered free cash flow of $1.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year, while continuing to aggressively invest in our public cloud franchise. We finished the year strong, with Q4 billings of $1.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year, while revenue of $1.6 billion was up 11% year-over-year. Both were solidly ahead of our expectations, driven by accelerating enterprise demand throughout the quarter. Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high-end of guidance. Q4 free cash flow of $521 million was an all-time high for NetApp. As George highlighted, public cloud ARR of $301 million was up 171% year-over-year and an impressive 27% sequentially. In fiscal \u201821, the scale of our cloud franchise really started to impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 4 of the 9 points in billings growth and 3 of the 6 points in revenue growth. In addition to the strong cloud ARR performance, we are excited that we exited the year with cloud gross margins near our overall corporate average. Given the growing impact on our total Company performance, we anticipate sharing more detail on our public cloud business in fiscal \u201822. When combined, software revenue, recurring support and cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 18% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. For the first time in company history, we ended Q4 with over $4 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth. Product revenue returned to growth in Q4, importantly, we expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal \u201822. Product revenue of $840 million increased 6% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we have seen throughout fiscal \u201821, software product revenue of $480 million dollars increased 18% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Recurring support and cloud revenue of $641 million was also an all-time Company high and was up 17% year-over-year, constituting 41% of total revenue. Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high-end of guidance. Product gross margin was 54.3% and benefited from the higher all-flash system mix. Our recurring support, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us, with gross margin of 82%. Operating margin of 23% was nicely ahead of our expectations, while EPS of $1.17 came in above the high end of guidance, despite a $0.05 headwind from a higher than forecasted tax-rate. Cash flow from operations was $559 million and free cash flow was $521 million, representing 34% of revenue. Cash flow came in higher than expected in part due to strong collections, as evidenced by the DSO metric of 55 days. Full-year fiscal \u201821 free cash flow of $1.2 billion was up 25% year-over-year and represented 20% of revenue. We closed Q4 with $4.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Given recent developments in the broader technology supply chain, I want to reiterate our confidence in our ability to meet end-demand as we head into Q1. We have an excellent supply chain team and they have been working closely with our partner ecosystem to ensure backlog and customer lead-times remain at normal levels throughout fiscal \u201822. Towards this goal, we will be investing incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments to help mitigate risk of supply shortages. Given our strong balance sheet and low cost of capital, we feel good about this investment. Now to guidance. In fiscal \u201822, we expect revenues to grow 6% to 7% year-over-year, with billings expected to outpace revenue given the continued strength in recurring support contracts and cloud services. In fiscal \u201822, we expect continued momentum and share gains in our cloud-connected all-flash portfolio. We will also continue to grow and invest in our diversified public cloud services portfolio. We are raising the low-end our fiscal \u201822 guide and now expect to exit fiscal \u201822 with public cloud ARR of $425 million to $500 million, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. Similar to the seasonal pattern we experienced in fiscal \u201821, we anticipate Q2 and Q4 to be our strongest quarters for net new public cloud ARR. This seasonal cadence is driven by our semi-annual sales compensation plans. As George noted, we have increased confidence in our ability to eclipse $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal \u201825. In fiscal \u201822, we expect gross margin to be roughly flat year-over-year at 67% to 68%, as improving cloud margins are balanced with strong demand for our hybrid cloud products. We anticipate operating margin to range between 21% and 22%, as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives, while delivering strong operating leverage. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be between $2.75 and $2.8 billion. The year-over-year increase in our expense base is being driven by continued investment in revenue generating activities, including expanding our cloud portfolio, targeted investments in sales resources and continued investment in our customer success sales team. Moving down the P&L, we expect interest expense to be $65 million to $70 million and our effective tax-rate to be approximately 19%. While we get a bit of delevering below the operating income line, as a result of the higher interest expense and tax rate, we are committed to delivering $4.45 to $4.65 in fiscal \u201822 EPS, representing 12% year-over-year growth, at the mid-point. We expect to again generate over $1.1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal \u201822, as our hybrid cloud business continues to fund the growth in our cloud services franchise. Factored into the year-over-year free cash flow generation is a step-up in CapEx to $225 million to $235 million. Our public cloud partners, in particular Azure, are driving us hard to build out additional global capacity for our cloud offerings. Even with this added investment, we expect cloud gross margins to become accretive to our corporate average as we move through fiscal \u201822. Generating over $1.1 billion in free cash will allow us to continue to deliver on our capital allocation commitments, while also investing in our key strategic areas. The dividend will remain the first call on capital. As you saw today, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. Share repurchases will also continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. Towards this goal our Board approved an additional $500 million in buyback authorization. In fiscal \u201822, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, we expect share count to remain flat at 229 million shares, exiting fiscal \u201822. Consistent with NetApp\u2019s long history of disciplined M&A, the remaining 30% of free cash generation will go towards our acquisition strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic cloud services roadmap. Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.37 billion and $1.47 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase in revenues year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 68% and operating margin to range between 19% and 20%. Assumed in this guidance are Q1 operating expenses of $680 million to $690 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 19%. And we expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $0.89 and $0.97 per share. Assumed in our Q1 guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million. In closing, I want to thank our partners, customers and investors for their unwavering support this past year. And most importantly, a huge shout out to the entire NetApp employee base for redefining what it means to work as a team, during what was a challenging year in so many ways. We are more confident than ever in our ability to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead. I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Let\u2019s open the call for Q&A. Please keep to just one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the nice strength. I was hoping if you could just talk a little bit more on the cloud data services business. And I guess, a, I would love to understand sort of what really drove the upside in the quarter versus the $260 million to $290 million guide that you already had out there? And then, really, when I think about the full year number you provided of $425 million to $500 million, the low end, I think, is ticking up by $20 million -- $25 million. What is driving the confidence in this business as you go into next year? And how important is it for you to scale beyond Azure to achieve the fiscal year targets laid out?\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you for the question. We have been working on multiple innovation parts of our portfolio, all of which performed extremely strongly. Cloud Volumes for storage; Cloud Insights for monitoring; Spot for compute management, all had really strong Q4s and overall, really strong years. We saw good expansion in the number of customers and strong growth in the number of new-to-NetApp customers. We saw customers spending against their digital transformation and their cloud programs throughout the quarter. So, it was a smooth trajectory through the quarter. And I think that sets us up well for next year. I think, if you look at our dollar-based net retention rate, you can see that our organic business grew strongly this year, and we had about $60 million of this year being inorganic from acquisitions of Spot, Talon and CloudJumper. So, when you back that out, we expect next year\u2019s growth rate to also continue the acceleration of our organic portfolio and continued strength of our inorganic portfolio. We have a really good and differentiated portfolio of services. We have deep partnerships and are expanding the range of things we do with the hyperscalers. And we are growing our customer base of people who are doing many business-critical projects on the public clouds with us. So, I\u2019m really excited with every confidence. We\u2019ll tell you more about our cloud business, as Mike indicated, as we go through the year, giving you more details on it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.\nRod Hall: I\u2019m going to do the old question and clarification thing, if I can. The question is on ARR and what the ceiling on that is. Obviously, you\u2019ve done really well there. And I\u2019m curious if you could George, maybe just give us some idea of what the -- what do you think the headroom is there? Because clearly, there\u2019s a lot of growth coming through. And then, the clarification just on the EPS calculations for the full year guide. We\u2019re getting a number lower than the range you guys are giving. So, I\u2019m not sure if using all the inputs you\u2019re talking about, we get something like $4.41. So, I\u2019m not sure, if you add all that up, why we would be ending up at a different place than maybe your guide is. So, I don\u2019t know, Mike or if you could clarify that, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Rod. With regard to the cloud portfolio, listen, I think the heavy lift in terms of getting the innovation portfolio to be in really good shape is behind us. I think, we have, as I said, three really strong innovation engines, and we are bringing out cloud-native innovations across those lineups as well through the course of the summer. We are making investments, as we indicated last quarter, to accelerate and expand the range of things we\u2019re doing in the cloud portfolio. With regard to what\u2019s it going to take to further accelerate the course of the business, it\u2019s all the things that we\u2019re doing, right? We\u2019re expanding the number of sellers and revenue-generating teams facing customers. We\u2019ve seen really good success with Microsoft in terms of their route to market. We\u2019re working with the other hyperscalers to also train and expand the range of ways we take our products to market with them. And we\u2019re building our customer service and customer success teams. I feel even more confident that we have the range of capabilities to achieve the $1 billion target in ARR that we indicated. And the customer use cases that we are deploying on our public cloud portfolios, these are run the business applications, mission-critical, highly differentiated business value-creating application. So, I feel really, really good about where we are at the year. Mike, do you want to take the other part of the question?\nMike Berry: Sure. Thanks, George. Hey, Rod. So, I just want to make sure -- we could go through it separately with you and the team. We want to make sure that hey, the gross interest is not the net interest. It could be in the OIE calculation as well, so. And there\u2019s a lot of sensitivity, obviously, to that count. So, it\u2019s probably below operating income that it\u2019s a little bit different in our model. We\u2019re happy to walk you through that separately.\nRod Hall: Mike, just for the call, could you maybe say what that OI&E number is? Then people can just plug that in.\nMike Berry: Yes. So, we said 65 to 70 for the interest. For the OIE that we have in there is -- yes, that\u2019s the interest, that\u2019s what we did on the -- in my script. And as you know, that number jumps around quite a bit. There\u2019s more than just obviously, interest in that OIE number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. And congratulations on the quarter, clearly confident in kind of how the story is progressing. I know you touched on this in your prepared remarks a little bit. But, I just wanted to go back to kind of the component environment. There\u2019s a lot of discussion out there around SSDs and some controller constraints, and pricing moving upward on flash and SSDs in general. Just help us maybe appreciate the confidence that you have in component supply and how you\u2019re reacting to any kind of inflationary pricing dynamic? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Sure. Hey Aaron, it\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. So, we have certainly contemplated the challenges in the supply chain when providing our gross margin guidance for Q1 and fiscal \u201822. Supply chain teams, they\u2019ve really performed well all year long, working closely with our suppliers. And we have confidence we can continue that performance this coming year. As you know, we\u2019re a cloud world software company. Our product margins, we expect to continue to benefit from the higher-margin software-rich configurations. And we continue to do a lot of hard work on the services margin. As we talked about, cloud margins should continue to improve as we go through the year, as well as you\u2019ll see the benefits of the consumption of the deployed system and more increase in our Software-as-a-Service. There\u2019s always unforeseen circumstances that may come into play. But as we sit here today, we feel good about it. And, when you talk about total -- our total component cost, we expect it to be a little bit of a tailwind in the first half. And then, based on prices that we have today and you know as well as those things change, potentially a little bit of a headwind in the second half when we take that into our guidance.\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to our technology portfolio, as Mike said, we have a range of configurations that we can support our customers with all the way from 900 gigs to 16 terabytes. And so, we have plenty of capability to given the flexibility in our software operating system to qualify the right components to meet customer needs and support them. With regard to the demand environment and gross margins, listen, as Mike said, we\u2019ve operated through a tough year and done a really good job. I think that you\u2019ll see us continue to remain prudent, balancing end-user demand with margin management as we go through the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.\nNik Todorov: Yes. Thanks, and congrats from me as well on the great results. George, I do appreciate the full year guide. I\u2019m just wondering if we can double click maybe on the revenue outlook, 6% to 7% growth. Can you give some more color around the assumptions there? Maybe if you can talk how much of that comes from share gains versus the market or any breakdown between the drivers of product or CDS or software? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Okay. Listen, as we go through the year, we see a continuing improvement in public health and the overall demand environment. We have been benefiting from cloud and digital transformation projects through the course of the year. We have not seen any major -- so we don\u2019t see some unique snapback or something like that in government spending or in enterprise spending. We see us benefiting from long-term trends and projects that are strategic to customers. We see more countries, especially the U.S. and parts of Western Europe come on line in a more significant way through the course of our fiscal year, the U.S. more likely in the first part of the fiscal year, Europe coming on line more strongly in the second half of our fiscal year. We have every confidence that our product portfolio is differentiated, and we\u2019ll continue to see product revenue grow faster than services revenue and the strength of our cloud portfolio. We have a much bigger base of customers now in the cloud business. We have a much broader range of application certifications that we entered last year. And so, we feel really, really good about the year ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.\nMatt Cabral: Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you can give an update on the ramp of the 200 quota-bearing heads that you\u2019ve added over the past, I think it was 18 months or so. Just where they are in their ramps relative to full productivity? And as we\u2019re heading into fiscal \u201822, just how you\u2019re thinking about investments in sales capacity for the next fiscal year and beyond?\nGeorge Kurian: I think, as we said, the typical sales productivity ramp happens over the course of four quarters. We are -- the 200 reps that we started adding in fiscal year \u201820 are fully productive. They\u2019re part of NetApp teams. You saw some of the benefits from their performance and additions to our teams, particularly in the Americas business, which was really strong, and it sets us up well for what we think will be a strong American recovery over the course of the next 12 months. With regard to continued additions, as Mike has said and what we have said before, we continue to be prudent about where we add those teams. We will do so where we see demand and environments being strong. And we\u2019ll tell you more about the course of that. We added some headcount in our customer success teams and in our cloud teams this past quarter. You should anticipate us continuing to do that to support the growth of the cloud portfolio. But, Mike, if you want to add any other color?\nMike Berry: Yes. Thanks, George. So, I would just underline the additions that we talked about last quarter and this quarter as well into specific areas around cloud, and then the customer success team which is, as you all know, in a cloud business super important in terms of upsell, cross-sell renewals. So, we do continue to make investments there. And I think you\u2019ve seen some of the results in the ARR results this quarter.\nOperator: Next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Public cloud profitability is ramping faster alongside the better revenue performance. Is that purely due to revenue scale, or have you tuned the business model in any way to capture cost efficiencies? And then, Mike, just as a follow-up to that, can you clarify whether we should expect cloud margins for the full year 2022 to be dilutive, neutral or accretive to the model? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Sure. Thanks for the question, Katy. Let me do the last one first. So, we said, as we go through the year, we expected cloud margins to be accretive to the total Company average. So, as we get through the year and certainly ending the year. And then, yes, we have seen a much bigger increase in our cloud margins than we had originally expected. Certainly, scale -- revenue scale matters. I would also give a lot of kudos to the team, though, for being really efficient in terms of how they use not only the hardware, but also all this stuff that goes to support those businesses as it relates to people and process. So, it\u2019s all of the above. But certainly, growth in ARR is the key driver followed next by a really good job by that team in terms of managing the margins.\nGeorge Kurian: Katy, I think we have many avenues as we have described to continue to drive the gross margins in our cloud business. There\u2019s a growing portfolio of software-only offerings in the cloud business. Spot, Cloud Insights, several versions of our Cloud Volumes offerings are all software. We -- Mike mentioned the hardware utilization. We have brought out new versions of our ONTAP operating systems that continue to be more efficient in terms of data management and storage efficiency. And so, we feel very good about our path to continuing to improve cloud gross margins in the direction that Mike articulated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: You noted some seasonality in Cloud ARR through the course of the year where Q2, Q4 are typically higher. I was wondering, is it -- would it be accurate to think that the net organic growth sequentially should be at least at a higher level relative to last year, even though we look at some -- maybe some seasonality going into Q1? And can you give us any color on these cloud deals, how much of those were NAV generated versus partner generated? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Yes. So, on the organic growth, Wamsi, what I -- this is Mike, by the way. I would point you to the dollar-based net retention number. And as you saw in the quarter, it actually accelerated quarter-over-quarter. So, you can assume, if you take a look at that the organic business is doing -- call it, the organic business is doing very, very well. And as George talked about, a lot of those offerings are -- is that organic business. And we don\u2019t break out the contributions from the hyperscalers versus the core business or the NetApp business. What I would say is a lot of the seasonal pickup that you see in Q2 and Q4 is driven by our sales teams, in addition, obviously, with the hyperscalers. And I just want to underline that, please, which is, hey, when you guys do your models for next year, please make sure that you take that seasonality into account. Don\u2019t just take the increase in ARR and divide by 4. There is absolutely seasonality in that business as you\u2019ve seen in the last two years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: George, I was just wondering, when I listened to everything that you said, you talked about improving market share. It sounds like a better mix as you go through the year. You had accelerating digital transformation engagements during the quarter and into this quarter. And then, when I look at the full year guidance, it seems to imply when I look at the market, you\u2019re expecting some sort of deceleration as you go up throughout the year, even when I take into account some of the tougher comparisons. Am I thinking about that conservatism right, or is there anything else you would say on the markets? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Listen, I think when we look at the full year guidance for next year, we\u2019ve guided 6% to 7% in terms of revenue growth. I think that what you see from us is real confidence in the business. The second half of the year is on a compare basis compared to a stronger second half this year as enterprise spending came back on line through COVID, right? So, it isn\u2019t an expectation of us having a deceleration in terms of our ability to grow cloud or gain share. It\u2019s just a kind of a realization that the second half of this year is a stronger compare than the first half of this year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva: Thank you. My question and it\u2019s kind of a clarification, but also related forward-looking is, can you clarify for this quarter, how much of the revenues were organic versus acquisition? And then, the outlook, George, I know you mentioned $1 billion run rate. Is that based upon all organic? I assume that\u2019s the case. But I just wanted to clarify because I think Mike mentioned about 30% of cash flow could be used for M&A. But I just kind of want to clarify organic versus M&A as you sit today, reported and as you look out. And again, congratulations on the great results and outlook.\nMike Berry: Hey Jim, it\u2019s Mike. On the first one from the organic contribution of revenue, it was very small. It was less than 0.5 percentage point of growth. It was really not much at all in terms of -- but keep in mind that that is related to the cloud acquisitions earlier in the year, not much of an impact at all. And in the quarter, it was very little.\nGeorge Kurian: Hey, I think, Jim, when we look at the business, we feel very good about our portfolio capabilities that we have today getting us to that $1 billion ARR number in fiscal year \u201825. We\u2019re not going to break out organic versus inorganic. I think, we feel that we\u2019ve achieved a full year of integration of our core acquisitions, Spot, CloudJumper and Talon. So, we feel that the core bets are in place for this year. We will continue to look at inorganic acquisitions to fill out our portfolio, right? So, we think that we have a strong start to differentiated position in the cloud market. We feel really strong about the capabilities that we have. We will tell you more about it through the course of the business, through the course of -- as we expand the cloud business. And I\u2019ll just sit on three things, right? We are growing our cloud business while growing our core business. We are acquiring a lot of net new customers. We are accelerating our organic business growth and our inorganic acquisitions. And so, I feel really, really good about our business overall. Cloud gross margins, as Mike said, are near the corporate average, and as we go through next year, will be accretive to company gross margins. So, I just feel very, very good about our opportunity in the cloud and the work that our team has been doing with the cloud providers. And we\u2019re going to double down on it.\nJim Suva: Congratulations.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Jim. Next question?\nOperator: Next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I had a question on cash flow. I understand that you guided to over $1.1 billion and this fiscal 2022 is going to have pressure from inventory and higher CapEx. But, as you think about the model on a longer term basis, should we expect that when you don\u2019t have to buy excess inventory, we\u2019ll start to see cash flow growth that maybe more closely mirrors what you\u2019re able to do in terms of earnings, or will the increased CapEx be a drag for a longer period of time? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Hey Shannon, it\u2019s Mike. So, thanks for the question on cash flow, happy to do that. So, a couple of things. If you look over the last four years, the operating cash flow results in NetApp have really mirrored the operating -- non-GAAP operating income. It\u2019s like 107% of that number. So, we do expect over time that we\u2019ll see operating cash flow mirror operating income we\u2019ll see operating cash flow mere operating income growth. Now there\u2019s -- it\u2019s going to bumper on a little bit, and I\u2019m going to do operating and then I\u2019ll take you to free cash flow. Next year, for instance, in fiscal \u201822, we would expect to see operating cash flow growth be a little bit more than earnings, just because of the working capital impact of some of the expenses in \u201821, and we\u2019ve put that in the script. From a free cash flow perspective, we really look at next year CapEx as hopefully the high watermark. A couple of pieces there. One is the -- we are certainly continuing to install hardware and some of the data centers to support the cloud business. As George talked about, we\u2019re super excited about some of the software options there as well. And as we have more software defined, that will help. Also next year in that number, there\u2019s about $50 million in CapEx related to two facilities projects, related to our Wichita site and to a lesser extent, our new building in San Jose. We obviously have a little bit of facilities CapEx, but that\u2019s a big number next year. That\u2019s why we feel comfortable going forward that we can have CapEx below the $200 million that I discussed in the script. So I just want to walk you through those puts and takes. But over time, yes, I do expect operating cash flow to pretty much near operating income with some bumping around every year largely due to working capital.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, guys. Yes. Congrats on the strong results. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, just going back, so George and Mike, to new sales force. Is there any -- I guess, is sort of the go-forward on that -- the incremental, is there anything meaningfully incremental that collectively those add initiatives can contribute? And not just with regard -- I mean, I know the 200 were sort of across the portfolio. So, I\u2019m really thinking in totality, not just on the cloud side, but also on the new customer side and with regards to how you were repositioning the go-to customer from a solution perspective? And that\u2019s it. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think, we\u2019ll continue to be careful about where we add sales teams. I think, we constantly rebalance to areas of opportunity, both in terms of the composition of the sales force and the locations where we put the headcount. I think, as I\u2019ve said before, the recovery will be at different rates in different geographies. And I think as the public data indicates, the Americas is the place where we expect the recovery to be more pronounced this coming year, Europe lagging 6 to 9 months thereafter, and the rest of the developing economies maybe 6 to 9 months after that. So, we\u2019ll prioritize any additions in accordance with how we see the end user demand. With cloud, we have been adding, step-wise. I think one of the important things that we\u2019re focused on this year is to get our frontline sales teams to be balanced with selling cloud and our systems in customers\u2019 data centers. And so, I feel like, listen, we\u2019re not going to have a stepwise addition in our investment. We\u2019ll do it as the business comes. And we feel very good about the disciplined approach we\u2019ve taken and the payoffs for those investments in fairly short order.\nAnanda Baruah: And George, are the current adds -- or the adds so far, are they fully optimized at this point?\nGeorge Kurian: I think on the 200 heads, as we\u2019ve said, they are fully productive, fully part of the NetApp sales team. We are adding some -- we added some cloud headcount in last quarter, we anticipate to add some more this year. Alongside the course of the business, they will take some time to get productive, but those are in the same range of productivity ramps as our traditional sales headcount. I think, what you see from this coming year from our guidance to the coming year is that revenue outpaces the growth in operating expense, leading to additional leverage in our business model. That reflects our disciplined approach to investing where we see the opportunities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with FIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: I joined the call late. So, I apologize if I\u2019m repeating the question. I noticed your inventories are at a two-year low. And I want to see what\u2019s your strategy and how aggressive are you going to be out there buying key components, especially storage? And I have a quick follow-up.\nMike Berry: Sure. Hey Mehdi, it\u2019s Mike. So, yes, we had very good inventory turns at the end of Q4. As I mentioned in the script, we -- and we\u2019ve already started and we will expect to continue a couple of different programs. One is to double down on some of the key components related to our storage products to make sure that we have enough resources. We\u2019ve always done that. And we will continue to do that. We will also add some safety stocks, so that if there are issues throughout the world, and hopefully, we\u2019re able to respond to that. In addition, we\u2019ve also -- will have longer, I\u2019ll call it, purchase orders that we will extend through the year. So, we\u2019re doing everything that we can to make sure that we have enough inventory. I would expect, in Q1, you should see those turns probably go back to the 12 to 14 number. And again, given lower cost of capital, our goal to make sure that we always have product and we could meet customer requirements, we think that\u2019s a very good investment. So, thanks for the question. Yes, you should see those inventories increase and the inventory turns go down in Q1 and likely through the rest of fiscal \u201822.\nMehdi Hosseini: Great. And just a quick follow-up. Your cloud services margins is becoming accretive. But is that higher cost of component that is capping the gross margin?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think with regard to component costs, as Mike said, as we look out the next year, we see that the component cost in aggregate for the full year is going to be relatively flat to this year with some puts and takes in terms of the mix. I think that with regard to cloud gross margins, it\u2019s really reflecting the balance of certain regions getting more heavily utilized and seeing customer consumption of the installed footprint, while we make investments in other regions to continue to expand our business. And that trade-off between investing to continue to expand the business with the growth in ARR is the balance we walk. I think as I also mentioned, we have several other avenues to continue to drive gross margins in cloud. The software mix in the portfolio is growing with solutions like Spot and Cloud Insights and some versions of our Cloud Volumes products being software-only. The second is we continue to drive efficiency in the software, in ONTAP operating system software. So, there are lots of avenues to continue to accelerate cloud gross margins. Team has done a good job this year. And we expect it to be accretive to company gross margins as we go through next fiscal year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Maybe one more question on gross margin. In the past, you talked about a target to get product gross margin back to the mid-50s. You are at 54 and change already this quarter. Should we expect this gross margin to continue to improve over the next few quarters, given the mix shift towards the software heavy side products, or should we think about hardware and software margins both still have room to grow? And it sounds like higher component costs may not have an impact in the near term, but I just want to confirm that. Thanks.\nMike Berry: Yes. Hey Sidney, it\u2019s Mike. We have guided in our fiscal \u201821 in our Q1 numbers, product gross margins to be relatively consistent with how we exited Q4. Again, component costs over the full year, at this point, as we sit here today, relatively flat. It will move on a little bit by quarter, but keep in mind as well, mix matters a lot in that as well. Also in Q1, we talked about 68% gross margins. Keep in mind that there\u2019s a much bigger component of revenue in Q1 that\u2019s services versus product. So you also get that bump in margin. You saw that in the last couple of Q1s as well. So, as we sit here today, we don\u2019t see a lot of movement in the gross margin numbers. Again that\u2019s based on the component costs that we see today. Mix does matter in the quarter, but we\u2019ve largely stayed relatively consistent with how we\u2019re exiting Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets.\nNehal Chokshi: Thank you. And congrats on a great quarter and great guidance. And also, thank you for the providing the extra visibility in PCS in terms of profitability with the gross margin comment, which is actually quite impressive about the scale. But, I always want more. So, my question here is, what about the operating income profitability of the PCS division? And/or maybe you can comment on where on the Rule of 40 is PCS operating at right now?\nMike Berry: So, I want to make sure I understand the question. You\u2019re not talking about gross margins. You\u2019re talking about operating margins, Nehal?\nNehal Chokshi: Correct, correct. And then, maybe if you want to put that into the context of Rule of 40?\nMike Berry: Yes. So, at this point, as you said, you always want more. We feel good about talking about our gross margins. We\u2019re not going to go down to operating margins in that business that gets into a lot of allocations and things. So, what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to focus the business on gross margin. Do we certainly look at OpEx? And where we spend the money? Yes, we do. So, in terms of the Rule of 40, again, we have to go down the operating income. We won\u2019t do that. We will keep it at the gross margin discussion.\nNehal Chokshi: In the future, do you expect to be able to break this out, or do you expect that the -- there\u2019s just too much cross-selling going on that would prevent that kind of breakout to happen?\nMike Berry: What I would say is, hey, tune in after the Q1 call, and we\u2019ll talk about what we\u2019re going to disclose going in \u201822.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. Your latest run rate all-flash array revenues are near a record of $2.9 billion and your year-over-year growth exceeded most peers. And so, I was hoping you could provide some parameters, at least qualitatively, around your fiscal \u201822 expectations for all-flash array growth, and maybe how the mix of your installed base plays into those expectations? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I feel really good about our flash business. We are focused, differentiated and executing in the market. I think, our strong position in the sweet spot of the storage industry, which is the midrange part of the market, is clearly evident, and it is affecting the growth rates of our competitors. We have taken share for the last several quarters, and we see every confidence that we will continue to do that going forward. What we said at the Analyst Day was that over the next few years, the all-flash array market will grow at about 7.5% CAGR, and we expect to outpace that this coming year. We expect that the storage industry will grow around 4%, and our revenue picture expects us to outpace the growth of the storage industry overall. So, we feel really good. And ONTAP 9.9 coming out gives us even more confidence in our differentiation.\nKris Newton: All right. Well, thank you, Karl. That\u2019s our final question. So, I\u2019ll hand it over to George for some closing remarks.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. In closing, we delivered a great end to a strong year. And we are well-positioned as we move into fiscal year \u201822. I want to reiterate that our public cloud business is at a scale where it is contributing meaningfully to revenue and billings growth. And the innovations we deliver to our hybrid cloud business will support continued product revenue growth. In fiscal year \u201822, we expect to grow the top line, deliver operating leverage and generate significant free cash flow, all while investing in growth initiatives. I am excited by and confident in our ability to capitalize on the industry transitions and the market opportunities ahead. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you for joining us. And a special thank you to our NetApp team.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As we look back on what was an unprecedented year, I cannot help but be incredibly proud of the focus, execution, and commitment of the entire NetApp team. We delivered billings of $5.9 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, while revenue of $5.7 billion grew 6%. We delivered free cash flow of $1.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year, while continuing to aggressively invest in our public cloud franchise. We finished the year strong, with Q4 billings of $1.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year, while revenue of $1.6 billion was up 11% year-over-year. Both were solidly ahead of our expectations, driven by accelerating enterprise demand throughout the quarter. Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high-end of guidance. Q4 free cash flow of $521 million was an all-time high for NetApp. As George highlighted, public cloud ARR of $301 million was up 171% year-over-year and an impressive 27% sequentially. In fiscal \u201821, the scale of our cloud franchise really started to impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 4 of the 9 points in billings growth and 3 of the 6 points in revenue growth. In addition to the strong cloud ARR performance, we are excited that we exited the year with cloud gross margins near our overall corporate average. Given the growing impact on our total Company performance, we anticipate sharing more detail on our public cloud business in fiscal \u201822. When combined, software revenue, recurring support and cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 18% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. For the first time in company history, we ended Q4 with over $4 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth. Product revenue returned to growth in Q4, importantly, we expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal \u201822. Product revenue of $840 million increased 6% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we have seen throughout fiscal \u201821, software product revenue of $480 million dollars increased 18% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Recurring support and cloud revenue of $641 million was also an all-time Company high and was up 17% year-over-year, constituting 41% of total revenue. Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high-end of guidance. Product gross margin was 54.3% and benefited from the higher all-flash system mix. Our recurring support, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us, with gross margin of 82%. Operating margin of 23% was nicely ahead of our expectations, while EPS of $1.17 came in above the high end of guidance, despite a $0.05 headwind from a higher than forecasted tax-rate. Cash flow from operations was $559 million and free cash flow was $521 million, representing 34% of revenue. Cash flow came in higher than expected in part due to strong collections, as evidenced by the DSO metric of 55 days. Full-year fiscal \u201821 free cash flow of $1.2 billion was up 25% year-over-year and represented 20% of revenue. We closed Q4 with $4.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Given recent developments in the broader technology supply chain, I want to reiterate our confidence in our ability to meet end-demand as we head into Q1. We have an excellent supply chain team and they have been working closely with our partner ecosystem to ensure backlog and customer lead-times remain at normal levels throughout fiscal \u201822. Towards this goal, we will be investing incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments to help mitigate risk of supply shortages. Given our strong balance sheet and low cost of capital, we feel good about this investment. Now to guidance. In fiscal \u201822, we expect revenues to grow 6% to 7% year-over-year, with billings expected to outpace revenue given the continued strength in recurring support contracts and cloud services. In fiscal \u201822, we expect continued momentum and share gains in our cloud-connected all-flash portfolio. We will also continue to grow and invest in our diversified public cloud services portfolio. We are raising the low-end our fiscal \u201822 guide and now expect to exit fiscal \u201822 with public cloud ARR of $425 million to $500 million, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. Similar to the seasonal pattern we experienced in fiscal \u201821, we anticipate Q2 and Q4 to be our strongest quarters for net new public cloud ARR. This seasonal cadence is driven by our semi-annual sales compensation plans. As George noted, we have increased confidence in our ability to eclipse $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal \u201825. In fiscal \u201822, we expect gross margin to be roughly flat year-over-year at 67% to 68%, as improving cloud margins are balanced with strong demand for our hybrid cloud products. We anticipate operating margin to range between 21% and 22%, as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives, while delivering strong operating leverage. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be between $2.75 and $2.8 billion. The year-over-year increase in our expense base is being driven by continued investment in revenue generating activities, including expanding our cloud portfolio, targeted investments in sales resources and continued investment in our customer success sales team. Moving down the P&L, we expect interest expense to be $65 million to $70 million and our effective tax-rate to be approximately 19%. While we get a bit of delevering below the operating income line, as a result of the higher interest expense and tax rate, we are committed to delivering $4.45 to $4.65 in fiscal \u201822 EPS, representing 12% year-over-year growth, at the mid-point. We expect to again generate over $1.1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal \u201822, as our hybrid cloud business continues to fund the growth in our cloud services franchise. Factored into the year-over-year free cash flow generation is a step-up in CapEx to $225 million to $235 million. Our public cloud partners, in particular Azure, are driving us hard to build out additional global capacity for our cloud offerings. Even with this added investment, we expect cloud gross margins to become accretive to our corporate average as we move through fiscal \u201822. Generating over $1.1 billion in free cash will allow us to continue to deliver on our capital allocation commitments, while also investing in our key strategic areas. The dividend will remain the first call on capital. As you saw today, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. Share repurchases will also continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. Towards this goal our Board approved an additional $500 million in buyback authorization. In fiscal \u201822, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, we expect share count to remain flat at 229 million shares, exiting fiscal \u201822. Consistent with NetApp's long history of disciplined M&A, the remaining 30% of free cash generation will go towards our acquisition strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic cloud services roadmap. Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.37 billion and $1.47 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase in revenues year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 68% and operating margin to range between 19% and 20%. Assumed in this guidance are Q1 operating expenses of $680 million to $690 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 19%. And we expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $0.89 and $0.97 per share. Assumed in our Q1 guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million. In closing, I want to thank our partners, customers and investors for their unwavering support this past year. And most importantly, a huge shout out to the entire NetApp employee base for redefining what it means to work as a team, during what was a challenging year in so many ways. We are more confident than ever in our ability to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Sure. Thanks, George. Hey, Rod. So, I just want to make sure -- we could go through it separately with you and the team. We want to make sure that hey, the gross interest is not the net interest. It could be in the OIE calculation as well, so. And there's a lot of sensitivity, obviously, to that count. So, it's probably below operating income that it's a little bit different in our model. We're happy to walk you through that separately. Yes. So, we said 65 to 70 for the interest. For the OIE that we have in there is -- yes, that's the interest, that's what we did on the -- in my script. And as you know, that number jumps around quite a bit. There's more than just obviously, interest in that OIE number. Sure. Hey Aaron, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So, we have certainly contemplated the challenges in the supply chain when providing our gross margin guidance for Q1 and fiscal \u201822. Supply chain teams, they've really performed well all year long, working closely with our suppliers. And we have confidence we can continue that performance this coming year. As you know, we're a cloud world software company. Our product margins, we expect to continue to benefit from the higher-margin software-rich configurations. And we continue to do a lot of hard work on the services margin. As we talked about, cloud margins should continue to improve as we go through the year, as well as you'll see the benefits of the consumption of the deployed system and more increase in our Software-as-a-Service. There's always unforeseen circumstances that may come into play. But as we sit here today, we feel good about it. And, when you talk about total -- our total component cost, we expect it to be a little bit of a tailwind in the first half. And then, based on prices that we have today and you know as well as those things change, potentially a little bit of a headwind in the second half when we take that into our guidance. Yes. Thanks, George. So, I would just underline the additions that we talked about last quarter and this quarter as well into specific areas around cloud, and then the customer success team which is, as you all know, in a cloud business super important in terms of upsell, cross-sell renewals. So, we do continue to make investments there. And I think you've seen some of the results in the ARR results this quarter. Sure. Thanks for the question, Katy. Let me do the last one first. So, we said, as we go through the year, we expected cloud margins to be accretive to the total Company average. So, as we get through the year and certainly ending the year. And then, yes, we have seen a much bigger increase in our cloud margins than we had originally expected. Certainly, scale -- revenue scale matters. I would also give a lot of kudos to the team, though, for being really efficient in terms of how they use not only the hardware, but also all this stuff that goes to support those businesses as it relates to people and process. So, it's all of the above. But certainly, growth in ARR is the key driver followed next by a really good job by that team in terms of managing the margins. Yes. So, on the organic growth, Wamsi, what I -- this is Mike, by the way. I would point you to the dollar-based net retention number. And as you saw in the quarter, it actually accelerated quarter-over-quarter. So, you can assume, if you take a look at that the organic business is doing -- call it, the organic business is doing very, very well. And as George talked about, a lot of those offerings are -- is that organic business. And we don't break out the contributions from the hyperscalers versus the core business or the NetApp business. What I would say is a lot of the seasonal pickup that you see in Q2 and Q4 is driven by our sales teams, in addition, obviously, with the hyperscalers. And I just want to underline that, please, which is, hey, when you guys do your models for next year, please make sure that you take that seasonality into account. Don't just take the increase in ARR and divide by 4. There is absolutely seasonality in that business as you've seen in the last two years. Listen, I think when we look at the full year guidance for next year, we've guided 6% to 7% in terms of revenue growth. I think that what you see from us is real confidence in the business. The second half of the year is on a compare basis compared to a stronger second half this year as enterprise spending came back on line through COVID, right? So, it isn't an expectation of us having a deceleration in terms of our ability to grow cloud or gain share. It's just a kind of a realization that the second half of this year is a stronger compare than the first half of this year. Hey Jim, it's Mike. On the first one from the organic contribution of revenue, it was very small. It was less than 0.5 percentage point of growth. It was really not much at all in terms of -- but keep in mind that that is related to the cloud acquisitions earlier in the year, not much of an impact at all. And in the quarter, it was very little. Hey Shannon, it's Mike. So, thanks for the question on cash flow, happy to do that. So, a couple of things. If you look over the last four years, the operating cash flow results in NetApp have really mirrored the operating -- non-GAAP operating income. It's like 107% of that number. So, we do expect over time that we'll see operating cash flow mirror operating income we'll see operating cash flow mere operating income growth. Now there's -- it's going to bumper on a little bit, and I'm going to do operating and then I'll take you to free cash flow. Next year, for instance, in fiscal \u201822, we would expect to see operating cash flow growth be a little bit more than earnings, just because of the working capital impact of some of the expenses in \u201821, and we've put that in the script. From a free cash flow perspective, we really look at next year CapEx as hopefully the high watermark. A couple of pieces there. One is the -- we are certainly continuing to install hardware and some of the data centers to support the cloud business. As George talked about, we're super excited about some of the software options there as well. And as we have more software defined, that will help. Also next year in that number, there's about $50 million in CapEx related to two facilities projects, related to our Wichita site and to a lesser extent, our new building in San Jose. We obviously have a little bit of facilities CapEx, but that's a big number next year. That's why we feel comfortable going forward that we can have CapEx below the $200 million that I discussed in the script. So I just want to walk you through those puts and takes. But over time, yes, I do expect operating cash flow to pretty much near operating income with some bumping around every year largely due to working capital. Sure. Hey Mehdi, it's Mike. So, yes, we had very good inventory turns at the end of Q4. As I mentioned in the script, we -- and we've already started and we will expect to continue a couple of different programs. One is to double down on some of the key components related to our storage products to make sure that we have enough resources. We've always done that. And we will continue to do that. We will also add some safety stocks, so that if there are issues throughout the world, and hopefully, we're able to respond to that. In addition, we've also -- will have longer, I'll call it, purchase orders that we will extend through the year. So, we're doing everything that we can to make sure that we have enough inventory. I would expect, in Q1, you should see those turns probably go back to the 12 to 14 number. And again, given lower cost of capital, our goal to make sure that we always have product and we could meet customer requirements, we think that's a very good investment. So, thanks for the question. Yes, you should see those inventories increase and the inventory turns go down in Q1 and likely through the rest of fiscal \u201822. Yes. Hey Sidney, it's Mike. We have guided in our fiscal \u201821 in our Q1 numbers, product gross margins to be relatively consistent with how we exited Q4. Again, component costs over the full year, at this point, as we sit here today, relatively flat. It will move on a little bit by quarter, but keep in mind as well, mix matters a lot in that as well. Also in Q1, we talked about 68% gross margins. Keep in mind that there's a much bigger component of revenue in Q1 that's services versus product. So you also get that bump in margin. You saw that in the last couple of Q1s as well. So, as we sit here today, we don't see a lot of movement in the gross margin numbers. Again that's based on the component costs that we see today. Mix does matter in the quarter, but we've largely stayed relatively consistent with how we're exiting Q4. So, I want to make sure I understand the question. You're not talking about gross margins. You're talking about operating margins, Nehal? Yes. So, at this point, as you said, you always want more. We feel good about talking about our gross margins. We're not going to go down to operating margins in that business that gets into a lot of allocations and things. So, what we're going to do is we're going to focus the business on gross margin. Do we certainly look at OpEx? And where we spend the money? Yes, we do. So, in terms of the Rule of 40, again, we have to go down the operating income. We won't do that. We will keep it at the gross margin discussion. What I would say is, hey, tune in after the Q1 call, and we'll talk about what we're going to disclose going in \u201822."

            "content": "Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I want to take a minute to acknowledge that it's been over a year that we have all been working remotely. I'm encouraged by the public health and economic improvements in many parts of the world, but the recovery is uneven. As you know, we have a large team in India. Our thoughts are with them, as they deal with a distressing surge in COVID cases. Thank you to the entire NetApp team for your dedication, focus, and execution throughout this challenging year. Now to the results of the quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter results, capping off a solid year of growth. Our results were all above our Q4 guidance ranges. I am most excited by the return of product revenue to growth, the strength of our public cloud ARR, and an all-time high free cash flow. Our performance was broad-based, as certain verticals, the U.S., and parts of Europe and Asia are recovering faster than many expected. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives have been accelerated by the pandemic and companies look to NetApp to support these key initiatives. Going into FY21, we had two clear priorities: returning to growth in our storage business powered by share gains from our industry-leading file, block and object software and scaling our highly differentiated public cloud services business. As I reflect on the past year, I am proud of what we have achieved during a globally challenging period. We remained focused in executing our strategy and extending our innovation. In Q4, product revenue grew 6% and our all-flash array business grew 11% year-over-year. Based on our growth, I am confident that we have gained share in the storage and all-flash markets. We advanced our hybrid cloud portfolio with the introduction of ONTAP 9.9 and Astra. This innovation will support continued product revenue growth and share gains through fiscal year \u201822. Additionally, we continue to make good progress with Keystone, with many new wins, including our largest ever Keystone deal. We are reaching more customers than ever before with our public cloud business. Over the course of fiscal year \u201821, we added approximately 1,500 new-to-NetApp customers with public cloud services and grew our total cloud customer count by 137% from Q4 fiscal year \u201820. In addition to adding new cloud customers, existing cloud customers are expanding their spend with us. Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate increased to 252% in the fourth quarter. Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights, and Spot all performed well in the quarter, driving our public cloud services ARR to $301 million exiting fiscal year \u201821, an increase of 171% year-over-year. As we have said repeatedly, our cloud strategy strongly advantages NetApp. I'll use a customer example to illustrate how cloud helps us to acquire new customers and drive growth in our on-premises solutions. As a part of its digital transformation strategy, a leading car manufacturer decided to migrate workloads from its on-premises data centers to the Azure cloud. Despite never having used NetApp previously, the customer chose NetApp Cloud Volumes to host its file-based data and NetApp Cloud Sync to rapidly move data from its Dell EMC systems to the cloud. In addition to delivering a high-performance data store in the cloud, Cloud Volumes provides out-of-the box cross region replication of production data to a secondary cloud environment, high availability to meet the service level requirements of critical applications, and cost savings through automatic tiering to Azure Blob Storage. Because of the breadth and depth of the value NetApp delivered, the customer is now looking to deploy a hybrid cloud environment and plans to use NetApp on-premises, as well as increase its NetApp usage in the public cloud. As I noted earlier, the pandemic accelerated and elevated the importance of customers' cloud and digital transformation initiatives. We expect that this trend will be ongoing, and that NetApp will continue to benefit from it. Customers appreciate the value we bring as a cloud-led, data-centric software company to simplify and modernize existing data centers, to quickly and confidently deploy applications, and to securely manage data on the public cloud. We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise data management technology; our cloud solutions drive further differentiation, expand our addressable market, and enable us to reach new customers. We began our cloud journey seven years ago, with the introduction of Cloud ONTAP, now, Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Our initial focus was to leverage the cloud to deliver backup and disaster recovery services to our installed base. We saw that enterprises wanted to move workloads to the cloud. To address that need, we began working with the leading cloud providers to deliver Cloud Volumes Service, a fully managed service with the application certifications required to support mission-critical, production workloads in the cloud. We then recognized the opportunity to expand beyond storage management and optimization to infrastructure monitoring and compute management and optimization services, which led to the development of Cloud Insights and the acquisition of Spot. These services, Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights, and Spot, are now the primary growth engines of our public cloud services business. They are well established for enterprise applications, and we are taking each of them into the cloud native world, further expanding our market opportunity. NetApp Astra offers application-aware data management that protects, moves, and manages data-rich Kubernetes workloads. Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability while minimizing costs. Cloud Insights for Kubernetes provides simplified infrastructure monitoring to quickly identify performance issues and resource constraints. Together, our public cloud services give our customers, and especially their CloudOps and DevOps teams, a robust suite of multi-cloud infrastructure management services. We plan to press our advantage here by focusing our efforts on enhancing our go-to-market activities, deepening our cloud partnerships, and delivering best-in-class organic and inorganic innovations. We intend to leverage our deep infrastructure expertise and our credibility with the cloud providers to expand our multi-cloud infrastructure management services. My confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal year \u201825 is further enhanced by the strength and uniqueness of our cloud services position. Our focused execution last year has set us up well for fiscal year \u201822. We have returned to growth, we are gaining share in key storage markets, and our public cloud services are at a scale where they are positively impacting total company billings and revenue growth. Our momentum underscores our value to customers in a hybrid, multi-cloud world. In fiscal year \u201822, we plan to accelerate our public cloud services and continue to grow our hybrid cloud business. I am excited about the year ahead and confident in our ability to deliver top line growth by supporting our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys. Before I turn it over to Mike to walk through our financial results, I want to take a moment to thank Brad Anderson, who let us know that he intends to retire at the end of fiscal year \u201822. Brad has been instrumental in leading the maturation of our Hybrid Cloud Group, and we will continue to leverage his leadership and expertise this year. We are actively engaged in identifying his successor to ensure a smooth transition. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike. Thank you for the question. We have been working on multiple innovation parts of our portfolio, all of which performed extremely strongly. Cloud Volumes for storage; Cloud Insights for monitoring; Spot for compute management, all had really strong Q4s and overall, really strong years. We saw good expansion in the number of customers and strong growth in the number of new-to-NetApp customers. We saw customers spending against their digital transformation and their cloud programs throughout the quarter. So, it was a smooth trajectory through the quarter. And I think that sets us up well for next year. I think, if you look at our dollar-based net retention rate, you can see that our organic business grew strongly this year, and we had about $60 million of this year being inorganic from acquisitions of Spot, Talon and CloudJumper. So, when you back that out, we expect next year's growth rate to also continue the acceleration of our organic portfolio and continued strength of our inorganic portfolio. We have a really good and differentiated portfolio of services. We have deep partnerships and are expanding the range of things we do with the hyperscalers. And we are growing our customer base of people who are doing many business-critical projects on the public clouds with us. So, I'm really excited with every confidence. We'll tell you more about our cloud business, as Mike indicated, as we go through the year, giving you more details on it. Thanks, Rod. With regard to the cloud portfolio, listen, I think the heavy lift in terms of getting the innovation portfolio to be in really good shape is behind us. I think, we have, as I said, three really strong innovation engines, and we are bringing out cloud-native innovations across those lineups as well through the course of the summer. We are making investments, as we indicated last quarter, to accelerate and expand the range of things we're doing in the cloud portfolio. With regard to what's it going to take to further accelerate the course of the business, it's all the things that we're doing, right? We're expanding the number of sellers and revenue-generating teams facing customers. We've seen really good success with Microsoft in terms of their route to market. We're working with the other hyperscalers to also train and expand the range of ways we take our products to market with them. And we're building our customer service and customer success teams. I feel even more confident that we have the range of capabilities to achieve the $1 billion target in ARR that we indicated. And the customer use cases that we are deploying on our public cloud portfolios, these are run the business applications, mission-critical, highly differentiated business value-creating application. So, I feel really, really good about where we are at the year. Mike, do you want to take the other part of the question? With regard to our technology portfolio, as Mike said, we have a range of configurations that we can support our customers with all the way from 900 gigs to 16 terabytes. And so, we have plenty of capability to given the flexibility in our software operating system to qualify the right components to meet customer needs and support them. With regard to the demand environment and gross margins, listen, as Mike said, we've operated through a tough year and done a really good job. I think that you'll see us continue to remain prudent, balancing end-user demand with margin management as we go through the year. Okay. Listen, as we go through the year, we see a continuing improvement in public health and the overall demand environment. We have been benefiting from cloud and digital transformation projects through the course of the year. We have not seen any major -- so we don't see some unique snapback or something like that in government spending or in enterprise spending. We see us benefiting from long-term trends and projects that are strategic to customers. We see more countries, especially the U.S. and parts of Western Europe come on line in a more significant way through the course of our fiscal year, the U.S. more likely in the first part of the fiscal year, Europe coming on line more strongly in the second half of our fiscal year. We have every confidence that our product portfolio is differentiated, and we'll continue to see product revenue grow faster than services revenue and the strength of our cloud portfolio. We have a much bigger base of customers now in the cloud business. We have a much broader range of application certifications that we entered last year. And so, we feel really, really good about the year ahead. I think, as we said, the typical sales productivity ramp happens over the course of four quarters. We are -- the 200 reps that we started adding in fiscal year \u201820 are fully productive. They're part of NetApp teams. You saw some of the benefits from their performance and additions to our teams, particularly in the Americas business, which was really strong, and it sets us up well for what we think will be a strong American recovery over the course of the next 12 months. With regard to continued additions, as Mike has said and what we have said before, we continue to be prudent about where we add those teams. We will do so where we see demand and environments being strong. And we'll tell you more about the course of that. We added some headcount in our customer success teams and in our cloud teams this past quarter. You should anticipate us continuing to do that to support the growth of the cloud portfolio. But, Mike, if you want to add any other color? Katy, I think we have many avenues as we have described to continue to drive the gross margins in our cloud business. There's a growing portfolio of software-only offerings in the cloud business. Spot, Cloud Insights, several versions of our Cloud Volumes offerings are all software. We -- Mike mentioned the hardware utilization. We have brought out new versions of our ONTAP operating systems that continue to be more efficient in terms of data management and storage efficiency. And so, we feel very good about our path to continuing to improve cloud gross margins in the direction that Mike articulated. Hey, I think, Jim, when we look at the business, we feel very good about our portfolio capabilities that we have today getting us to that $1 billion ARR number in fiscal year \u201825. We're not going to break out organic versus inorganic. I think, we feel that we've achieved a full year of integration of our core acquisitions, Spot, CloudJumper and Talon. So, we feel that the core bets are in place for this year. We will continue to look at inorganic acquisitions to fill out our portfolio, right? So, we think that we have a strong start to differentiated position in the cloud market. We feel really strong about the capabilities that we have. We will tell you more about it through the course of the business, through the course of -- as we expand the cloud business. And I'll just sit on three things, right? We are growing our cloud business while growing our core business. We are acquiring a lot of net new customers. We are accelerating our organic business growth and our inorganic acquisitions. And so, I feel really, really good about our business overall. Cloud gross margins, as Mike said, are near the corporate average, and as we go through next year, will be accretive to company gross margins. So, I just feel very, very good about our opportunity in the cloud and the work that our team has been doing with the cloud providers. And we're going to double down on it. I think, we'll continue to be careful about where we add sales teams. I think, we constantly rebalance to areas of opportunity, both in terms of the composition of the sales force and the locations where we put the headcount. I think, as I've said before, the recovery will be at different rates in different geographies. And I think as the public data indicates, the Americas is the place where we expect the recovery to be more pronounced this coming year, Europe lagging 6 to 9 months thereafter, and the rest of the developing economies maybe 6 to 9 months after that. So, we'll prioritize any additions in accordance with how we see the end user demand. With cloud, we have been adding, step-wise. I think one of the important things that we're focused on this year is to get our frontline sales teams to be balanced with selling cloud and our systems in customers' data centers. And so, I feel like, listen, we're not going to have a stepwise addition in our investment. We'll do it as the business comes. And we feel very good about the disciplined approach we've taken and the payoffs for those investments in fairly short order. I think on the 200 heads, as we've said, they are fully productive, fully part of the NetApp sales team. We are adding some -- we added some cloud headcount in last quarter, we anticipate to add some more this year. Alongside the course of the business, they will take some time to get productive, but those are in the same range of productivity ramps as our traditional sales headcount. I think, what you see from this coming year from our guidance to the coming year is that revenue outpaces the growth in operating expense, leading to additional leverage in our business model. That reflects our disciplined approach to investing where we see the opportunities. Listen, I think with regard to component costs, as Mike said, as we look out the next year, we see that the component cost in aggregate for the full year is going to be relatively flat to this year with some puts and takes in terms of the mix. I think that with regard to cloud gross margins, it's really reflecting the balance of certain regions getting more heavily utilized and seeing customer consumption of the installed footprint, while we make investments in other regions to continue to expand our business. And that trade-off between investing to continue to expand the business with the growth in ARR is the balance we walk. I think as I also mentioned, we have several other avenues to continue to drive gross margins in cloud. The software mix in the portfolio is growing with solutions like Spot and Cloud Insights and some versions of our Cloud Volumes products being software-only. The second is we continue to drive efficiency in the software, in ONTAP operating system software. So, there are lots of avenues to continue to accelerate cloud gross margins. Team has done a good job this year. And we expect it to be accretive to company gross margins as we go through next fiscal year. Listen, I feel really good about our flash business. We are focused, differentiated and executing in the market. I think, our strong position in the sweet spot of the storage industry, which is the midrange part of the market, is clearly evident, and it is affecting the growth rates of our competitors. We have taken share for the last several quarters, and we see every confidence that we will continue to do that going forward. What we said at the Analyst Day was that over the next few years, the all-flash array market will grow at about 7.5% CAGR, and we expect to outpace that this coming year. We expect that the storage industry will grow around 4%, and our revenue picture expects us to outpace the growth of the storage industry overall. So, we feel really good. And ONTAP 9.9 coming out gives us even more confidence in our differentiation. Thanks, Kris. In closing, we delivered a great end to a strong year. And we are well-positioned as we move into fiscal year \u201822. I want to reiterate that our public cloud business is at a scale where it is contributing meaningfully to revenue and billings growth. And the innovations we deliver to our hybrid cloud business will support continued product revenue growth. In fiscal year \u201822, we expect to grow the top line, deliver operating leverage and generate significant free cash flow, all while investing in growth initiatives. I am excited by and confident in our ability to capitalize on the industry transitions and the market opportunities ahead. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you for joining us. And a special thank you to our NetApp team."

I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I hope that you and your loved ones have stayed safe and healthy since the last time we spoke. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another strong quarter with our third consecutive quarter of revenue and billings growth despite the challenging environment. In the third quarter, our team delivered revenues at the top of our guidance range and operating margin and EPS above the high end of our expectations.  Our performance in Q3 was broad-based, with notable strength in Americas enterprise. The incremental sales capacity we added in FY '20 continues to pay off. Additionally, our Run to NetApp competitive takeout program is delivering continued success as we gain share and displace competitors' installed bases. Most importantly, this quarter, we once again demonstrated our ability to grow in both of our key markets: cloud and all-flash arrays. As we have said many times, cloud is additive to our business, that what we do in the cloud helps expand our on-premises business and that our enterprise hardened software and experience provide a solid foundation for our work in the cloud.  Cloud services ARR grew to $237 million, an increase of 186% year-over-year. We saw good momentum across the portfolio, with Azure NetApp Files and Spot being the standout services, both delivering significant growth. We continue to expand with existing customers while adding new enterprise and cloud-native customers. Our cloud services dollar-based net retention rate is a healthy 227%.  Our cloud partners are asking us to expand regional deployments, broaden workload certifications and invest in go-to-market activities to support this rapidly growing business. We had a significant presence at both AWS re:Invent and at Google Sales kickoff meeting. This engagement helps us stay top of mind with their sellers and reach customers with our cloud value proposition.  We are benefiting as customers move more Tier 1 workloads such as SAP to the cloud. Our cloud volume service delivers the performance and availability required by mission-critical applications. To address the substantial cloud opportunity ahead, we are pulling forward investments with our public cloud partners, adding dedicated sales capacity and expanding our presence in additional regions. As we look ahead, we have a strong pipeline to support our Q4 target. Our cloud partner engagement and expanding product road map reinforce our confidence in our long-term goal of achieving $1 billion in cloud ARR in fiscal year '25.  Our all-flash business grew 11% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.6 billion. For the third consecutive quarter, we believe we outpaced the market, gaining share from competitors and converting our installed base from hybrid arrays to all-flash. At the end of Q3, 27% of installed systems were all-flash, giving us plenty of headroom for continued growth. Our all-flash arrays received accolades from industry analysts and customers alike. They integrate cloud connectivity with the speed and efficiency of flash to deliver a smart, powerful and trusted solution for the most demanding enterprise workloads.  In Q3, we expanded the breadth of our flash offerings with the introduction of the FAS500f, our first all-flash array leveraging QLC technology. The FAS500f is a highly scalable solution for deployments that support huge volumes of unstructured data such as medical imaging, electronic design automation and computer-aided design and manufacturing.  Our cloud services and flash systems are built on the same primary software foundation, ONTAP. This shared R&D foundation gives us significant leverage in our R&D investment. We are able to innovate and test at cloud speed while bringing new functionality to the enterprise data center at a pace IT can absorb. This shared innovation also benefits customers, giving them a similar operating environment and consistent data management tools on-premises and in the cloud. It also enables them to move their data seamlessly to the right location at the right price at the right time.  As I noted on our last call, NetApp is helping customers accelerate their digital transformations and put their data to work to elevate their businesses. Digital transformation is now a necessity, requiring speed and agility to respond to changing business conditions. Hybrid cloud is the de facto IT architecture at digitally transformed enterprises for the foreseeable future.  Having an integrated flexible data management foundation is critical to the success of digital transformation efforts. Because of this, data is growing in scale and importance. We believe that NetApp is a primary beneficiary of this trend. We are uniquely positioned to address customers' requirements for workloads that move to the cloud as well as those that maintain and modernize on premises.  Let me share a few wins from the third quarter to illustrate why customers choose NetApp to manage their data in the hybrid cloud. A global pharmaceutical manufacturer needed to overcome the compliance challenges of regulatory mandates while minimizing security risks in moving to the public cloud. They selected NetApp all-flash FAS to underpin their AI-driven health care because of our cloud connectivity and the ability to achieve petabyte scale, along with our unique data protection and data management capabilities.  At a leading global clinical trial laboratory, NetApp displaced Dell to host workloads for the company's AI labs. We won because of our performance, cloud connectivity and data management and security capabilities. The ability to leverage NetApp cloud services when necessary was critical to the customer's decision.  Calendar 2020 was a difficult year for all of us and I'm glad to have it behind us. I want to express my gratitude to the NetApp team for quickly coming together to deliver solid results by helping our customers thrive while working remotely. We see reasons for optimism for calendar 2021 with expanding vaccine availability and improving public health conditions. However, uncertainty about the new normal as well as the tax and regulatory environments remain. In uncertain markets, data is even more critical as organizations look to drive competitive advantage, and we are confident in our strategy and the strength of our business going forward.  Cloud and All Flash FAS fuel the momentum in our high margin software, cloud services and recurring maintenance revenue streams. This growth, coupled with our disciplined OpEx management, balanced approach to investing in the business and sustained capital returns will create significant long-term shareholder value.  The new NetApp is a cloud-led software company and it's built on a solid foundation. We are a trusted partner to the world's leading organizations who are undertaking digital transformations. We have unique strategic partnerships with the world's leading clouds, including deeply integrated technology and go-to-market efforts. And we have a strong business model with a proven track record of turning market transitions to our advantage. As the recovery gradually unfolds, we believe we will be in an even stronger position as customers continue to turn to NetApp to help them solve the challenge of managing data in the hybrid cloud. I'll now turn it over to Mike for more details on our results. Mike?\nMichael Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. We delivered another solid quarter, with revenue at the high end of our guide and operating margin and EPS above expectations. Importantly, solid execution yielded Q3 billings of $1.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year. This is our third straight quarter of year-over-year billings growth. In Q3, net revenue of $1.47 billion increased 5% year-over-year, including 2 points of currency tailwind.  We believe our 2 key strategic focus areas, our industry-leading all-flash storage business and public cloud services, both continued to outperform the market. When combined, software revenue, recurring maintenance and cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 13% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. We ended Q3 with $3.8 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth.  As we highlighted at our Investor Day, all-flash systems carry higher software and maintenance dollar content relative to the rest of our portfolio. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue of $652 million was up 11% year-over-year, positioning us for share gains for the third consecutive quarter. Only 27% of our installed systems were all-flash at the end of Q3, providing a very healthy runway for our flash business.  Public cloud services delivered a solid $237 million in ARR, growing 186% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. We continue to see strong demand from our customer cohorts with Q3 dollar-based net retention rate coming in at 227%. Given the strong sales pipeline heading into Q4, we expect to exit fiscal '21 with cloud ARR of $260 million to $290 million. We remain excited about our expanding cloud product road map, which includes continued co-development and deep R&D partnerships with the public cloud partners.  As we head into fiscal '22, we are investing in additional cloud sales capacity to support our expanding product road map and our partners' go-to-market motion. We remain confident in our ability to deliver $1 billion in cloud ARR in fiscal '25.  Total product revenue of $775 million decreased approximately 2% year-over-year. As George noted, in the quarter, we saw good engagement from enterprise accounts, particularly in the Americas, where the sales capacity added last year is paying dividends. Consistent with the growth we delivered in Q2, software product revenue of $428 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio.  Recurring maintenance and cloud revenue of $627 million was an all-time company high and was up 13% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. To help with your modeling of maintenance, please note Q3 includes a $7 million year-to-date adjustment from hardware maintenance revenue to software maintenance revenue. To be clear, this adjustment did not impact total maintenance revenue in the quarter.  Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high end of guidance. Product gross margin was 53.4% and consistent with our expectations. Our recurring maintenance, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us with gross margin of 82.9%.  Q3 operating expenses of $668 million were in line with our expectations. Operating margin of 21.9% and EPS of $1.10 were both nicely ahead of our guidance, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Cash flow from operations was $373 million and free cash flow was $341 million, representing 23% of revenue. Year-to-date free cash flow of $650 million is up 13% year-over-year. We expect operating cash flow to grow double digits for the full fiscal year.  During Q3, we reinitiated our share repurchase program, buying back $50 million in stock. During the quarter, we also paid out $107 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $157 million to shareholders in Q3, representing 46% of free cash flow. We closed Q3 with $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments.  Now to guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.44 billion and $1.54 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 6% increase in revenues year-over-year and includes 3 points of currency tailwind. Given our growing confidence in the business, we narrowed the revenue range to $100 million. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to range between 21% and 22% in Q4. Assumed in this guidance, our operating expenses of $675 million to $685 million.  Given the magnitude of our cloud opportunity, we plan to pull forward investments in both sales capacity and our product road map, positioning our cloud services for continued rapid growth heading into fiscal '22. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%. And we expect earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.06 and $1.14 per share. Assumed in this guidance is interest expense of $15 million.  In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for continued execution and commitment in delivering another outstanding quarter. We remain incredibly well positioned to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Let's open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: I have two questions. The first is you're expecting cloud ARR sequential growth to accelerate next quarter. Can you just talk about, is that on the back of the investments that you're talking about accelerating in the quarter? Or is this just pipeline dynamics where you had some deals that maybe didn't convert in January and were pushed into the April quarter?\nGeorge Kurian: It's on the back of pipeline dynamics. We have a strong pipeline heading into Q4 and it's our fiscal year-end, so we have every confidence that our sales teams are going to make a real good push to finish the year strong. We've had a really good year-to-date in Q3. We saw organic growth of 123% in cloud ARR as well as total growth of 186%. And if you look at the midpoint of our range that we have guided to, the incremental growth in Q4 is the same incremental number as what we did in Q2. So we feel good about the finish. The investments that Mike and I are both making is to help continue to scale the cloud business. The majority of the benefit of that will really be next fiscal year.\nKaty Huberty: Great. And then George, how would you compare the pipeline today, the broader deal pipeline today versus three months ago? And how does that shape your view of what the demand recovery will look like over the next several quarters?\nGeorge Kurian: We've had three really good quarters. And if you look at our -- the finish to Q3, if you look at both days sales outstanding as well as inventory turns, we had a regular January, so linearity was good throughout the past quarter. Q4, the early signs are very constructive. The pipeline's strong. Our competitive position, I would not trade for anyone else in the market. So I feel really, really good about the opportunity ahead not only in Q4 but going forward.  I think what you see in our guidance is a bit of prudence, given that there's still a COVID environment. That while the vaccine availability provides incremental confidence, there are many other elements that need to come together to really give total line of sight to the new normal. That includes tax, regulation, new policy decision frameworks from the government, the stimulus package and other things.  So we feel very good about the year. We feel really good about the pipeline heading into Q4. Our competitive position is strong and differentiated as we have demonstrated with share gains for 3 successive quarters. I think what we are trying to balance is the really good confidence in our business with the fact that we're still operating in a pandemic environment. Mike, you want to add?\nMichael Berry: So thanks, George. Katy, it's Mike. The 1 thing I'd add, too, is when you take a look at the guide, keep in mind that on a year-to-date basis, billings are up and that's really what we are focusing you folks on, about 7%, and revenue, when you adjust for the 14th week, is about three. So embedded in that guidance is still a pretty significant growth in billings, which to us is the leading indicator of business with our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: I guess, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more around the all-flash array growth, which double digits is fairly impressive. I guess, I'd love to understand, how much of this growth do you think is coming from conversion of your installed base to all-flash array versus net new customers? Is there a way to kind of piece that out? And then over time, what's the optimal level for this 27% of your installed base getting to as a percent of all-flash array?\nGeorge Kurian: So our overall installed base, which is a very large number, is growing in both systems and customers, right? So we feel very, very good about the opportunity. We've been in this business in the all-flash array business for many, many years, and we are growing the penetration of the all-flash footprint in our installed base by roughly 1% a quarter. And so there's a long runway ahead, a very long runway ahead of all-flash penetration.  What we are feeling very, very good about is the fact that we've demonstrated share gains. We are not demonstrating the rate of penetration of the market and the rate of share gains without winning net new customers and net new workloads. Yes, installed base continues to be an opportunity, but what I feel really good about is the fact that we are growing at the expense of the competition this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Just as a follow-up to Amit's question, how should I think about the overall flash array growth this year? Because at this run rate, you can do perhaps high-teen growth and I want to just get more color on that. And I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: I think there's two ways that I think about it. One is what's the aggregate market and then what's the percentage of the market that is all-flash. I think as we said, the aggregate market continues to get better steadily. We feel very good about the progress we've made as part of the overall market. We think that the macro trends this coming year should be better than what we had in the past year. There's a little bit of uncertainty with the specific timing of when everything gets better. But overall, sort of the bigger picture, there's no question that '21 calendar year will be a better year than '20.  I think within that, then we have gained share in the market. And within our overall portfolio, we see all-flash continuing to be a greater part of the mix, especially as newer technologies that make flash more cost-effective comes to market. So things like QLC, where we are in the early innings of. So as I said, we don't think flash will be 100% of the storage market. We think it will be a substantial percentage. And we think that, that transition affords us opportunity to gain share of new customers as well as to sell more software-rich, higher-margin configurations to customers.\nMehdi Hosseini: Great. And just as a follow-up to that, how do you see material costs, specifically NAND costs, impacting and especially in the context of increased QLC procurement?\nMichael Berry: It's Mike. So I'll answer that in two ways. One is we did -- obviously, in the first half, we saw significantly higher NAND prices. They have modulated a bit and came back to, I'll call it, relatively flat in Q3. We do expect it to be a tailwind to us slightly in Q -- our Q4.  Looking into '22, I think you'll see that continue. We are starting to see some of the demand pick up, especially in the second half of next year, especially around mobile and hyperscalers as well. As you all know, mobile is 30%, 40% of that business. So we expect in the second half of next year for that to kind of reverse itself. Also, keep in mind, DRAM prices are up quite a bit for us. It's not nearly the percentage of component cost but that offsets a little bit. And for us, QLC, look, we're just getting started with that so there's not much of an impact, I'll call it, in the near term.\nOperator: Next question comes from Nik Todorov of Longbow Research.\nNikolay Todorov: George, you talked about your cloud partners asking for additional broader workload certification. Maybe can you give us a little bit more color on that? And also, any additional color you can give us on the different customer sets that are adopting your cloud services? Is there any way you can delineate between the growth you're seeing from existing enterprise customers versus new cloud-only customers? And also, what are you seeing from your public sector customers when it comes to demand for CDS?\nGeorge Kurian: Okay. So let me get that in three ways. The first was, listen, we are certified for a broad range of workloads with Microsoft and Google. And they are -- we are pursuing additional workloads with them as customers deploy on our platforms. This could be software vendors that are deploying Software as a Service environments in the public clouds. This could be new types of applications, containerized applications, cloud-native applications. There are a whole new set of opportunities for NetApp.  And it is also certifications and deployments in parts of the world where we haven't deployed yet. So we completed the FedRAMP certification, which opens up the public sector market for our Azure NetApp Files. There's opportunity to do that with other cloud providers and other services, for example, our monitoring services in the portfolio. That's 1 set of things that we're going to keep doing.  The other is expanding deployments. So we've covered -- with some of the cloud providers, we've covered the large markets. Now we are starting to pursue parts of the world, for example, in Asia Pacific or Latin America that we didn't cover before. And so this is the ongoing build-out.  I think with regard to the sets of customer types that we see, we are really excited at the progress that we've achieved this year. We are acquiring customers at an accelerating pace in our cloud business. And once they join NetApp's cloud portfolio, our dollar-based retention rate shows up really strongly. They really like our offerings and they expand deployment substantially with us.  They are across a broad range of verticals, more in the less regulated than in the regulated industries where we are still going through certifications. The second is they cover a broad range of customer types, whether they are digital natives that never bought from NetApp, enterprises that were primarily competitors, customers or customers that use NetApp.  As our all-flash array business and our cloud business have demonstrated for multiple quarters in a row, cloud is additive to our overall business. And there are customers who start with us in the cloud, who then come back and buy stuff in the data center. So very pleased with the progress. The work that we are doing with the cloud providers will continue to expand in scale and scope and which is why, again, I feel really good about our long-term opportunity and the ability to reach the $1 billion ARR target in fiscal year '25.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors.\nSteven Fox: I was wondering if you could just talk about what the impact of the mix of all-flash arrays was on margins, not necessarily -- I know I understand the software percentage help. But like I think last quarter, you benefited from larger-scale system sales. What was it like this quarter and what's your thinking into the next quarter?\nMichael Berry: Steven, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So yes, we talked a lot in Q2 about the ASF, all-flash systems being driven by high end. And when we gave our guidance for Q3, we talked about, hey, we thought that would normalize a little bit and that's exactly what happened. So we had another very strong quarter in all-flash systems.  But there's a little bit more, I'll call it, normally distributed between low, mid and high, and that's what we saw. And I think you can see that in the product margin. And then, again, they were helped a little bit by lower NAND costs. So it came in pretty much what we expected, much more normal distribution. And that's also what we're expecting going into Q4. Again, it's tough for us to do demand shaping of those because of the great flexibility in our products, our customers can do different configurations to still achieve that performance. So we expect it to be pretty normal and similar to Q3.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: You've mentioned strength in the Americas enterprise. I wonder if you could dig a bit deeper into it, maybe on a sector basis. And then what are you seeing and hearing from your customers as you look forward over the next few quarters? You can either stick with Americas or you could go and talk geographically.\nGeorge Kurian: I think I'll just say that we feel very good about the finish to Q3. The book of business was balanced geographically. We drew out the Americas because of the fact that the performance was particularly strong in the Americas. As you know, our business is preponderantly enterprise, meaning small, medium business is a small percentage of our total business. It didn't perform badly. It performed well but it's a small percentage of our total business.  On the enterprise, I think what we saw was a continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2, which is stabilization of demand, normal linearity through the quarter, the sort of COVID strong segments, meaning the ones that were -- had business models that were less impacted by COVID like financial services or health care, continue to be strong demand sources for us, and we have really good offerings in that part of the market.  I think with regard to the outlook, again, I think as we said, many, many customers are starting to prioritize the new normal, what business looks like going forward. Digital transformation becomes a key part of any business's go-forward plans, and we are a big part of enabling a modern data foundation for digital transformation. So those projects continue to move forward. NetApp has really good technology to also help in hybrid cloud and cybersecurity projects, for example, protection against ransomware and other types of malicious data threats. And we saw a good pickup across the portfolio for that as well.\nOperator: Next question is from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital.\nAnanda Baruah: Just love to get your thoughts, you talked about increasing the investment on sales capacity and yield coverage on cloud. Should we anticipate any impact to margins intermediate term as you ramp that? Or does the momentum just kind of overwhelm the incremental cost?\nMichael Berry: Ananda, it's Mike. So I think a little bit different than what we did last year was when we did a really great thing by bringing on the 200 sales folks. For us, this is just much more continued investment in that business. And I think that you'll see it more or less just play right into the P&L, as we've talked about, continued great growth in that business. So our goal is to continue to add sales capacity in line with that revenue growth to continue to drive it. So I wouldn't expect to see any kind of a bump on margins, specifically related to that.\nOperator: Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank, your line is open.\nSidney Ho: As I kind of look at your fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance, at the midpoint, it will be up 6% year-over-year, up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Do you expect every reportable businesses to be up similarly on a sequential basis? I'm particularly interested in your comment on software maintenance, given how strong it was in the quarter. I understand there was a reclassification that helped the software side last quarter.\nMichael Berry: Yes. So if you bifurcate the different revenue numbers, and keep in mind, Sidney, that, that was, if you look at total maintenance, there was no impact to that. So as we look to Q4, we would expect to see maintenance continue to be strong in the quarter. I think sequentially, you saw maintenance actually drop a little bit. We would expect to see it grow slightly; cloud continue to grow; and then product revenue likely growing or similar levels to what we've seen in Q1, 2 and 3.  And this goes back to Katy's question because again, I just want to keep talking about this is, keep in mind that billings growth has been 6%, 10% and 6% in the first three quarters. Product growth over that time when you back out the 14th week as an average about 3%. So mix matters here a lot. And so to that point and to the earlier question on maintenance, we do expect to see continued growth in maintenance as we do more off-line systems, continued growth in cloud and product revenue will be a result really of the mix in all-flash. Hopefully, that helps.\nSidney Ho: Yes.\nOperator: Simon Leopold of Raymond James, your line is open.\nVictor Chiu: This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I wanted to follow up on the enterprise spending question that someone asked previously. Do you have a sense for which areas enterprises will be prioritizing as they resume spending into recovery, for example, campus investments versus data center investments, et cetera, and how kind of NetApp falls into that picture?\nGeorge Kurian: We don't do a lot of business in the campus. I think we -- the primary part of our business is in the data center. And I think as I mentioned earlier, we saw a good pickup in -- throughout the year, people have been prioritizing big transformational projects, which they cannot defer because they don't want to fall behind their competitors. We saw priorities in hybrid cloud and modernizing data center environments using flash technologies. Those are our key bets and they've played out really well for us throughout the year.  I think in Q3, we saw normal linearity. So you can see from our DSO and from our inventory turns that we did not have a back-end loaded quarter. It was pretty steady linearity throughout the quarter and we feel good about that. That's a good sign heading into the rest of the calendar year for us. And so we feel -- we've done well. We've controlled what we can control really well. The macro environment is still uncertain but it's getting better. And so we'll take those and we'll continue to execute.\nVictor Chiu: That's helpful. And just quickly along the lines of drivers, could you provide us an update around your as-a-service offering and progress you're seeing there? Has the pandemic disrupted the pushout the time line of kind of trials and acceptance around that?\nGeorge Kurian: We serve customers in multiple ways. An as-a-service offering, we have ways to support them on public cloud environments, which are as a service and instantaneous we have the ability to give them financial solutions and/or managed subscription solutions.  Our Keystone portfolio continues to make progress in the market. We have some good wins in the quarter. We've had some good successes against competitors and we feel really good about our offering there. It's early going. And we don't, unlike some of our other competitors, we don't think that the market has a single mandate. Customers want to buy in multiple ways, and we have the ability to meet those requirements in multiple ways.\nOperator: Karl Ackerman of Cowen, your line is open.\nKarl Ackerman: Mike, how should we think about the growth you're seeing in your as-a-service offerings between existing accounts versus new accounts? And I'm hoping you could shed light on the margin and content differential between new and existing accounts this quarter as well as in the context of your progression toward the $1 billion cloud ARR target?\nMichael Berry: Yes. So if we take a look at new versus existing accounts, as George talked about, we really look at the public cloud business as being the driver of new customers for us and we've seen that. In addition, when you look at the dollar-based net retention, but obviously, our existing customers, we're seeing great growth there as well. One of the nice things about the cloud business is from a margin perspective, it's not going to vary that much in terms of new versus existing. Certainly, existing customers that have more than 1 product, you'll start to see some margin expansion there as well.  But as we look across new versus existing, I don't think there's a material difference there. However, I think that will help expand those margins as we go forward. We've talked about our driver in terms of driving gross margins in the cloud business. Especially as they take on more than 1 product, more data services and more solutions, that will certainly help us scale that business at a higher margin.\nGeorge Kurian: If I could add, as we mentioned at our Financial Analyst Day, cloud over time will become accretive to the margins -- gross margins of the overall business. We feel good about the progress we have made towards achieving that objective. We're not breaking out the cloud gross margins but we did make progress even this past quarter. So we're making steady progress towards achieving that objective.  With regard to Keystone, Keystone does not -- we have not seen to date an existing customer that has an all-flash deployment suddenly show up and say, \"I want to convert that to a Keystone deployment.\" These are usually net new environments and customers and/or net new customers. It's not like we're seeing our traditional deployed environment convert to a Keystone basis. And so these are additive opportunities to our overall business and there are healthy margin opportunities.\nOperator: Next question comes from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs.\nRoderick Hall: I just wanted to check in with you guys on supplies. I know the semiconductor supplies shortage is affecting a lot of people. Just curious if you could comment on whether you're anticipating that in the guide. And also what you think the supplies outlook is for the remainder of this year. And then maybe real quick, you could comment that AFA number was super strong again. Just comment on whether you think you gained share again and substantial share like you did last quarter or maybe a little bit less share. Just curious what you think that overall AFA market has done this quarter.\nMichael Berry: Rod, it's Mike. I'll take the first part and then George will jump in on the second one. So as we -- so when we looked at the semi supply chain, they have lots of news and noise out there on that one. We don't expect there to be any impact for Q4. As we look into next year, for us, it's hopefully not as much of a P&L impact. We will likely, like other folks, go buy ahead a little bit to make sure that we have enough of that supply. We had 19x inventory turns. We've talked about this back when I first started last year.  I intend to see that come down a little bit. It's the prudent thing to do, given the cost of capital to make sure we have that supply. So I would expect it to impact more of the balance sheet than the P&L. But certainly, we'll keep you up to speed as we go through this.\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to the all-flash array number, we feel that we continue to take market share. I think that our portfolio continues to be the best 1 in the market. And based on other people that reported this week or today, we have taken share, right? So we'll wait for the rest of the roundup to come, but we feel really, really good about our position in the market. We've had 3 really good quarters. We're focused. We're executing and we're taking share. And I feel really good about our position, better today than even at the start of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: You noted this pull forward in some of the spend relative to cloud. And I was wondering, A, are you changing or think that, that would change the CDS number of 400 to 500 for fiscal '22? And secondarily, how long should we expect that elevated OpEx? Is it a 1-quarter phenomena or is that going to be sort of the new normal and then we see OpEx sort of trend from there?\nMichael Berry: Yes. Wamsi, it's Mike. So on that, as we just talked a couple of minutes ago, we just expect to continue to invest in the cloud business as we see the opportunity and we clearly see a great opportunity. And that's in sales and in R&D to make sure we're moving the product road map forward. So I don't think, again, you'll see a bump or a reduction in the margins as it relates to that. The goal is to continue to invest in that as we go forward.  But we haven't -- we'll talk to you about where we think we'll finish next year when we get into fiscal '22. But we think that this is -- as you know, George and I have all talked about, hey, disciplined spending around OpEx. Disciplined spending for us also means we want to invest where we see a return and we absolutely see a return on those dollars.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. And if I could, sorry if I missed this, but you had extremely strong free cash flow margins in the quarter. Can you comment on what drove that?\nMichael Berry: Yes, absolutely. I'd love to talk about cash. So say, 2 things on cash, Wamsi. One is, keep in mind that compared to last year, we paid virtually all of our U.S. federal taxes in Q2 of last year. So let's talk about year-to-date. The margins were great in this quarter. I think it was 23%. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow is up 13% year-over-year. Also keep in mind that in that number in fiscal '21, we've also paid about $75 million of taxes related to the IP transfer from the spot acquisition. So it's actually a little bit stronger than that.  As George talked about, our DSOs were super strong. They were 49 days, below -- anytime you get below 50, it's great. So linearity certainly helped our invoicing and our collections in the quarter. But yes, very strong free cash flow results, feel really good about that on a year-to-date basis.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jim Suva of Citigroup Investment.\nJames Suva: You've provided a lot of good clarity. And I have 1 question and it's probably best for both George and Mike to answer. But can you just walk us through, when NAND pricing goes higher, like, George, how does your sales force react to that? And then, Mike, maybe the margin and revenue impact, does it impact margins a lot? Can you offset it fast enough or does your billings get impacted favorably from higher NAND prices or not? I'm just kind of worried -- I'm not worried. I'm wondering about the relationships, the talks and the financial of when component pricing, since you're doing so well in all-flash arrays, when NAND component prices go up, what's the sales force reaction and the financial implications?\nGeorge Kurian: Okay. Maybe I can start first. We have a broad range of purchasing agreements with customers. I think for some, there are preferred pricing agreements or master purchasing agreements where they are locked into pricing schedules where we don't have the ability to move pricing up or down depending on what happens to NAND prices. In the transactional environment, where there's no long-term pricing agreements, we are -- we take a look at the impact of commodity prices. We typically pass that through either beneficially or to disadvantage to customers. We're not trying to hedge it.  I think we are cognizant this time in the COVID environment of the particular challenge that our customers face so we try to be a good partner to them. As Mike and I both said at Financial Analyst Day, post COVID, given the continued progress of our all-flash array business, we see the ability to return to the mid-50s product gross margins.\nMichael Berry: Yes. Just to keep going on that path, Jim, as George talked about, we do see that path. We don't expect to see the kind of increases that we saw, I think, earlier in the first half. Supply and demand will certainly dictate that. The other thing to keep in mind, too, and this is why we've talked about this so much, I will always push you to look at total gross margins because also, hey, cloud billings, not impacted by it. The more we do renewals, which is a huge part of our business, and it's been a great success story also helps as well. So from a financial perspective, this is something we look at, sure. But there are so many other things, too, that drive it.  Keep in mind, NAND may go up, DRAM may go down, something else may move around. We have a great supply chain team. They're looking at it all the time in terms of what it means financially. But again, we don't know going into next year where in the final supply and demand will end. We'll certainly keep you up-to-date every quarter.\nOperator: Next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital.\nNehal Chokshi: Great quarter and it looks like good guidance for me. Can you talk about -- it was great that you guys are talking about a $1 billion ARR by fiscal year '25 for public cloud services. But what do you expect to be the sustainable growth rate after you get there? And what's sustainable dollar-based net revenue retention rate to drive that as well?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think we have strong aspirations to grow our cloud business. I think we have every confidence that we have a multiyear game plan of achieving the $1 billion ARR number. I think we will give you the ability to sustain growth rates beyond that when we get to it.  What I'll give you a sense of is, cloud is a gigantic market, and the growth of cloud over the next 5 years will be much bigger than the growth of cloud over the past 5 years. So if you think that there is constraints to overall TAM, I just think that even the $1 billion ARR will be a small part of the overall cloud market in that time frame. So we're not TAM-constrained. I think our position in the market is unique, and we are continuing to execute on product road map expansions and go-to-market investments, as Mike and I have talked about in prepared remarks.  With regard to dollar-based net retention, I think it reflects the strength of our offerings. When a customer signs up and is activated and starts to work with us, they grow substantially in terms of their usage of our products, which is really good. I think both Mike and I see that over time, it should trend back towards more industry norms. I think 227%, which we had this quarter, is well above industry norms, reflecting the early phase of our cloud journey. Mike, feel free to add.\nMichael Berry: Yes. Keep going on that path, and we talked about this at Investor Day. We do expect this to come back, call it, industry norms, if that's, call it, 110, 120, 130. Very importantly, once you get to $1 billion and you that, certainly, we want it to continue to be a driver of new customers. But gosh, that upsell, cross-sell renewal, that motion is so critical. That's actually part of the sales investment that we're making is to make sure we have that great support team that can go in there and help our customers once they sign up for those services. And there's a lot of great examples of companies that do that well. So we do expect, in conjunction with getting there, that we'll be able to continue to drive great retention but it will come down to the industry norms over time.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay, great. And then if I can bring that into -- on a shorter-term basis. You've provided a target of $260 million to $290 million for the end of this year. At the low end of that range, what would have to occur? Because that seems like that would be probably a disappointing outcome. And then conversely, at the high end of the range, what would have to happen is that would seem to be an amazing outcome actually.\nGeorge Kurian: I think it's all execution. I think we see a good -- a strong pipeline in Q4. It comes down to transaction execution, getting customers signed up, managing through the COVID challenges that customers are still facing, right? We have customers whose employees are not on site, who we can get to negotiate with only a certain number of days of the week. And that's what it comes down to.  I think the overall demand profile for our services is fantastic. I think we've added customers at an accelerating pace through the course of the year. And the types of workloads that we are deploying, these are mega-market opportunities, databases, virtual machines, file sharing, high-performance computing. So we're not opportunity-constrained. I think we just got to execute and bring in the transactions.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jason Ader of William Blair.\nWilliam Fitzsimmons: This is Billy Fitzsimmons on for Jason Ader. I know you talked about how Spot was a standout in the quarter, and you also talked about at the Analyst Day how there are only 5% of customers where there's overlap between Spot and NetApp. And obviously, there have also been some changes to your sales org in the last couple of quarters, Cesar joined in July. So to that end, George, can you please talk on how the typical customer conversation has evolved versus a year or 2 ago, given some of those leadership changes as well as the introduction of some newer products and some of those products from acquisitions such as talent jump Spot\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. I think, first of all, we have a massively larger customer base now than we did a couple of years ago, right? Even a year ago, we have a massively larger customer base, whether that's acquired through NetApp sales force, whether that's acquired through Microsoft or Google sales force or Spot, the installed base of customers to whom we can cross-sell and upsell products, like Mike mentioned, is massively larger at this point than it was a year ago.  I think with regard to what Spot brings to the table is they bring 2 assets to the table. One is that they are able to solve a large and growing customer problem, which is the problem of unused or unspent cloud dollars, and that is a topic that is near and dear to every CFO and CIO that I talk to, including Mike at NetApp. We're a customer of Spot and they save us a substantial amount of money.  We are able to use Spot not only to go after cloud-native digital native customers that never bought from NetApp, as well as to now find ways into new parts of large enterprises that didn't know NetApp and now get pleasantly surprised by the whole cloud portfolio. So I'm super excited.  They also have a really good offering for container-based workloads that, in combination with some of our storage offerings, gives us a really expanded set of differentiated capabilities for truly cloud-native applications.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Paul Chung of JPMorgan.\nPaul Chung: So you mentioned nice market share gains in all-flash, so just a follow-up there. Can you just expand on how you're displacing competitors? Which types of verticals you're seeing more success? I know your gross margins are down mostly on mix, but any impact from pricing? Just anything you want to highlight on how you're beating competition?\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to the competitive programs, our Run to NetApp competitive program continues to have really good results. Q3 was the strongest of the 3 quarters that we've had the program running. And it is a broad mix of customers. Given the mix of our business, they're mostly enterprise accounts. And we are winning new footprint, meaning new workloads displacing the larger legacy incumbents. So whether it's an HP or a Hitachi with their products, or whether it's Dell going through a transition of its midrange, we are winning against those players.  The strength of NetApp is our software differentiation. The fact that we can simplify a customer's data center quite substantially with a single unified architecture and be able to give them a good road map to cloud in a way that nobody else can do. And the midrange is the sweet spot, right? That's the place where it's the largest market segment and it is where we are most differentiated. So we feel really good. We've got to just keep executing. We've got the game plan in place. We're focused. We're driving good results. We just got to keep on it. And I feel really good about the progress we've made to date.\nKris Newton: All right. Thank you, Paul. I'm going to pass it over to George for some final comments.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. In closing, I want to again thank the NetApp team for delivering another quarter of solid results. It's been over a year since the COVID pandemic impacted all of our lives. And despite this challenging environment, we have successfully executed against our strategy. We have refocused the business and shown that we can grow both our cloud storage, our core storage and cloud businesses simultaneously.  We have improved execution and our increased sales capacity continues to yield positive results. And we've maintained fiscal discipline, maintaining operating margins of 20% year-to-date. As the recovery unfolds, I'm confident that we're in a great position to continue to capitalize on the growing importance of data and on our unique position in helping customers manage their data in the hybrid cloud. Thank you. Stay safe, and we'll talk to you again next quarter. God bless.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may all disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "content": "Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. We delivered another solid quarter, with revenue at the high end of our guide and operating margin and EPS above expectations. Importantly, solid execution yielded Q3 billings of $1.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year. This is our third straight quarter of year-over-year billings growth. In Q3, net revenue of $1.47 billion increased 5% year-over-year, including 2 points of currency tailwind.  We believe our 2 key strategic focus areas, our industry-leading all-flash storage business and public cloud services, both continued to outperform the market. When combined, software revenue, recurring maintenance and cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 13% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. We ended Q3 with $3.8 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth.  As we highlighted at our Investor Day, all-flash systems carry higher software and maintenance dollar content relative to the rest of our portfolio. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue of $652 million was up 11% year-over-year, positioning us for share gains for the third consecutive quarter. Only 27% of our installed systems were all-flash at the end of Q3, providing a very healthy runway for our flash business.  Public cloud services delivered a solid $237 million in ARR, growing 186% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. We continue to see strong demand from our customer cohorts with Q3 dollar-based net retention rate coming in at 227%. Given the strong sales pipeline heading into Q4, we expect to exit fiscal '21 with cloud ARR of $260 million to $290 million. We remain excited about our expanding cloud product road map, which includes continued co-development and deep R&D partnerships with the public cloud partners.  As we head into fiscal '22, we are investing in additional cloud sales capacity to support our expanding product road map and our partners' go-to-market motion. We remain confident in our ability to deliver $1 billion in cloud ARR in fiscal '25.  Total product revenue of $775 million decreased approximately 2% year-over-year. As George noted, in the quarter, we saw good engagement from enterprise accounts, particularly in the Americas, where the sales capacity added last year is paying dividends. Consistent with the growth we delivered in Q2, software product revenue of $428 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio.  Recurring maintenance and cloud revenue of $627 million was an all-time company high and was up 13% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. To help with your modeling of maintenance, please note Q3 includes a $7 million year-to-date adjustment from hardware maintenance revenue to software maintenance revenue. To be clear, this adjustment did not impact total maintenance revenue in the quarter.  Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high end of guidance. Product gross margin was 53.4% and consistent with our expectations. Our recurring maintenance, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us with gross margin of 82.9%.  Q3 operating expenses of $668 million were in line with our expectations. Operating margin of 21.9% and EPS of $1.10 were both nicely ahead of our guidance, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Cash flow from operations was $373 million and free cash flow was $341 million, representing 23% of revenue. Year-to-date free cash flow of $650 million is up 13% year-over-year. We expect operating cash flow to grow double digits for the full fiscal year.  During Q3, we reinitiated our share repurchase program, buying back $50 million in stock. During the quarter, we also paid out $107 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $157 million to shareholders in Q3, representing 46% of free cash flow. We closed Q3 with $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments.  Now to guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.44 billion and $1.54 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 6% increase in revenues year-over-year and includes 3 points of currency tailwind. Given our growing confidence in the business, we narrowed the revenue range to $100 million. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to range between 21% and 22% in Q4. Assumed in this guidance, our operating expenses of $675 million to $685 million.  Given the magnitude of our cloud opportunity, we plan to pull forward investments in both sales capacity and our product road map, positioning our cloud services for continued rapid growth heading into fiscal '22. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%. And we expect earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.06 and $1.14 per share. Assumed in this guidance is interest expense of $15 million.  In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for continued execution and commitment in delivering another outstanding quarter. We remain incredibly well positioned to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? So thanks, George. Katy, it's Mike. The 1 thing I'd add, too, is when you take a look at the guide, keep in mind that on a year-to-date basis, billings are up and that's really what we are focusing you folks on, about 7%, and revenue, when you adjust for the 14th week, is about three. So embedded in that guidance is still a pretty significant growth in billings, which to us is the leading indicator of business with our customers. It's Mike. So I'll answer that in two ways. One is we did -- obviously, in the first half, we saw significantly higher NAND prices. They have modulated a bit and came back to, I'll call it, relatively flat in Q3. We do expect it to be a tailwind to us slightly in Q -- our Q4.  Looking into '22, I think you'll see that continue. We are starting to see some of the demand pick up, especially in the second half of next year, especially around mobile and hyperscalers as well. As you all know, mobile is 30%, 40% of that business. So we expect in the second half of next year for that to kind of reverse itself. Also, keep in mind, DRAM prices are up quite a bit for us. It's not nearly the percentage of component cost but that offsets a little bit. And for us, QLC, look, we're just getting started with that so there's not much of an impact, I'll call it, in the near term. Steven, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So yes, we talked a lot in Q2 about the ASF, all-flash systems being driven by high end. And when we gave our guidance for Q3, we talked about, hey, we thought that would normalize a little bit and that's exactly what happened. So we had another very strong quarter in all-flash systems.  But there's a little bit more, I'll call it, normally distributed between low, mid and high, and that's what we saw. And I think you can see that in the product margin. And then, again, they were helped a little bit by lower NAND costs. So it came in pretty much what we expected, much more normal distribution. And that's also what we're expecting going into Q4. Again, it's tough for us to do demand shaping of those because of the great flexibility in our products, our customers can do different configurations to still achieve that performance. So we expect it to be pretty normal and similar to Q3. Ananda, it's Mike. So I think a little bit different than what we did last year was when we did a really great thing by bringing on the 200 sales folks. For us, this is just much more continued investment in that business. And I think that you'll see it more or less just play right into the P&L, as we've talked about, continued great growth in that business. So our goal is to continue to add sales capacity in line with that revenue growth to continue to drive it. So I wouldn't expect to see any kind of a bump on margins, specifically related to that. Yes. So if you bifurcate the different revenue numbers, and keep in mind, Sidney, that, that was, if you look at total maintenance, there was no impact to that. So as we look to Q4, we would expect to see maintenance continue to be strong in the quarter. I think sequentially, you saw maintenance actually drop a little bit. We would expect to see it grow slightly; cloud continue to grow; and then product revenue likely growing or similar levels to what we've seen in Q1, 2 and 3.  And this goes back to Katy's question because again, I just want to keep talking about this is, keep in mind that billings growth has been 6%, 10% and 6% in the first three quarters. Product growth over that time when you back out the 14th week as an average about 3%. So mix matters here a lot. And so to that point and to the earlier question on maintenance, we do expect to see continued growth in maintenance as we do more off-line systems, continued growth in cloud and product revenue will be a result really of the mix in all-flash. Hopefully, that helps. Yes. So if we take a look at new versus existing accounts, as George talked about, we really look at the public cloud business as being the driver of new customers for us and we've seen that. In addition, when you look at the dollar-based net retention, but obviously, our existing customers, we're seeing great growth there as well. One of the nice things about the cloud business is from a margin perspective, it's not going to vary that much in terms of new versus existing. Certainly, existing customers that have more than 1 product, you'll start to see some margin expansion there as well.  But as we look across new versus existing, I don't think there's a material difference there. However, I think that will help expand those margins as we go forward. We've talked about our driver in terms of driving gross margins in the cloud business. Especially as they take on more than 1 product, more data services and more solutions, that will certainly help us scale that business at a higher margin. Rod, it's Mike. I'll take the first part and then George will jump in on the second one. So as we -- so when we looked at the semi supply chain, they have lots of news and noise out there on that one. We don't expect there to be any impact for Q4. As we look into next year, for us, it's hopefully not as much of a P&L impact. We will likely, like other folks, go buy ahead a little bit to make sure that we have enough of that supply. We had 19x inventory turns. We've talked about this back when I first started last year.  I intend to see that come down a little bit. It's the prudent thing to do, given the cost of capital to make sure we have that supply. So I would expect it to impact more of the balance sheet than the P&L. But certainly, we'll keep you up to speed as we go through this. Yes. Wamsi, it's Mike. So on that, as we just talked a couple of minutes ago, we just expect to continue to invest in the cloud business as we see the opportunity and we clearly see a great opportunity. And that's in sales and in R&D to make sure we're moving the product road map forward. So I don't think, again, you'll see a bump or a reduction in the margins as it relates to that. The goal is to continue to invest in that as we go forward.  But we haven't -- we'll talk to you about where we think we'll finish next year when we get into fiscal '22. But we think that this is -- as you know, George and I have all talked about, hey, disciplined spending around OpEx. Disciplined spending for us also means we want to invest where we see a return and we absolutely see a return on those dollars. Yes, absolutely. I'd love to talk about cash. So say, 2 things on cash, Wamsi. One is, keep in mind that compared to last year, we paid virtually all of our U.S. federal taxes in Q2 of last year. So let's talk about year-to-date. The margins were great in this quarter. I think it was 23%. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow is up 13% year-over-year. Also keep in mind that in that number in fiscal '21, we've also paid about $75 million of taxes related to the IP transfer from the spot acquisition. So it's actually a little bit stronger than that.  As George talked about, our DSOs were super strong. They were 49 days, below -- anytime you get below 50, it's great. So linearity certainly helped our invoicing and our collections in the quarter. But yes, very strong free cash flow results, feel really good about that on a year-to-date basis. Yes. Just to keep going on that path, Jim, as George talked about, we do see that path. We don't expect to see the kind of increases that we saw, I think, earlier in the first half. Supply and demand will certainly dictate that. The other thing to keep in mind, too, and this is why we've talked about this so much, I will always push you to look at total gross margins because also, hey, cloud billings, not impacted by it. The more we do renewals, which is a huge part of our business, and it's been a great success story also helps as well. So from a financial perspective, this is something we look at, sure. But there are so many other things, too, that drive it.  Keep in mind, NAND may go up, DRAM may go down, something else may move around. We have a great supply chain team. They're looking at it all the time in terms of what it means financially. But again, we don't know going into next year where in the final supply and demand will end. We'll certainly keep you up-to-date every quarter. Yes. Keep going on that path, and we talked about this at Investor Day. We do expect this to come back, call it, industry norms, if that's, call it, 110, 120, 130. Very importantly, once you get to $1 billion and you that, certainly, we want it to continue to be a driver of new customers. But gosh, that upsell, cross-sell renewal, that motion is so critical. That's actually part of the sales investment that we're making is to make sure we have that great support team that can go in there and help our customers once they sign up for those services. And there's a lot of great examples of companies that do that well. So we do expect, in conjunction with getting there, that we'll be able to continue to drive great retention but it will come down to the industry norms over time."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks, Kris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I hope that you and your loved ones have stayed safe and healthy since the last time we spoke. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another strong quarter with our third consecutive quarter of revenue and billings growth despite the challenging environment. In the third quarter, our team delivered revenues at the top of our guidance range and operating margin and EPS above the high end of our expectations.  Our performance in Q3 was broad-based, with notable strength in Americas enterprise. The incremental sales capacity we added in FY '20 continues to pay off. Additionally, our Run to NetApp competitive takeout program is delivering continued success as we gain share and displace competitors' installed bases. Most importantly, this quarter, we once again demonstrated our ability to grow in both of our key markets: cloud and all-flash arrays. As we have said many times, cloud is additive to our business, that what we do in the cloud helps expand our on-premises business and that our enterprise hardened software and experience provide a solid foundation for our work in the cloud.  Cloud services ARR grew to $237 million, an increase of 186% year-over-year. We saw good momentum across the portfolio, with Azure NetApp Files and Spot being the standout services, both delivering significant growth. We continue to expand with existing customers while adding new enterprise and cloud-native customers. Our cloud services dollar-based net retention rate is a healthy 227%.  Our cloud partners are asking us to expand regional deployments, broaden workload certifications and invest in go-to-market activities to support this rapidly growing business. We had a significant presence at both AWS re:Invent and at Google Sales kickoff meeting. This engagement helps us stay top of mind with their sellers and reach customers with our cloud value proposition.  We are benefiting as customers move more Tier 1 workloads such as SAP to the cloud. Our cloud volume service delivers the performance and availability required by mission-critical applications. To address the substantial cloud opportunity ahead, we are pulling forward investments with our public cloud partners, adding dedicated sales capacity and expanding our presence in additional regions. As we look ahead, we have a strong pipeline to support our Q4 target. Our cloud partner engagement and expanding product road map reinforce our confidence in our long-term goal of achieving $1 billion in cloud ARR in fiscal year '25.  Our all-flash business grew 11% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.6 billion. For the third consecutive quarter, we believe we outpaced the market, gaining share from competitors and converting our installed base from hybrid arrays to all-flash. At the end of Q3, 27% of installed systems were all-flash, giving us plenty of headroom for continued growth. Our all-flash arrays received accolades from industry analysts and customers alike. They integrate cloud connectivity with the speed and efficiency of flash to deliver a smart, powerful and trusted solution for the most demanding enterprise workloads.  In Q3, we expanded the breadth of our flash offerings with the introduction of the FAS500f, our first all-flash array leveraging QLC technology. The FAS500f is a highly scalable solution for deployments that support huge volumes of unstructured data such as medical imaging, electronic design automation and computer-aided design and manufacturing.  Our cloud services and flash systems are built on the same primary software foundation, ONTAP. This shared R&D foundation gives us significant leverage in our R&D investment. We are able to innovate and test at cloud speed while bringing new functionality to the enterprise data center at a pace IT can absorb. This shared innovation also benefits customers, giving them a similar operating environment and consistent data management tools on-premises and in the cloud. It also enables them to move their data seamlessly to the right location at the right price at the right time.  As I noted on our last call, NetApp is helping customers accelerate their digital transformations and put their data to work to elevate their businesses. Digital transformation is now a necessity, requiring speed and agility to respond to changing business conditions. Hybrid cloud is the de facto IT architecture at digitally transformed enterprises for the foreseeable future.  Having an integrated flexible data management foundation is critical to the success of digital transformation efforts. Because of this, data is growing in scale and importance. We believe that NetApp is a primary beneficiary of this trend. We are uniquely positioned to address customers' requirements for workloads that move to the cloud as well as those that maintain and modernize on premises.  Let me share a few wins from the third quarter to illustrate why customers choose NetApp to manage their data in the hybrid cloud. A global pharmaceutical manufacturer needed to overcome the compliance challenges of regulatory mandates while minimizing security risks in moving to the public cloud. They selected NetApp all-flash FAS to underpin their AI-driven health care because of our cloud connectivity and the ability to achieve petabyte scale, along with our unique data protection and data management capabilities.  At a leading global clinical trial laboratory, NetApp displaced Dell to host workloads for the company's AI labs. We won because of our performance, cloud connectivity and data management and security capabilities. The ability to leverage NetApp cloud services when necessary was critical to the customer's decision.  Calendar 2020 was a difficult year for all of us and I'm glad to have it behind us. I want to express my gratitude to the NetApp team for quickly coming together to deliver solid results by helping our customers thrive while working remotely. We see reasons for optimism for calendar 2021 with expanding vaccine availability and improving public health conditions. However, uncertainty about the new normal as well as the tax and regulatory environments remain. In uncertain markets, data is even more critical as organizations look to drive competitive advantage, and we are confident in our strategy and the strength of our business going forward.  Cloud and All Flash FAS fuel the momentum in our high margin software, cloud services and recurring maintenance revenue streams. This growth, coupled with our disciplined OpEx management, balanced approach to investing in the business and sustained capital returns will create significant long-term shareholder value.  The new NetApp is a cloud-led software company and it's built on a solid foundation. We are a trusted partner to the world's leading organizations who are undertaking digital transformations. We have unique strategic partnerships with the world's leading clouds, including deeply integrated technology and go-to-market efforts. And we have a strong business model with a proven track record of turning market transitions to our advantage. As the recovery gradually unfolds, we believe we will be in an even stronger position as customers continue to turn to NetApp to help them solve the challenge of managing data in the hybrid cloud. I'll now turn it over to Mike for more details on our results. Mike? It's on the back of pipeline dynamics. We have a strong pipeline heading into Q4 and it's our fiscal year-end, so we have every confidence that our sales teams are going to make a real good push to finish the year strong. We've had a really good year-to-date in Q3. We saw organic growth of 123% in cloud ARR as well as total growth of 186%. And if you look at the midpoint of our range that we have guided to, the incremental growth in Q4 is the same incremental number as what we did in Q2. So we feel good about the finish. The investments that Mike and I are both making is to help continue to scale the cloud business. The majority of the benefit of that will really be next fiscal year. We've had three really good quarters. And if you look at our -- the finish to Q3, if you look at both days sales outstanding as well as inventory turns, we had a regular January, so linearity was good throughout the past quarter. Q4, the early signs are very constructive. The pipeline's strong. Our competitive position, I would not trade for anyone else in the market. So I feel really, really good about the opportunity ahead not only in Q4 but going forward.  I think what you see in our guidance is a bit of prudence, given that there's still a COVID environment. That while the vaccine availability provides incremental confidence, there are many other elements that need to come together to really give total line of sight to the new normal. That includes tax, regulation, new policy decision frameworks from the government, the stimulus package and other things.  So we feel very good about the year. We feel really good about the pipeline heading into Q4. Our competitive position is strong and differentiated as we have demonstrated with share gains for 3 successive quarters. I think what we are trying to balance is the really good confidence in our business with the fact that we're still operating in a pandemic environment. Mike, you want to add? So our overall installed base, which is a very large number, is growing in both systems and customers, right? So we feel very, very good about the opportunity. We've been in this business in the all-flash array business for many, many years, and we are growing the penetration of the all-flash footprint in our installed base by roughly 1% a quarter. And so there's a long runway ahead, a very long runway ahead of all-flash penetration.  What we are feeling very, very good about is the fact that we've demonstrated share gains. We are not demonstrating the rate of penetration of the market and the rate of share gains without winning net new customers and net new workloads. Yes, installed base continues to be an opportunity, but what I feel really good about is the fact that we are growing at the expense of the competition this year. I think there's two ways that I think about it. One is what's the aggregate market and then what's the percentage of the market that is all-flash. I think as we said, the aggregate market continues to get better steadily. We feel very good about the progress we've made as part of the overall market. We think that the macro trends this coming year should be better than what we had in the past year. There's a little bit of uncertainty with the specific timing of when everything gets better. But overall, sort of the bigger picture, there's no question that '21 calendar year will be a better year than '20.  I think within that, then we have gained share in the market. And within our overall portfolio, we see all-flash continuing to be a greater part of the mix, especially as newer technologies that make flash more cost-effective comes to market. So things like QLC, where we are in the early innings of. So as I said, we don't think flash will be 100% of the storage market. We think it will be a substantial percentage. And we think that, that transition affords us opportunity to gain share of new customers as well as to sell more software-rich, higher-margin configurations to customers. Okay. So let me get that in three ways. The first was, listen, we are certified for a broad range of workloads with Microsoft and Google. And they are -- we are pursuing additional workloads with them as customers deploy on our platforms. This could be software vendors that are deploying Software as a Service environments in the public clouds. This could be new types of applications, containerized applications, cloud-native applications. There are a whole new set of opportunities for NetApp.  And it is also certifications and deployments in parts of the world where we haven't deployed yet. So we completed the FedRAMP certification, which opens up the public sector market for our Azure NetApp Files. There's opportunity to do that with other cloud providers and other services, for example, our monitoring services in the portfolio. That's 1 set of things that we're going to keep doing.  The other is expanding deployments. So we've covered -- with some of the cloud providers, we've covered the large markets. Now we are starting to pursue parts of the world, for example, in Asia Pacific or Latin America that we didn't cover before. And so this is the ongoing build-out.  I think with regard to the sets of customer types that we see, we are really excited at the progress that we've achieved this year. We are acquiring customers at an accelerating pace in our cloud business. And once they join NetApp's cloud portfolio, our dollar-based retention rate shows up really strongly. They really like our offerings and they expand deployment substantially with us.  They are across a broad range of verticals, more in the less regulated than in the regulated industries where we are still going through certifications. The second is they cover a broad range of customer types, whether they are digital natives that never bought from NetApp, enterprises that were primarily competitors, customers or customers that use NetApp.  As our all-flash array business and our cloud business have demonstrated for multiple quarters in a row, cloud is additive to our overall business. And there are customers who start with us in the cloud, who then come back and buy stuff in the data center. So very pleased with the progress. The work that we are doing with the cloud providers will continue to expand in scale and scope and which is why, again, I feel really good about our long-term opportunity and the ability to reach the $1 billion ARR target in fiscal year '25. I think I'll just say that we feel very good about the finish to Q3. The book of business was balanced geographically. We drew out the Americas because of the fact that the performance was particularly strong in the Americas. As you know, our business is preponderantly enterprise, meaning small, medium business is a small percentage of our total business. It didn't perform badly. It performed well but it's a small percentage of our total business.  On the enterprise, I think what we saw was a continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2, which is stabilization of demand, normal linearity through the quarter, the sort of COVID strong segments, meaning the ones that were -- had business models that were less impacted by COVID like financial services or health care, continue to be strong demand sources for us, and we have really good offerings in that part of the market.  I think with regard to the outlook, again, I think as we said, many, many customers are starting to prioritize the new normal, what business looks like going forward. Digital transformation becomes a key part of any business's go-forward plans, and we are a big part of enabling a modern data foundation for digital transformation. So those projects continue to move forward. NetApp has really good technology to also help in hybrid cloud and cybersecurity projects, for example, protection against ransomware and other types of malicious data threats. And we saw a good pickup across the portfolio for that as well. We don't do a lot of business in the campus. I think we -- the primary part of our business is in the data center. And I think as I mentioned earlier, we saw a good pickup in -- throughout the year, people have been prioritizing big transformational projects, which they cannot defer because they don't want to fall behind their competitors. We saw priorities in hybrid cloud and modernizing data center environments using flash technologies. Those are our key bets and they've played out really well for us throughout the year.  I think in Q3, we saw normal linearity. So you can see from our DSO and from our inventory turns that we did not have a back-end loaded quarter. It was pretty steady linearity throughout the quarter and we feel good about that. That's a good sign heading into the rest of the calendar year for us. And so we feel -- we've done well. We've controlled what we can control really well. The macro environment is still uncertain but it's getting better. And so we'll take those and we'll continue to execute. We serve customers in multiple ways. An as-a-service offering, we have ways to support them on public cloud environments, which are as a service and instantaneous we have the ability to give them financial solutions and/or managed subscription solutions.  Our Keystone portfolio continues to make progress in the market. We have some good wins in the quarter. We've had some good successes against competitors and we feel really good about our offering there. It's early going. And we don't, unlike some of our other competitors, we don't think that the market has a single mandate. Customers want to buy in multiple ways, and we have the ability to meet those requirements in multiple ways. If I could add, as we mentioned at our Financial Analyst Day, cloud over time will become accretive to the margins -- gross margins of the overall business. We feel good about the progress we have made towards achieving that objective. We're not breaking out the cloud gross margins but we did make progress even this past quarter. So we're making steady progress towards achieving that objective.  With regard to Keystone, Keystone does not -- we have not seen to date an existing customer that has an all-flash deployment suddenly show up and say, \"I want to convert that to a Keystone deployment.\" These are usually net new environments and customers and/or net new customers. It's not like we're seeing our traditional deployed environment convert to a Keystone basis. And so these are additive opportunities to our overall business and there are healthy margin opportunities. With regard to the all-flash array number, we feel that we continue to take market share. I think that our portfolio continues to be the best 1 in the market. And based on other people that reported this week or today, we have taken share, right? So we'll wait for the rest of the roundup to come, but we feel really, really good about our position in the market. We've had 3 really good quarters. We're focused. We're executing and we're taking share. And I feel really good about our position, better today than even at the start of the year. Okay. Maybe I can start first. We have a broad range of purchasing agreements with customers. I think for some, there are preferred pricing agreements or master purchasing agreements where they are locked into pricing schedules where we don't have the ability to move pricing up or down depending on what happens to NAND prices. In the transactional environment, where there's no long-term pricing agreements, we are -- we take a look at the impact of commodity prices. We typically pass that through either beneficially or to disadvantage to customers. We're not trying to hedge it.  I think we are cognizant this time in the COVID environment of the particular challenge that our customers face so we try to be a good partner to them. As Mike and I both said at Financial Analyst Day, post COVID, given the continued progress of our all-flash array business, we see the ability to return to the mid-50s product gross margins. Listen, I think we have strong aspirations to grow our cloud business. I think we have every confidence that we have a multiyear game plan of achieving the $1 billion ARR number. I think we will give you the ability to sustain growth rates beyond that when we get to it.  What I'll give you a sense of is, cloud is a gigantic market, and the growth of cloud over the next 5 years will be much bigger than the growth of cloud over the past 5 years. So if you think that there is constraints to overall TAM, I just think that even the $1 billion ARR will be a small part of the overall cloud market in that time frame. So we're not TAM-constrained. I think our position in the market is unique, and we are continuing to execute on product road map expansions and go-to-market investments, as Mike and I have talked about in prepared remarks.  With regard to dollar-based net retention, I think it reflects the strength of our offerings. When a customer signs up and is activated and starts to work with us, they grow substantially in terms of their usage of our products, which is really good. I think both Mike and I see that over time, it should trend back towards more industry norms. I think 227%, which we had this quarter, is well above industry norms, reflecting the early phase of our cloud journey. Mike, feel free to add. I think it's all execution. I think we see a good -- a strong pipeline in Q4. It comes down to transaction execution, getting customers signed up, managing through the COVID challenges that customers are still facing, right? We have customers whose employees are not on site, who we can get to negotiate with only a certain number of days of the week. And that's what it comes down to.  I think the overall demand profile for our services is fantastic. I think we've added customers at an accelerating pace through the course of the year. And the types of workloads that we are deploying, these are mega-market opportunities, databases, virtual machines, file sharing, high-performance computing. So we're not opportunity-constrained. I think we just got to execute and bring in the transactions. Yes. I think, first of all, we have a massively larger customer base now than we did a couple of years ago, right? Even a year ago, we have a massively larger customer base, whether that's acquired through NetApp sales force, whether that's acquired through Microsoft or Google sales force or Spot, the installed base of customers to whom we can cross-sell and upsell products, like Mike mentioned, is massively larger at this point than it was a year ago.  I think with regard to what Spot brings to the table is they bring 2 assets to the table. One is that they are able to solve a large and growing customer problem, which is the problem of unused or unspent cloud dollars, and that is a topic that is near and dear to every CFO and CIO that I talk to, including Mike at NetApp. We're a customer of Spot and they save us a substantial amount of money.  We are able to use Spot not only to go after cloud-native digital native customers that never bought from NetApp, as well as to now find ways into new parts of large enterprises that didn't know NetApp and now get pleasantly surprised by the whole cloud portfolio. So I'm super excited.  They also have a really good offering for container-based workloads that, in combination with some of our storage offerings, gives us a really expanded set of differentiated capabilities for truly cloud-native applications. With regard to the competitive programs, our Run to NetApp competitive program continues to have really good results. Q3 was the strongest of the 3 quarters that we've had the program running. And it is a broad mix of customers. Given the mix of our business, they're mostly enterprise accounts. And we are winning new footprint, meaning new workloads displacing the larger legacy incumbents. So whether it's an HP or a Hitachi with their products, or whether it's Dell going through a transition of its midrange, we are winning against those players.  The strength of NetApp is our software differentiation. The fact that we can simplify a customer's data center quite substantially with a single unified architecture and be able to give them a good road map to cloud in a way that nobody else can do. And the midrange is the sweet spot, right? That's the place where it's the largest market segment and it is where we are most differentiated. So we feel really good. We've got to just keep executing. We've got the game plan in place. We're focused. We're driving good results. We just got to keep on it. And I feel really good about the progress we've made to date. Thanks, Kris. In closing, I want to again thank the NetApp team for delivering another quarter of solid results. It's been over a year since the COVID pandemic impacted all of our lives. And despite this challenging environment, we have successfully executed against our strategy. We have refocused the business and shown that we can grow both our cloud storage, our core storage and cloud businesses simultaneously.  We have improved execution and our increased sales capacity continues to yield positive results. And we've maintained fiscal discipline, maintaining operating margins of 20% year-to-date. As the recovery unfolds, I'm confident that we're in a great position to continue to capitalize on the growing importance of data and on our unique position in helping customers manage their data in the hybrid cloud. Thank you. Stay safe, and we'll talk to you again next quarter. God bless."

My name is Liz, and I will be your conference call coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, Ms. Newton.\nKris Newton: Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the third quarter fiscal year 2021, our expectations regarding future revenue profitability and shareholder returns, and our ability to return to growth, gain share, and scale our cloud business, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, such as the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the capital spending environment, as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, scale our cloud business, generate cash flow and execute our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K, including in the management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factor sections and our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. Thank you for joining us on our Q2, FY '21 earnings call. NetApp delivered another strong quarter with revenue, operating margin and EPS all exceeding our guidance. I am pleased with our continued progress in an uncertain market environment. The improvements we made to sales coverage in fiscal year '20 and our tight focus on execution against our biggest opportunities continue to pay off. We saw strength in all geographies with larger customers accelerating their digital transformations with NetApp. We will continue to exploit competitive transitions, the growth of the all-flash market, and the accelerating shift to cloud to expand our leadership position. It was a busy quarter for us. We hosted an Investor Day, held our Annual Customer Conference, and introduced significant new products and services which further advanced our Data Fabric strategy. I want to thank the team for their focus on execution and customer success, especially in these challenging times. At our Investor Day, we introduced our vision for a new NetApp, a cloud-led, data-centric software company. We are building the new NetApp on a strong foundation. We are a trusted partner to the world\u2019s leading organizations who are undertaking digital transformations. We have unique strategic partnerships with the leading clouds, including deeply integrated technology and go-to-market efforts. And we have a strong business model, with a proven track record of turning market transitions to our advantage. We laid out a plan to scale our cloud business while growing and gaining share in the storage market. These foundational elements fuel growth in our high-margin software, cloud services and recurring maintenance revenue streams. This, coupled with our disciplined OpEx management, balanced approach to investing for growth, and sustained capital returns will create significant long-term shareholder value. As you can see from our Q2 results, we are successfully executing against this plan. Cloud services ARR grew to $216 million, an increase of 200% year-over-year. Our cloud services dollar-based net retention rate remains very healthy at 207%. We are pleased with the mix of new cloud services customers and growth at existing customers. We saw continued success with our Run-to-NetApp competitive takeout program, an important component of our strategy to gain new customers and win new workloads at existing customers. Our all-flash business grew 15% year-over-year to an annualized run rate of $2.5 billion. We believe we gained share again in this important market. At the end of Q2, 26% of our installed systems were all-flash, giving us opportunity for continued growth by converting our installed base, in addition to winning new customers with our industry-leading all-flash solutions. Growth in all-flash drove momentum in software product revenue, which increased 14% year-over-year, and recurring maintenance and cloud revenue, which increased 11% from last year. As I discussed last quarter, we are learning to thrive in the new normal of working remotely with each other, our customers, and our partners. We held our Insight customer conference digitally, and it was arguably our most successful one to-date. We were joined by industry luminaries from our partners and customers, all talking about how NetApp gives the world\u2019s leading organizations the freedom to put data to work in the applications that elevate their business, and our commitment to helping customers exploit the opportunity of digital transformation by building data fabrics. We had a record number of attendees, including a dramatic increase in the number of prospects and first-time attendees. While we couldn\u2019t meet face-to-face, we had thousands of customer and partner engagements. The interest in, and excitement for our Data Fabric strategy and hybrid multi-cloud solutions was unmistakable. We bring enterprise-grade data services to the cloud and the simplicity and flexibility of the cloud to the enterprise data center. We are helping customers manage their data far more effectively for digital transformation and tackle the challenges of hybrid cloud. No matter where an organization is on its hybrid cloud journey, NetApp can help it achieve its goals. In the quarter, we announced dozens of industry-leading innovations to further help customers digitally transform to thrive in a hybrid cloud world. Our software-driven portfolio allows companies to redefine how they manage data, storage, and infrastructure, whether in the cloud or on premises. We introduced serverless and storageless solutions for containers, autonomous hybrid cloud storage and data management, and elastic scale for the modern workplace. New Spot services automate cloud infrastructure for containers through the continuous analysis of how containerized applications use compute and storage to automatically adjust the infrastructure to the optimal blend, saving customers costs and radically simplifying management. Cloud Manager provides a centralized console with full visibility and control to automate management of all NetApp hybrid, multi-cloud storage and data services, such as backup, tiering, and compliance. And with our Virtual Desktop Management Service, companies can rapidly deliver comprehensive cloud-based workplace solutions with continuous optimization of resources. We also unveiled the latest version of our flagship operating system, ONTAP 9.8. ONTAP is at the heart of our approach to hybrid cloud. We enhanced the ONTAP data services to provide integrated caching across the widest range of workloads and physical data locations, enable flexible, cost effective, instantaneous failover for business-critical applications, and support object storage with S3 protocol access. Additionally, we introduced new end-to-end NVMe systems, SAN-optimized systems, and hybrid arrays to give customers a broad range of price and performance options. Finally, we made updates to NetApp Keystone Flex Subscription, providing a fast, flexible path to a cloud-enabled data center with pay-as-you-go subscription for a cloud-like experience on premises. Keystone enables our customers to consume their Data Fabric with a cloud-like experience in their data center as a managed service in addition to the public cloud. Only NetApp is able to offer customers this flexibility. Together, all of these innovations better enable enterprises to accelerate their digital transformation and adapt rapidly to unpredictable business demands. Let me share with you a couple of digital transformation stories to illustrate how we are helping customers put their data to work to elevate their businesses. A leading U.S. healthcare provider is using AI solutions from NetApp to improve patient care and experience. Our AI control plane and Kubernetes integration enabled us to displace Dell and the early success of our initial deployment has resulted in expansion to additional workloads. We are now the foundation for everything from patient check-in to AI-based radiology and pathology. At a dominant U.S.-based retailer, NetApp was selected to support the work of 500 data scientists, with plans to expand to a 1,000. These engineers are using data to create AI-driven recommendations to increase sales and improve customer satisfaction. NetApp supported their need to quickly increase their online services during the pandemic as the foundation for an AI-based service so customers could virtually try new products. It\u2019s clear that COVID-19 has reshaped the environment. Digital transformation is now a necessity, requiring speed and agility to respond to changing business conditions. Hybrid cloud is the de facto IT architecture at digitally transformed enterprises for the foreseeable future. Having an integrated, flexible data management foundation is critical to the success of digital transformation efforts. Because of this, data is growing in scale and importance and we believe that NetApp is a primary beneficiary of this trend. I am confident in both our long-term opportunity and our ability to execute against it. Our unique position in helping the world\u2019s leading organizations solve the challenge of managing their most critical data fuels our ability to win in the market. We are committed to driving disciplined growth, extending our hybrid cloud leadership, effectively expanding our business, and ensuring that we remain well-positioned for the future. Our growing margin-rich software and recurring maintenance and cloud revenues support our ability to deliver value for customers and shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mike to walk you through the results of quarter. Mike?\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, we delivered revenue, operating margin, and EPS above the high-end of guidance. Importantly, solid execution across the company yielded Q2 billings of $1.46 billion, up 10% year-over-year. This is our second straight quarter of year-over-year billings growth. In Q2, net revenue of $1.42 billion increased 3% year-over-year, including a point of currency tailwind. Our two key strategic focus areas, our industry-leading all-flash storage business and Public Cloud Services, both outperformed our expectations in the quarter. When combined, software revenue and recurring maintenance and cloud revenue totaled $1 billion, and increased 12% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. We ended Q2 with $3.7 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Deferred revenue is the leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth. And as we highlighted at our recent Investor Day, all-flash systems carry higher maintenance dollar content relative to the rest of our portfolio. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue of $632 million was up 15% year-over-year, positioning us for share gains for the second consecutive quarter. Only 26% of our installed systems were all-flash at the end of Q2, providing a very healthy runway for our flash business. Public Cloud Services delivered an impressive $216 million in ARR, growing 200% year-over-year and 21% sequentially, with organic ARR growth accelerating for the second straight quarter. We continue to see strong demand from our customer cohorts with Q2 dollar-based net retention rate coming in at 207%. We are on track to deliver on our commitment of $250 million to $300 million in Cloud ARR exiting fiscal '21, and remain confident in our ability to eclipse $1 billion in Cloud ARR in fiscal '25. Total product revenue of $749 million decreased approximately 3% year-over-year. In the quarter we saw good engagement from both enterprise and public sector accounts as customers continued to embrace digital transformation and hybrid cloud projects. Software product revenue of $417 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by an increase in mix of our high-end all-flash systems. Recurring maintenance and cloud revenue of $599 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting over 42% of total net revenue. Gross margin of 66.9% was at the high-end of guidance. Product gross margin was 53%, up 160 basis points sequentially and ahead of our expectations. The outperformance was driven by better all-flash mix. We expect product margin to remain at this level throughout the remainder of fiscal '21. Our recurring maintenance, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us, with gross margin of 82.6%. Q2 operating expenses of $657 million were in-line with our expectations. Operating margin was 20.6% and EPS was $1.05, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Cash flow from operations was $161 million and free cash flow was $121 million, representing 9% of revenue. As a reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow. During the quarter we paid out $107 million in cash dividends, representing 88% of free cash flow. As you know, we paused our share repurchase program the last two quarters because of the macro backdrop. More recently, we have been encouraged by the stability in our business, broader macro trends and the recent positive results of several COVID-19 vaccine trials. As a result, we plan to reinitiate our share repurchase program during Q3, making progress towards our commitment to offset dilution from our equity plans. We ended Q2 with $3.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now on to guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.34 billion and $1.49 billion, which, at the midpoint, implies a 1% increase in revenues year-over-year and includes a point of currency tailwind. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to be approximately 20% in Q3. Assumed in this guidance are operating expenses of $660 million to $670 million. The sequential increase in OpEx is being driven mainly by the annual reset in U.S. payroll taxes and healthcare benefits. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax-rate to be between 16% and 17%. And we expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $0.94 and $1.02 per share. Assumed in this guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the hard work and commitment in delivering another great quarter. We remain well-positioned to take advantage of the market transitions George highlighted and capitalize on the big opportunity ahead. I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks Mike. We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to just one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTim Long: Thank you. I just wanted a little bit more color on the cloud services business. Could you just give us a little insight into how new customers contributed to that line? And also maybe, how much are we seeing that are kind of cloud only deployments not also carrying some enterprise business with you? And then just another part of that is that, is there anything we should look to over the next few quarters for that line as far as new products or new outlets to help accelerate that growth line even further? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We continued to be very pleased by many dimensions of our cloud business growth. I think we've got expansion in regions, expansion in certifications, for example, FedRAMP certifications, that allow us to serve new industries, new customer segments, and of course, the breadth of cloud service offerings. With both Microsoft and Google, we now serve a huge range of applications, everything from databases to virtualized environments, to Windows environments, and so on. And so there's a very large opportunity in front of us. In terms of our capture, we are capturing a broad range of customers, digital natives, who are born in the cloud companies that don't really have a data center, because all of their IT environments run on the cloud. We are capturing a substantial number of net new customers who have got a data center business, but not with NetApp, with our competitors, and of course, NetApp customers who are expanding their IT footprints as they deploy cloud-based environments with us. So we are pleased across all the dimensions of our cloud business. In terms of the innovation portfolio, we are innovating at Cloud speed, and you'll see continued updates from all of our teams over the next few quarters.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Tim. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nRod Hall: Yes, thank you for the question. I wanted to drill into the product revenue that particularly the software product revenue, which grew really well in the quarter. I know, Mike, you said in your prepared remarks that that was driven by high-end AFA. So I wanted to come back to comments you made George earlier in the quarter when we talked to you about the competitive environment. And just ask whether you think you're taking share there. What's driving that revenue growth? I also would love it if you guys could comment on whether there's any ELAs in that line. I just note that Dell storage revenue was down 7% here and you guys are down less so curious about your thinking on share and competitive dynamics.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, if you look at the results of all of our major competitors, [indiscernible], Dell, and HP, there's no question we have taken share. I think our product portfolio is the best in the market. In the all-flash array category, the richness of our software capabilities, the hybrid cloud integration, all has driven advantage in the all-flash arrays segment. The all-flash array mix was up in the quarter. And within the all-flash configurations, the high-end products which carry a substantial amount of software and maintenance, which leads to the growth in deferred revenue as a part of our business model. So we're really pleased. I think with regard to our sort of outlook, we continue to be really bullish about our portfolio. As I said, we got the best products in the market, uniquely positioned to give customers a hybrid cloud roadmap. And I feel really, really good about our position there. With regard to ELAs I'll have Mike comment.\nMike Berry: Thanks, George. Hey, Rod. It's Mike. Thanks for the question. So as George mentioned, as we said in our prepared remarks, the outperformance in product revenue and product margin, it was driven by the high-end flash system sales. And as we noted, we expect product margins to remain right around that 53% for the rest of the year. And as we talked about, on the last two earnings calls, we're not guiding any ELAs going forward because they are such a small portion of our business, which is why we're not breaking those out anymore, any longer going forward.\nRod Hall: Okay, great. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Rod. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is now open. Karl you may be on mute.\nKarl Ackerman: Yep. Sorry about that. Is there a way to think about how much of the sequential or year-over-year growth you saw in all-flash arrays was due to the implementation of your run to NetApp initiative versus upgrading your installed base? I asked because the 15% year-over-year growth rate is significant relative to peers in the context of your 9% CAGR you spoke about during your Analyst Day. And so I guess as we think about the sustainability of your growth rate for all-flash arrays, have you changed the way you incentivize your sales force for these run to NetApp initiatives or for upgrading your installed base all-flash? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I just want to begin, thanks for the question. I want to begin by saying that the 9% CAGR we referred to at the Investor Day was really market growth rates of all-flash arrays. We have continued to outperform the market. And as you noted correctly, we feel very confident we are taking share in the market. The products that we offer has leadership and performance efficiency, hybrid cloud connectivity, and a scale out architecture that our competitors cannot match. The run to NetApp campaign, which is a competitive migration program had another very strong quarter in Q2. And as we noted, we are focused on attacking the competitive product transitions in some of our competitors and taking share. And we feel very, very good about the progress to-date. If you look at the installed base, we're at 26% penetration of the installed base, which means that we still have a very large amount of room to continue to expand the flash footprint in our installed base. So net-net, strong quarter. We feel excellent about our product portfolio. We think we can continue to take share, as we said at the Analyst Day, and we're demonstrating that and our competitors have real challenges in executing their product transitions that we are taking advantage of.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Karl. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for all the detail around all-flash array. But actually, I have one follow-up trying to dig in. Is there any way you can give us qualitatively or quantitatively the mix of software in AFA in October quarter? And how does it compare on a year-over-year and a Q-over-Q basis so we can better understand the trends there and what enables you to gain market share?\nMike Berry: Hey, Mehdi, it's Mike. So thanks for the question. If you take a look at our non-GAAP supplemental disclosures, you'll see that on a quarter-over-quarter basis and year-over-year, the software portion of product revenue grew substantially. So on a year-over-year basis, it was up 14%. Commensurately hardware was down 18%, a lot of that was driven by the growth in all-flash. In addition, based on the booking under billings number of 10% and AFA growing faster than that, you can see that the other portions of our portfolio shrunk year-over-year. So again, that's going to put a lot more in software and as George mentioned, in support as well, because you also see billings growth of 10%, revenue growth of 3%. And a lot of that everything that doesn't go to revenue goes to the balance sheet, which is great for our future support revenue. So hopefully that helps in your question.\nGeorge Kurian: For the color on, why are we taking share in the all-flash business, I think there are two things there. One is we are more focused and executing better as we signalled, where we have really put emphasis on winning with the strongest parts of our portfolio against the biggest opportunities. And the second, I think, is COVID, I think has really accelerated in our customers. They're thinking about hybrid cloud deployments. And we have clear leadership in helping our customers build hybrid cloud architectures. I think those are the two elements in addition to having a really strong product portfolio that gives us the ability to take share.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mehdi. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess my questions on all-flash array as well, and maybe two parts it but, all-flash growth at 15% is fairly impressive. I'd love to understand the sustainability of this double digit growth as we go forward. And then assuming this mix keeps shifting towards more AFA, I'm somewhat surprised by the commentary on product gross margins will remain flat for the rest of the year, because I would imagine all-flash array have a better gross margin structure with the worse the rest of the product.  So just touch on the sustainability of this growth, we're seeing all-flash array. And then why aren't we seeing a better flow through on product gross margin given mix getting better? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I'll talk about the first part of your question Amit, thank you. And then I'll give it to Mike to talk about the product gross margin. With regard to the all-flash array business, we see, as we said that Investor Day, this being a multiyear transition in the storage market. We see that because we are still in the early innings of the technology curve in the all-flash array market. And we think that there are more technologies coming online over the next 18 to 24 months that will move more and more of the disk-based market to the all-flash market. We don't think that all of the disk-based market moves to all-flash. But as we said, a substantial percentage of the total storage market, meaning let's say 70% to 80% will be an all-flash array portfolio. We are in the early stages. We think that as we said in our installed base as an example, we are at 26% after many, many years of driving all-flash, and there's a long way to go, just to upgrade our entire installed base to all-flash. With regard to the ability to continue to drive share games, it's about focus, it's about innovation, and it's about meeting customer expectations. We think we're doing a good job, and we're going to continue to keep doing that. With that, let me hand it to Mike to talk about gross margins.\nMike Berry: Thanks, George. Amit thanks for the question. So, a couple pieces on this that I would focus on. As we talked about earlier today and in the prepared remarks, the majority of the outperformance in gross margin came from the high-end of our all-flash that was something that we had not expected going into the quarter.  Our guidance for the rest of the year assumes that that normalizes a little bit still growth in all-flash. But as you get into the high-end, you get even a little bit better margins because of the higher percentage of software. So we're forecasting now to come back and normalize a little bit still growth in all-flash, just not so much of the high-end mix.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Amit. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. Thanks for taking the question. I just have a quick one. Last quarter, I think you disclosed $44 million of ARR attributed to your recent acquisitions of CloudJumper, Spot and Talon. Could you give us an idea of what that was this quarter?\nMike Berry: Hey, Michael, it's Mike Berry. Yes, so we are not going to disclose the ARR from the acquisitions going forward. I will tell you that they have continued to grow. We did disclose that the growth rate of the organic ARR accelerated as well during the quarter. So still all good on the acquisitions. But going forward, we're not going to break those out separately.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Michael. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.\nAnanda Baruah: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on solid execution. And thanks for taking the question. Yes, this one just might be for both of you guys. Please give us a sense of how you guys reviewing sort of spending recovery right now, really you think sort of the industry is in that? And is there any way to anecdotally give us a sense of how much of the strength and performance has been from industry recovery sort of reopening the sales force initiatives. George, some of what you talked about, which is just the strength of the portfolio is folks looking at stand up incremental hybrid, just trying to get a sense of all of that, and really, to get a sense of how much more there may be to go from a structural sense for you guys, since you have so many initiatives going on right now. Thanks a lot.\nGeorge Kurian: I think first of all, we are in an extraordinary time. And, I want to applaud our customers, our teams for being able to continue to execute in such a difficult time. I will tell you that we have had a great first-half and that is primarily because of our focus and execution. I think the macro has been choppy, I think it's not going to deteriorate further, it's stabilized. But if you look at the results of our business against those of our competitors, there's no question we took share and we out executed them in a relatively tough market. I think within the customer base, I want to highlight three things. First, enterprise customers are beginning to move their businesses forward, because they realize that they have to transform to meet the moment and to thrive in the moment. And so the transformational projects, especially in the larger customers, are moving forward. Our business mix is key is tilted towards that and we are benefiting from that. The second I think is that, listen, we're pleased with the vaccines and the news about the vaccines. We think that the economy has mostly stabilized and it'll go forward. It should get better from here. But we are in the midst of a nationwide lockdown. We have lockdowns in many other parts of the world. We are in for a tough few months here between November and January. And so we're being prudent about our outlook for the next few months. We think we are extremely well-positioned for when the market turns as it will over time. Mike, you want to add any comment?\nMike Berry: No, nothing to add.\nAnanda Baruah: Well I was going to ask any update on how the impact of sales force has been able to make so far.\nGeorge Kurian: We said that we were adding capacity about 200 heads, we had provided an update that we have met our expectations of that hiring one quarter ahead of time in Q4, of fiscal year '20. Those heads are on board, they are driving really good results. It takes about four quarters for a wreck to be fully productive. So as we said, this fiscal year is the payoff for that investment. We're pleased with the progress and we're going to keep our head down and keep executing.\nAnanda Baruah: Great, thanks. Thanks, guys.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Ananda. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thank you. In your commentary, you highlighted the Keystone as a service model. Can you provide more color on the kind of traction you're seeing there from customers, the kind of customer mix on growth projections? And given that most of your competitors are offering similar as a service programs, how is the NetApp program differentiated? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think first of all, thanks for the question. Keystone is an element of how we offer customers the ability to have an outcome as a service. There are financing vehicles that we and other people offer, which are really procurement vehicles, we've always had them they are a part of our selling motion. And you know what, I think they are going to continue to be a part of emotion go forward. With regard to what we do with Keystone is offer it to customers who don't want to deploy and manage infrastructure, but just want to have an outcome as a service. We have many ways to fulfil that type of demand from customers. Clearly, our cloud solutions are the first and most effective way to meet those expectations. Because you can instantly spin up environments, and instantly spin them down. And you got them deployed on all of the world's leading public clouds with the best operating system in the world. The second is Keystone services from NetApp and similarly, Keystone like services from our wide range of service provider and managed service partners. So we have a good number of ways to meet that customer demand. I'm excited at the pipeline of Keystone and the wins we're having. They are enterprise customers. A lot of them are competitive footprints, take outs, and they are net new environments. So we're not in the business of going after brownfields. We're looking at net new environments, new cloud and customer deployment. So certainly you'll hear more about that from us over the next few quarters. Thanks.\nMatt Sheerin: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Matt. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. George, following up on your comments regarding the current environment, can you maybe give us a sense for the puts and takes if there is a continued surge, maybe here in the U.S. and then globally, what you've learned over the last quarter from a COVID perspective?\nGeorge Kurian: I think we do believe that the next few months, as I said earlier, are going to be a challenging set of months, right. I think you see that in the news every day. And what we are seeing is that companies have begun to move towards the new normal, right, they've optimized their operating models to deal with a hybrid or remote working model. They realized that they have to get moving on projects that were historically stalled, and so on. So we do think that they are better equipped to deal with the surge if there is one. The human challenge and the cost of doing so is high, right. And so we're being appropriately careful in our outlook for the next few months. We think that as we said, for the most part, I think, we see every sign that things have stabilized, they're not back to the new normal. There'll be improvements over time to get there. But I think sort of the further downward trajectory mostly stabilized.\nKris Newton: Thank you, George. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. George, just one more on the market share gains. You highlighted how all-flash arrays was sort of a stimulus for not just the upside in the quarter, but also driving more software sales. Can you just sort of talk about why you saw sort of the higher end revenues and how much you're able to sort of shape that going forward, as opposed to just benefiting from certain workloads? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think first of all-flash arrays have a higher mix of software, the software, in the all-flash array is what makes it so much more efficient, in terms of workload consolidation, infrastructure, management, automation, and so on. And our all-flash arrays certainly carry a very rich software portfolio. With regard to the mix, it really depends on the customer type and the customer use case. If there are deep consolidation environments, they generally tend to have a larger system, so that they can deploy fewer systems to consolidate more environments. If it is more of a project based mix, they typically have a more midrange type of model that they deploy. So it's really depend around customers. I think we feel very good about our competitive position across all the elements, midrange, high end, entry. And we're going to stay focused on selling the right solution to customers. I would also say what's unique about NetApp is we also have a really good hybrid flash portfolio that allows us to sell the right product for the right use case and customers.\nSteven Fox: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Steve. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMatt Cabral: Yes, thank you. Looks like you guys had a good quarter in U.S. public. Why don't you just talk a little bit more about what drove that strength and how sustainable you think tailwinds are in that segment going forward?\nGeorge Kurian: I want to thank our U.S. public sector team and our public sector leader. It was good execution in the public sector business. As we have said on prior calls, we have continued to broaden the range of our public sector business both to be more involved in program type spending that is distributed over the course of a year rather than at the typical public sector year-end in the federal agencies, as well as to grow our state, local and higher education business, which for us is a smaller percentage of our total business than a typical company our size. And I think we have done well across all those dimensions. We had some really good wins and slides. We have a broad book of business in the public sector, and I feel good about where we are. We have a new administration coming in. We will have to wait to see what the administrations priorities are. But I'm confident that our team will adjust and adapt appropriately. And so we will take it a good quarter at a time and we are pleased with the progress.\nMatt Cabral: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Matt. Next question. Our next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa. Your line is now open.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay, thank you. On a similar note, it looks like Europe was seasonally strong, maybe even a little bit stronger than U.S. commercial. So just any reason why in comparison to last year I know seasonality is changing a lot these days, from comparison to last year. U.S. Commercial was a little bit stronger. But you had a strong Europe this year.\nGeorge Kurian: If you just look at the first half of this year, the U.S. business has done really well. I'm pleased with the progress. I think, when I look at puts and takes between Q1 and Q2, deals move around between the quarters. So I wouldn't draw any unusual conclusion. I feel like we did see a much stronger book of business in Q2 across all the geographies. So I feel really good as we talked about in my prepared remarks. The breadth of the business is encouraging and we're going to continue stay focused and execute.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay. Good luck in the second-half.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks Louis. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. And George, congratulations to you and your team. If my memory is correct, I think your sales force was all in place about a quarter ahead of time, which means by now they're kind of fully on boarded, got their healthcare benefits, don't shadowing and are out there. And if so, it seems like the second-half of your fiscal year should even be stronger than this first-half. Plus, we're kind of getting hopefully through Coronavirus, with some vaccines and other countries opening up. Is that a logical way to think of things that the second-half of this year could even be stronger, or there are some things that kind of we should kind of pause or be aware of that just seems like everything's really striking and sync, and quite well at net out? So I just want don't want to get too far ahead of myself. But it seems like second-half should even be stronger than first-half.\nGeorge Kurian: Jim, thank you for your question and for the comments. Listen, you're correct about the sales force hiring having been completed a quarter ahead of time in Q4 of fiscal year '20. And as we said, we are enabling them, and it takes about four quarters to get a rep fully up to speed. We had a great first-half, we delivered our key strategic initiatives, we're growing all-flash revenue, taking share, continue to scale our cloud franchise. As I've said before, we love our market position. We have competitive transitions, the pipeline is healthy. The cloud platform is clearly expanding with the big hyper scalars. And as I said, we see the macro stabilizing the vaccine trials should give us all incremental confidence. We're trying to balance the sobering reality of what the next few months looks like for businesses for families, the lockdown not only in the U.S., but in many, many parts of the world. And so we're trying to balance the reality with the fact that our customer engagement in even in Q3 and compared with continue to be very constructive. So we're trying to do is take a prudent view of what the near-term looks like, given the uncertainty. But we feel very, very good about our position here year-to-date. Mike, you want to add anything?\nMike Berry: So I'd just add a couple of things. Jim, thanks for the question. As George talked about, we do feel good about the business. That is one of the reasons why we're reinstituting our share buyback as we look forward. As we do expect, it's still going to be a couple of months of difficult times, unfortunately for all of us. The other thing to keep in mind too and some of the great questions earlier is when we give revenue guidance, keep in mind as well Jim based on the changing mix of the business, that we do expect billings growth to continue to be ahead a revenue growth as we do more AFA in cloud. So also, just as you look at the second-half, keep that in mind as well, please.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much, and congratulations.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Jim. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Todorov with Longbow. Your line is now open.\nNick Todorov: Yes, thanks. Congrats on a great quarter guys. George and Mike, I think you guys are seeing nice progress on the Cloud Data Services businesses accelerating. I think you're probably tracking towards the high-end of your fiscal year '21 guidance. You talked about some of the factors, but I guess can you give us some update whether you the whitelisting that was a hindrance at [Indiscernible] file is still in place? And maybe can you give us some color on what percentage of the net new NetApp CDS customers have an existing on-prem environment versus what percent of those are born in the cloud?\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to the progress of the cloud data services business, we feel really good. I think the last couple of quarters have really demonstrated the progress in our business, both in our organic business which continues to accelerate, and the inorganic portfolio, especially Spot. We have a strong value proposition for customers, helping them optimize both compute and storage in the cloud for both traditional workloads, as well as cloud native workloads, containerized, workloads, serverless computing, and so on. So really good, broad position in the market. With regard to our business mix, as I said, we are getting a broad range of customers both cloud native customers who are born in the cloud companies, as well as enterprises that did not buy from NetApp that have data center footprints with our competitors. I think all of these are vehicles for us to go displace over time or expand our share of wallet app customers over time. Mike you want to add any comments?\nMike Berry: No, nothing to add.\nGeorge Kurian: Maybe I can just hit on your comment about whitelisting. Listen, whitelisting is a capability that's put in place, it requires customers to essentially register before they deploy a workload on our service. And given the kinds of workloads that we deploy on the public cloud platforms, high performance computing, mission critical run the business workloads, like SAP, and mission critical database environments, like Oracle RAC, we are going to continue to monitor. We're making progress towards the removal of whitelisting, but we're going to keep it in place for as long as we need to make sure that our customers have less flawless customer experience.\nNick Todorov: Thanks.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Nick. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes, I wanted to better understand the sequential revenue in the hardware maintenance and pro services. So historically, I would expect that to kind of inch up Q1 to Q2. Now, I know it's composed of about 80% hardware maintenance, and about 20% Pro services. What can you tell me about that Q1 to Q2 and then your expectation for Q3?\nMike Berry: Yes. Hey, Eric, it's Mike. Keep in mind that Q1 had the extra week in it. So when you look quarter-on-quarter, that was about $40 million of incremental revenue that we recorded simply because of the extra week coming off the balance sheet, it was about half and half between software and hardware pretty close. So you need to when you look quarter-on-quarter back out that increase, or that amount in Q1, when you do that you actually see a nice growth still sequentially in hardware maintenance.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. And the expectation for Q3 that continues.\nMike Berry: As long as -- that depends entirely on the conversation we just had earlier, Eric, in terms of the mix. If the mix holds consistent with what we saw in Q2, then there would be really no reason to believe it would be different. Keep in mind too that $3.7 billion of deferred revenue, like most software technology companies, 80% to 90% of our maintenance revenue comes off their balance sheet, so you don't get a lot of impact in the quarter outside of FX.\nEric Martinuzzi: Got it. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Eric. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nVictor Chiu: Hi, guys, this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. A number of conversations we've had suggested that Dell's midrange power store refresh has fallen somewhat short of markets expectations. Is this consistent with what you've observed? And is this significant piece of the share shift that's contributing to NetApp's results?\nGeorge Kurian: I think a couple of things there. First of all, we continue to believe that the midrange modular architecture, like NetApp has, is the sweet spot in price performance across the entire landscape. There are customers that will buy a high-end architecture like a power max or our high-end systems, but the vast majority of the customer workloads are going to transition to a midrange clustered system. And I think as not only we have observed, but many of our competitors have also observed, the mid-range from Dell has not met expectations. It is an incomplete product. It is hard to build a new midrange system. And so it's going to be some time before they can mature that and make that a real system. And you bet we intend to take share from them during that transition. We have seen the execution and the impact of that in our run to NetApp campaign. And we're going to pour it on. \nVictor Chiu: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Victor. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital. Your line is now open.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes, thanks. Good quarter by the way. I wanted to pile on a question here for the answer to George, where you talked about confidence that shift to all-flash array was going to continue due to flash innovations coming down in the next 18 to 24 months. Could you detail what are those flash innovations? And then another question real quickly is that what are the pieces of add-on software that tends to attach more to all-flash array and hybrid arrays?\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to the innovations in the all-flash array market, there are more cost effective technologies coming in the all-flash arrays segment, like quad level cell technology that continues to erode the value proposition of performance drives, 10k drives that transitions underway. We think there will be more and more of that market that will transition to all-flash arrays. The second is with regard to the software contribution, what we do with software in the all-flash arrays is to make them much more efficient in terms of data reduction, data compression and so on. And the second is to allow them to protect their data in more and more ways given that you have a ton of data sitting on an all-flash system. So the economics of all-flash are benefited by using software based data management. And those configurations as a result, have a higher percentage of their value in software, then in a disk-based system.\nNehal Chokshi: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Nehal. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Just a question on component costs. I'm curious is what you're seeing HP and it's not necessarily at exact overlap, obviously, but mentioned that some of their backlog was filled with higher cost components as they're seeing some price increases. Is that something you're looking at? And how do you feel about the opportunity to pass through, some of that component cost increases that we're expecting as you go into 2021 and beyond? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Hey, Shannon, it's Mike. What we saw in Q2 is we did see higher component costs, specifically related to SSDs. We do expect in the second-half of our fiscal year to see some of that pricing pressure ease. So we do expect some lower pricing. And we do expect that likely will continue into '22. Now a lot of that depends on the economy. As you know, a lot of that of SSDs are also consumed by some consumer products, mobile phones, we're seeing a lot of that demand drop as we go into the second-half of our fiscal year. We expect that to go into '22. We'll see how the economy rebounds though. But overall, we do expect component costs to be a little bit of a help in the second-half and then hopefully going into '22. But we'll have to see all the supply and demand comes out especially on SSDs.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Shannon. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. George, you gave a few examples of customer adoption of AI use cases. Do you have a sense for what percent of new orders or new deals tie to AI workloads? And is this a driver of the strength in high-end all-flash array demand in the quarter? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you, Katie. We are focused in our game plan on AI in solutions that are tied to specific industries. I think in healthcare, we are seeing a good adoption of AI where the stretched employees whether they are radiologists or whether they are patient administration personnel are being helped by AI techniques. And we also are focused in manufacturing and in select parts of financial services on the use of AI. So we're seeing good returns from that. I think with regard to why we are succeeding with AI techniques and AI solutions is because video and audio analysis, image analysis for example is now a mature and effective AI technique, and image and video and audio files they sit on NetApp file storage, and so we're an excellent platform for AI for them.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Katie. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Chung with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nPaul Chung: Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. So just a quick one on free cash flow. So are we going to see large harvesting of working cap as we typically see in the second-half of the fiscal year? I did notice, less investments in working cap in the first-half relative to kind of past year. So maybe not as large the kind of seasonal swing in the second-half just your thoughts there.\nMike Berry: Hey, Paul, it's Mike. Thanks for the cash flow question. Always fun to get that. It's a question. Hey, so keep in mind last year, two big movers on cash flow to note that any aside in the numbers in Q2 of last year, that the tax payments were pulled forward really into Q2. We paid about $100 million more in taxes last year in Q2 than this year. I note that because we will still pay those, they'll just fall into the second-half. The other part is as it relates to working capital, as you saw in the cash flow statement, we did do better in Q2 and collections. You saw that in the cash generated by deferred revenue and ARR. So as long as billings continue at the level that we're at, I would expect to see that in the second-half as well. But as you think about second-half, please keep in mind those tax payments, that'll be the biggest swing factor on working capital.\nPaul Chung: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Paul. Next question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. It's Wamsi at BofA. Congrats on the strong quarter guys. George, it sounded like you're expecting some demand elasticity given the pricing advantages of QLC. Just curious, what gives you the confidence given that the last NAND pricing downturn did not really show that elasticity and NetApp\u2019s revenues actually declined. So what would it be that's different in this cycle that you see? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We are actually seeing that QLC first of all, is not in the market yet it will be over time. I think that what we are seeing is QLC makes the advantage of an all-flash array relative to a 10k performance drive even better. So today, there are customers buying all-flash arrays, when they are roughly three times the cost of a hard drive. With QLC, that number gets a lot closer to one and a half to two times. And so the advantage will be even more material. I think we got to compete to win share in the all-flash array transition that that drives, plain and simple. I don't think that it's going to not require us to execute. We think that more workloads will come on to all-flash, and to the extent that we executed that all-flash transition, it gives us a chance to pick up share.\nKris Newton: All right. Well, thanks, Wamsi. I'll now pass it back to George for final comments.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Thanks to everyone. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter, successfully executing against our plan to scale our cloud business while growing in the storage market. We are a primary beneficiary of the increasing importance of data and are uniquely positioned to help customers in hybrid cloud environments and with their digital transformations. I am confident in our ability to drive long-term growth, extend our hybrid cloud leadership and deliver value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Thank you to all of you. I hope you all stay safe and so do your loved ones and families. Have a wonderful holiday season. See you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, we delivered revenue, operating margin, and EPS above the high-end of guidance. Importantly, solid execution across the company yielded Q2 billings of $1.46 billion, up 10% year-over-year. This is our second straight quarter of year-over-year billings growth. In Q2, net revenue of $1.42 billion increased 3% year-over-year, including a point of currency tailwind. Our two key strategic focus areas, our industry-leading all-flash storage business and Public Cloud Services, both outperformed our expectations in the quarter. When combined, software revenue and recurring maintenance and cloud revenue totaled $1 billion, and increased 12% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. We ended Q2 with $3.7 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Deferred revenue is the leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth. And as we highlighted at our recent Investor Day, all-flash systems carry higher maintenance dollar content relative to the rest of our portfolio. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue of $632 million was up 15% year-over-year, positioning us for share gains for the second consecutive quarter. Only 26% of our installed systems were all-flash at the end of Q2, providing a very healthy runway for our flash business. Public Cloud Services delivered an impressive $216 million in ARR, growing 200% year-over-year and 21% sequentially, with organic ARR growth accelerating for the second straight quarter. We continue to see strong demand from our customer cohorts with Q2 dollar-based net retention rate coming in at 207%. We are on track to deliver on our commitment of $250 million to $300 million in Cloud ARR exiting fiscal '21, and remain confident in our ability to eclipse $1 billion in Cloud ARR in fiscal '25. Total product revenue of $749 million decreased approximately 3% year-over-year. In the quarter we saw good engagement from both enterprise and public sector accounts as customers continued to embrace digital transformation and hybrid cloud projects. Software product revenue of $417 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by an increase in mix of our high-end all-flash systems. Recurring maintenance and cloud revenue of $599 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting over 42% of total net revenue. Gross margin of 66.9% was at the high-end of guidance. Product gross margin was 53%, up 160 basis points sequentially and ahead of our expectations. The outperformance was driven by better all-flash mix. We expect product margin to remain at this level throughout the remainder of fiscal '21. Our recurring maintenance, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us, with gross margin of 82.6%. Q2 operating expenses of $657 million were in-line with our expectations. Operating margin was 20.6% and EPS was $1.05, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Cash flow from operations was $161 million and free cash flow was $121 million, representing 9% of revenue. As a reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow. During the quarter we paid out $107 million in cash dividends, representing 88% of free cash flow. As you know, we paused our share repurchase program the last two quarters because of the macro backdrop. More recently, we have been encouraged by the stability in our business, broader macro trends and the recent positive results of several COVID-19 vaccine trials. As a result, we plan to reinitiate our share repurchase program during Q3, making progress towards our commitment to offset dilution from our equity plans. We ended Q2 with $3.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now on to guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.34 billion and $1.49 billion, which, at the midpoint, implies a 1% increase in revenues year-over-year and includes a point of currency tailwind. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to be approximately 20% in Q3. Assumed in this guidance are operating expenses of $660 million to $670 million. The sequential increase in OpEx is being driven mainly by the annual reset in U.S. payroll taxes and healthcare benefits. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax-rate to be between 16% and 17%. And we expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $0.94 and $1.02 per share. Assumed in this guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the hard work and commitment in delivering another great quarter. We remain well-positioned to take advantage of the market transitions George highlighted and capitalize on the big opportunity ahead. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Thanks, George. Hey, Rod. It's Mike. Thanks for the question. So as George mentioned, as we said in our prepared remarks, the outperformance in product revenue and product margin, it was driven by the high-end flash system sales. And as we noted, we expect product margins to remain right around that 53% for the rest of the year. And as we talked about, on the last two earnings calls, we're not guiding any ELAs going forward because they are such a small portion of our business, which is why we're not breaking those out anymore, any longer going forward. Hey, Mehdi, it's Mike. So thanks for the question. If you take a look at our non-GAAP supplemental disclosures, you'll see that on a quarter-over-quarter basis and year-over-year, the software portion of product revenue grew substantially. So on a year-over-year basis, it was up 14%. Commensurately hardware was down 18%, a lot of that was driven by the growth in all-flash. In addition, based on the booking under billings number of 10% and AFA growing faster than that, you can see that the other portions of our portfolio shrunk year-over-year. So again, that's going to put a lot more in software and as George mentioned, in support as well, because you also see billings growth of 10%, revenue growth of 3%. And a lot of that everything that doesn't go to revenue goes to the balance sheet, which is great for our future support revenue. So hopefully that helps in your question. Thanks, George. Amit thanks for the question. So, a couple pieces on this that I would focus on. As we talked about earlier today and in the prepared remarks, the majority of the outperformance in gross margin came from the high-end of our all-flash that was something that we had not expected going into the quarter.  Our guidance for the rest of the year assumes that that normalizes a little bit still growth in all-flash. But as you get into the high-end, you get even a little bit better margins because of the higher percentage of software. So we're forecasting now to come back and normalize a little bit still growth in all-flash, just not so much of the high-end mix. Hey, Michael, it's Mike Berry. Yes, so we are not going to disclose the ARR from the acquisitions going forward. I will tell you that they have continued to grow. We did disclose that the growth rate of the organic ARR accelerated as well during the quarter. So still all good on the acquisitions. But going forward, we're not going to break those out separately. No, nothing to add. So I'd just add a couple of things. Jim, thanks for the question. As George talked about, we do feel good about the business. That is one of the reasons why we're reinstituting our share buyback as we look forward. As we do expect, it's still going to be a couple of months of difficult times, unfortunately for all of us. The other thing to keep in mind too and some of the great questions earlier is when we give revenue guidance, keep in mind as well Jim based on the changing mix of the business, that we do expect billings growth to continue to be ahead a revenue growth as we do more AFA in cloud. So also, just as you look at the second-half, keep that in mind as well, please. No, nothing to add. Yes. Hey, Eric, it's Mike. Keep in mind that Q1 had the extra week in it. So when you look quarter-on-quarter, that was about $40 million of incremental revenue that we recorded simply because of the extra week coming off the balance sheet, it was about half and half between software and hardware pretty close. So you need to when you look quarter-on-quarter back out that increase, or that amount in Q1, when you do that you actually see a nice growth still sequentially in hardware maintenance. As long as -- that depends entirely on the conversation we just had earlier, Eric, in terms of the mix. If the mix holds consistent with what we saw in Q2, then there would be really no reason to believe it would be different. Keep in mind too that $3.7 billion of deferred revenue, like most software technology companies, 80% to 90% of our maintenance revenue comes off their balance sheet, so you don't get a lot of impact in the quarter outside of FX. Hey, Shannon, it's Mike. What we saw in Q2 is we did see higher component costs, specifically related to SSDs. We do expect in the second-half of our fiscal year to see some of that pricing pressure ease. So we do expect some lower pricing. And we do expect that likely will continue into '22. Now a lot of that depends on the economy. As you know, a lot of that of SSDs are also consumed by some consumer products, mobile phones, we're seeing a lot of that demand drop as we go into the second-half of our fiscal year. We expect that to go into '22. We'll see how the economy rebounds though. But overall, we do expect component costs to be a little bit of a help in the second-half and then hopefully going into '22. But we'll have to see all the supply and demand comes out especially on SSDs. Hey, Paul, it's Mike. Thanks for the cash flow question. Always fun to get that. It's a question. Hey, so keep in mind last year, two big movers on cash flow to note that any aside in the numbers in Q2 of last year, that the tax payments were pulled forward really into Q2. We paid about $100 million more in taxes last year in Q2 than this year. I note that because we will still pay those, they'll just fall into the second-half. The other part is as it relates to working capital, as you saw in the cash flow statement, we did do better in Q2 and collections. You saw that in the cash generated by deferred revenue and ARR. So as long as billings continue at the level that we're at, I would expect to see that in the second-half as well. But as you think about second-half, please keep in mind those tax payments, that'll be the biggest swing factor on working capital."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. Thank you for joining us on our Q2, FY '21 earnings call. NetApp delivered another strong quarter with revenue, operating margin and EPS all exceeding our guidance. I am pleased with our continued progress in an uncertain market environment. The improvements we made to sales coverage in fiscal year '20 and our tight focus on execution against our biggest opportunities continue to pay off. We saw strength in all geographies with larger customers accelerating their digital transformations with NetApp. We will continue to exploit competitive transitions, the growth of the all-flash market, and the accelerating shift to cloud to expand our leadership position. It was a busy quarter for us. We hosted an Investor Day, held our Annual Customer Conference, and introduced significant new products and services which further advanced our Data Fabric strategy. I want to thank the team for their focus on execution and customer success, especially in these challenging times. At our Investor Day, we introduced our vision for a new NetApp, a cloud-led, data-centric software company. We are building the new NetApp on a strong foundation. We are a trusted partner to the world's leading organizations who are undertaking digital transformations. We have unique strategic partnerships with the leading clouds, including deeply integrated technology and go-to-market efforts. And we have a strong business model, with a proven track record of turning market transitions to our advantage. We laid out a plan to scale our cloud business while growing and gaining share in the storage market. These foundational elements fuel growth in our high-margin software, cloud services and recurring maintenance revenue streams. This, coupled with our disciplined OpEx management, balanced approach to investing for growth, and sustained capital returns will create significant long-term shareholder value. As you can see from our Q2 results, we are successfully executing against this plan. Cloud services ARR grew to $216 million, an increase of 200% year-over-year. Our cloud services dollar-based net retention rate remains very healthy at 207%. We are pleased with the mix of new cloud services customers and growth at existing customers. We saw continued success with our Run-to-NetApp competitive takeout program, an important component of our strategy to gain new customers and win new workloads at existing customers. Our all-flash business grew 15% year-over-year to an annualized run rate of $2.5 billion. We believe we gained share again in this important market. At the end of Q2, 26% of our installed systems were all-flash, giving us opportunity for continued growth by converting our installed base, in addition to winning new customers with our industry-leading all-flash solutions. Growth in all-flash drove momentum in software product revenue, which increased 14% year-over-year, and recurring maintenance and cloud revenue, which increased 11% from last year. As I discussed last quarter, we are learning to thrive in the new normal of working remotely with each other, our customers, and our partners. We held our Insight customer conference digitally, and it was arguably our most successful one to-date. We were joined by industry luminaries from our partners and customers, all talking about how NetApp gives the world's leading organizations the freedom to put data to work in the applications that elevate their business, and our commitment to helping customers exploit the opportunity of digital transformation by building data fabrics. We had a record number of attendees, including a dramatic increase in the number of prospects and first-time attendees. While we couldn't meet face-to-face, we had thousands of customer and partner engagements. The interest in, and excitement for our Data Fabric strategy and hybrid multi-cloud solutions was unmistakable. We bring enterprise-grade data services to the cloud and the simplicity and flexibility of the cloud to the enterprise data center. We are helping customers manage their data far more effectively for digital transformation and tackle the challenges of hybrid cloud. No matter where an organization is on its hybrid cloud journey, NetApp can help it achieve its goals. In the quarter, we announced dozens of industry-leading innovations to further help customers digitally transform to thrive in a hybrid cloud world. Our software-driven portfolio allows companies to redefine how they manage data, storage, and infrastructure, whether in the cloud or on premises. We introduced serverless and storageless solutions for containers, autonomous hybrid cloud storage and data management, and elastic scale for the modern workplace. New Spot services automate cloud infrastructure for containers through the continuous analysis of how containerized applications use compute and storage to automatically adjust the infrastructure to the optimal blend, saving customers costs and radically simplifying management. Cloud Manager provides a centralized console with full visibility and control to automate management of all NetApp hybrid, multi-cloud storage and data services, such as backup, tiering, and compliance. And with our Virtual Desktop Management Service, companies can rapidly deliver comprehensive cloud-based workplace solutions with continuous optimization of resources. We also unveiled the latest version of our flagship operating system, ONTAP 9.8. ONTAP is at the heart of our approach to hybrid cloud. We enhanced the ONTAP data services to provide integrated caching across the widest range of workloads and physical data locations, enable flexible, cost effective, instantaneous failover for business-critical applications, and support object storage with S3 protocol access. Additionally, we introduced new end-to-end NVMe systems, SAN-optimized systems, and hybrid arrays to give customers a broad range of price and performance options. Finally, we made updates to NetApp Keystone Flex Subscription, providing a fast, flexible path to a cloud-enabled data center with pay-as-you-go subscription for a cloud-like experience on premises. Keystone enables our customers to consume their Data Fabric with a cloud-like experience in their data center as a managed service in addition to the public cloud. Only NetApp is able to offer customers this flexibility. Together, all of these innovations better enable enterprises to accelerate their digital transformation and adapt rapidly to unpredictable business demands. Let me share with you a couple of digital transformation stories to illustrate how we are helping customers put their data to work to elevate their businesses. A leading U.S. healthcare provider is using AI solutions from NetApp to improve patient care and experience. Our AI control plane and Kubernetes integration enabled us to displace Dell and the early success of our initial deployment has resulted in expansion to additional workloads. We are now the foundation for everything from patient check-in to AI-based radiology and pathology. At a dominant U.S.-based retailer, NetApp was selected to support the work of 500 data scientists, with plans to expand to a 1,000. These engineers are using data to create AI-driven recommendations to increase sales and improve customer satisfaction. NetApp supported their need to quickly increase their online services during the pandemic as the foundation for an AI-based service so customers could virtually try new products. It's clear that COVID-19 has reshaped the environment. Digital transformation is now a necessity, requiring speed and agility to respond to changing business conditions. Hybrid cloud is the de facto IT architecture at digitally transformed enterprises for the foreseeable future. Having an integrated, flexible data management foundation is critical to the success of digital transformation efforts. Because of this, data is growing in scale and importance and we believe that NetApp is a primary beneficiary of this trend. I am confident in both our long-term opportunity and our ability to execute against it. Our unique position in helping the world's leading organizations solve the challenge of managing their most critical data fuels our ability to win in the market. We are committed to driving disciplined growth, extending our hybrid cloud leadership, effectively expanding our business, and ensuring that we remain well-positioned for the future. Our growing margin-rich software and recurring maintenance and cloud revenues support our ability to deliver value for customers and shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Mike to walk you through the results of quarter. Mike? We continued to be very pleased by many dimensions of our cloud business growth. I think we've got expansion in regions, expansion in certifications, for example, FedRAMP certifications, that allow us to serve new industries, new customer segments, and of course, the breadth of cloud service offerings. With both Microsoft and Google, we now serve a huge range of applications, everything from databases to virtualized environments, to Windows environments, and so on. And so there's a very large opportunity in front of us. In terms of our capture, we are capturing a broad range of customers, digital natives, who are born in the cloud companies that don't really have a data center, because all of their IT environments run on the cloud. We are capturing a substantial number of net new customers who have got a data center business, but not with NetApp, with our competitors, and of course, NetApp customers who are expanding their IT footprints as they deploy cloud-based environments with us. So we are pleased across all the dimensions of our cloud business. In terms of the innovation portfolio, we are innovating at Cloud speed, and you'll see continued updates from all of our teams over the next few quarters. Listen, if you look at the results of all of our major competitors, [indiscernible], Dell, and HP, there's no question we have taken share. I think our product portfolio is the best in the market. In the all-flash array category, the richness of our software capabilities, the hybrid cloud integration, all has driven advantage in the all-flash arrays segment. The all-flash array mix was up in the quarter. And within the all-flash configurations, the high-end products which carry a substantial amount of software and maintenance, which leads to the growth in deferred revenue as a part of our business model. So we're really pleased. I think with regard to our sort of outlook, we continue to be really bullish about our portfolio. As I said, we got the best products in the market, uniquely positioned to give customers a hybrid cloud roadmap. And I feel really, really good about our position there. With regard to ELAs I'll have Mike comment. I just want to begin, thanks for the question. I want to begin by saying that the 9% CAGR we referred to at the Investor Day was really market growth rates of all-flash arrays. We have continued to outperform the market. And as you noted correctly, we feel very confident we are taking share in the market. The products that we offer has leadership and performance efficiency, hybrid cloud connectivity, and a scale out architecture that our competitors cannot match. The run to NetApp campaign, which is a competitive migration program had another very strong quarter in Q2. And as we noted, we are focused on attacking the competitive product transitions in some of our competitors and taking share. And we feel very, very good about the progress to-date. If you look at the installed base, we're at 26% penetration of the installed base, which means that we still have a very large amount of room to continue to expand the flash footprint in our installed base. So net-net, strong quarter. We feel excellent about our product portfolio. We think we can continue to take share, as we said at the Analyst Day, and we're demonstrating that and our competitors have real challenges in executing their product transitions that we are taking advantage of. For the color on, why are we taking share in the all-flash business, I think there are two things there. One is we are more focused and executing better as we signalled, where we have really put emphasis on winning with the strongest parts of our portfolio against the biggest opportunities. And the second, I think, is COVID, I think has really accelerated in our customers. They're thinking about hybrid cloud deployments. And we have clear leadership in helping our customers build hybrid cloud architectures. I think those are the two elements in addition to having a really strong product portfolio that gives us the ability to take share. I'll talk about the first part of your question Amit, thank you. And then I'll give it to Mike to talk about the product gross margin. With regard to the all-flash array business, we see, as we said that Investor Day, this being a multiyear transition in the storage market. We see that because we are still in the early innings of the technology curve in the all-flash array market. And we think that there are more technologies coming online over the next 18 to 24 months that will move more and more of the disk-based market to the all-flash market. We don't think that all of the disk-based market moves to all-flash. But as we said, a substantial percentage of the total storage market, meaning let's say 70% to 80% will be an all-flash array portfolio. We are in the early stages. We think that as we said in our installed base as an example, we are at 26% after many, many years of driving all-flash, and there's a long way to go, just to upgrade our entire installed base to all-flash. With regard to the ability to continue to drive share games, it's about focus, it's about innovation, and it's about meeting customer expectations. We think we're doing a good job, and we're going to continue to keep doing that. With that, let me hand it to Mike to talk about gross margins. I think first of all, we are in an extraordinary time. And, I want to applaud our customers, our teams for being able to continue to execute in such a difficult time. I will tell you that we have had a great first-half and that is primarily because of our focus and execution. I think the macro has been choppy, I think it's not going to deteriorate further, it's stabilized. But if you look at the results of our business against those of our competitors, there's no question we took share and we out executed them in a relatively tough market. I think within the customer base, I want to highlight three things. First, enterprise customers are beginning to move their businesses forward, because they realize that they have to transform to meet the moment and to thrive in the moment. And so the transformational projects, especially in the larger customers, are moving forward. Our business mix is key is tilted towards that and we are benefiting from that. The second I think is that, listen, we're pleased with the vaccines and the news about the vaccines. We think that the economy has mostly stabilized and it'll go forward. It should get better from here. But we are in the midst of a nationwide lockdown. We have lockdowns in many other parts of the world. We are in for a tough few months here between November and January. And so we're being prudent about our outlook for the next few months. We think we are extremely well-positioned for when the market turns as it will over time. Mike, you want to add any comment? We said that we were adding capacity about 200 heads, we had provided an update that we have met our expectations of that hiring one quarter ahead of time in Q4, of fiscal year '20. Those heads are on board, they are driving really good results. It takes about four quarters for a wreck to be fully productive. So as we said, this fiscal year is the payoff for that investment. We're pleased with the progress and we're going to keep our head down and keep executing. I think first of all, thanks for the question. Keystone is an element of how we offer customers the ability to have an outcome as a service. There are financing vehicles that we and other people offer, which are really procurement vehicles, we've always had them they are a part of our selling motion. And you know what, I think they are going to continue to be a part of emotion go forward. With regard to what we do with Keystone is offer it to customers who don't want to deploy and manage infrastructure, but just want to have an outcome as a service. We have many ways to fulfil that type of demand from customers. Clearly, our cloud solutions are the first and most effective way to meet those expectations. Because you can instantly spin up environments, and instantly spin them down. And you got them deployed on all of the world's leading public clouds with the best operating system in the world. The second is Keystone services from NetApp and similarly, Keystone like services from our wide range of service provider and managed service partners. So we have a good number of ways to meet that customer demand. I'm excited at the pipeline of Keystone and the wins we're having. They are enterprise customers. A lot of them are competitive footprints, take outs, and they are net new environments. So we're not in the business of going after brownfields. We're looking at net new environments, new cloud and customer deployment. So certainly you'll hear more about that from us over the next few quarters. Thanks. I think we do believe that the next few months, as I said earlier, are going to be a challenging set of months, right. I think you see that in the news every day. And what we are seeing is that companies have begun to move towards the new normal, right, they've optimized their operating models to deal with a hybrid or remote working model. They realized that they have to get moving on projects that were historically stalled, and so on. So we do think that they are better equipped to deal with the surge if there is one. The human challenge and the cost of doing so is high, right. And so we're being appropriately careful in our outlook for the next few months. We think that as we said, for the most part, I think, we see every sign that things have stabilized, they're not back to the new normal. There'll be improvements over time to get there. But I think sort of the further downward trajectory mostly stabilized. I think first of all-flash arrays have a higher mix of software, the software, in the all-flash array is what makes it so much more efficient, in terms of workload consolidation, infrastructure, management, automation, and so on. And our all-flash arrays certainly carry a very rich software portfolio. With regard to the mix, it really depends on the customer type and the customer use case. If there are deep consolidation environments, they generally tend to have a larger system, so that they can deploy fewer systems to consolidate more environments. If it is more of a project based mix, they typically have a more midrange type of model that they deploy. So it's really depend around customers. I think we feel very good about our competitive position across all the elements, midrange, high end, entry. And we're going to stay focused on selling the right solution to customers. I would also say what's unique about NetApp is we also have a really good hybrid flash portfolio that allows us to sell the right product for the right use case and customers. I want to thank our U.S. public sector team and our public sector leader. It was good execution in the public sector business. As we have said on prior calls, we have continued to broaden the range of our public sector business both to be more involved in program type spending that is distributed over the course of a year rather than at the typical public sector year-end in the federal agencies, as well as to grow our state, local and higher education business, which for us is a smaller percentage of our total business than a typical company our size. And I think we have done well across all those dimensions. We had some really good wins and slides. We have a broad book of business in the public sector, and I feel good about where we are. We have a new administration coming in. We will have to wait to see what the administrations priorities are. But I'm confident that our team will adjust and adapt appropriately. And so we will take it a good quarter at a time and we are pleased with the progress. If you just look at the first half of this year, the U.S. business has done really well. I'm pleased with the progress. I think, when I look at puts and takes between Q1 and Q2, deals move around between the quarters. So I wouldn't draw any unusual conclusion. I feel like we did see a much stronger book of business in Q2 across all the geographies. So I feel really good as we talked about in my prepared remarks. The breadth of the business is encouraging and we're going to continue stay focused and execute. Thank you. Jim, thank you for your question and for the comments. Listen, you're correct about the sales force hiring having been completed a quarter ahead of time in Q4 of fiscal year '20. And as we said, we are enabling them, and it takes about four quarters to get a rep fully up to speed. We had a great first-half, we delivered our key strategic initiatives, we're growing all-flash revenue, taking share, continue to scale our cloud franchise. As I've said before, we love our market position. We have competitive transitions, the pipeline is healthy. The cloud platform is clearly expanding with the big hyper scalars. And as I said, we see the macro stabilizing the vaccine trials should give us all incremental confidence. We're trying to balance the sobering reality of what the next few months looks like for businesses for families, the lockdown not only in the U.S., but in many, many parts of the world. And so we're trying to balance the reality with the fact that our customer engagement in even in Q3 and compared with continue to be very constructive. So we're trying to do is take a prudent view of what the near-term looks like, given the uncertainty. But we feel very, very good about our position here year-to-date. Mike, you want to add anything? With regard to the progress of the cloud data services business, we feel really good. I think the last couple of quarters have really demonstrated the progress in our business, both in our organic business which continues to accelerate, and the inorganic portfolio, especially Spot. We have a strong value proposition for customers, helping them optimize both compute and storage in the cloud for both traditional workloads, as well as cloud native workloads, containerized, workloads, serverless computing, and so on. So really good, broad position in the market. With regard to our business mix, as I said, we are getting a broad range of customers both cloud native customers who are born in the cloud companies, as well as enterprises that did not buy from NetApp that have data center footprints with our competitors. I think all of these are vehicles for us to go displace over time or expand our share of wallet app customers over time. Mike you want to add any comments? Maybe I can just hit on your comment about whitelisting. Listen, whitelisting is a capability that's put in place, it requires customers to essentially register before they deploy a workload on our service. And given the kinds of workloads that we deploy on the public cloud platforms, high performance computing, mission critical run the business workloads, like SAP, and mission critical database environments, like Oracle RAC, we are going to continue to monitor. We're making progress towards the removal of whitelisting, but we're going to keep it in place for as long as we need to make sure that our customers have less flawless customer experience. I think a couple of things there. First of all, we continue to believe that the midrange modular architecture, like NetApp has, is the sweet spot in price performance across the entire landscape. There are customers that will buy a high-end architecture like a power max or our high-end systems, but the vast majority of the customer workloads are going to transition to a midrange clustered system. And I think as not only we have observed, but many of our competitors have also observed, the mid-range from Dell has not met expectations. It is an incomplete product. It is hard to build a new midrange system. And so it's going to be some time before they can mature that and make that a real system. And you bet we intend to take share from them during that transition. We have seen the execution and the impact of that in our run to NetApp campaign. And we're going to pour it on. With regard to the innovations in the all-flash array market, there are more cost effective technologies coming in the all-flash arrays segment, like quad level cell technology that continues to erode the value proposition of performance drives, 10k drives that transitions underway. We think there will be more and more of that market that will transition to all-flash arrays. The second is with regard to the software contribution, what we do with software in the all-flash arrays is to make them much more efficient in terms of data reduction, data compression and so on. And the second is to allow them to protect their data in more and more ways given that you have a ton of data sitting on an all-flash system. So the economics of all-flash are benefited by using software based data management. And those configurations as a result, have a higher percentage of their value in software, then in a disk-based system. Thank you, Katie. We are focused in our game plan on AI in solutions that are tied to specific industries. I think in healthcare, we are seeing a good adoption of AI where the stretched employees whether they are radiologists or whether they are patient administration personnel are being helped by AI techniques. And we also are focused in manufacturing and in select parts of financial services on the use of AI. So we're seeing good returns from that. I think with regard to why we are succeeding with AI techniques and AI solutions is because video and audio analysis, image analysis for example is now a mature and effective AI technique, and image and video and audio files they sit on NetApp file storage, and so we're an excellent platform for AI for them. We are actually seeing that QLC first of all, is not in the market yet it will be over time. I think that what we are seeing is QLC makes the advantage of an all-flash array relative to a 10k performance drive even better. So today, there are customers buying all-flash arrays, when they are roughly three times the cost of a hard drive. With QLC, that number gets a lot closer to one and a half to two times. And so the advantage will be even more material. I think we got to compete to win share in the all-flash array transition that that drives, plain and simple. I don't think that it's going to not require us to execute. We think that more workloads will come on to all-flash, and to the extent that we executed that all-flash transition, it gives us a chance to pick up share. Thanks, Kris. Thanks to everyone. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter, successfully executing against our plan to scale our cloud business while growing in the storage market. We are a primary beneficiary of the increasing importance of data and are uniquely positioned to help customers in hybrid cloud environments and with their digital transformations. I am confident in our ability to drive long-term growth, extend our hybrid cloud leadership and deliver value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Thank you to all of you. I hope you all stay safe and so do your loved ones and families. Have a wonderful holiday season. See you soon."

I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work in the midst of this pandemic. Due to the global pandemic, the macroeconomic and IT spending environments remain challenging, consistent with what we saw exiting Q4. Despite these pressures, enterprises are prioritizing transformational and hybrid cloud projects, which drove our momentum as customers turn to NetApp to help them accelerate these plans. At NetApp, we work hard to be the best partner to our customers, a value that is even more important during these particularly challenging times. We continue to deliver heightened support for customers delivering vital public health and safety services, first responders and public sector institutions. For IT teams affected by the pandemic, we are offering 25 terabytes of NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud free of charge. We also extended our partner financing program to assist partners and customers in managing their cash flow. Uncertainty remains high, but we are moving into a new normal and adjusting to operate in a virtual environment. The majority of NetApp employees are working from home and have quickly built the muscle of interacting with each other, our customers and our partners remotely. Our sales teams are getting in front of buyers to meet and build demand. The number of Executive Briefing Center visits, now held virtually, increased by more than 50% over briefings held in Q1 a year ago. We also saw a doubling in the number of prospects in our virtual Executive Briefing Centers compared to in-person meetings last year. And our reinvigorated Run to NetApp competitive takeout program delivered strong Q1 results with good growth in future opportunities. The improvements we made to sales coverage in FY20 and the tighter focus on execution are starting to pay off. Our customers are also adapting to the new normal. Companies are moving beyond the initial response to the pandemic of operationalizing work from home. They are now looking to accelerate digital transformations to drive competitive advantage by delivering services and products remotely, reaching customers through digital means and optimizing remote operations and collaboration. The acceleration of digital transformations means more enterprises are managing IT environments both on-premises and in the cloud. NetApp leverages our rich data-centric software innovation to help customers thrive in this hybrid cloud world. We help them move applications to the cloud significantly faster than any other vendor, rapidly deploy business continuity solutions, enable remote workforces to collaborate and accelerate application software development. We bring enterprise-grade data services to the cloud and the simplicity and the flexibility of the cloud to the enterprise data center. With our data fabric strategy, we help customers tackle the challenges of hybrid cloud. No matter where a customer is on their hybrid cloud journey, NetApp can help them achieve their goals. As I stated on the Q4 call, we have two clear priorities in fiscal year '21; returning to growth in our storage business powered by share gains from our industry-leading file, block and object software and scaling our highly differentiated cloud services business. We will exploit competitive transitions, the continued growth of the all-flash array market, and the accelerated shift to cloud to expand the use of our products and services. We continue to make great progress in our cloud business. Customers are now beginning to deploy critical workloads in the cloud, which drives requirements for enterprise-grade capabilities. We bring nearly three decades of enterprise tested, data-centric software innovation to the cloud. Cloud providers recognize this and this is why they are choosing to partner with us. Customers also recognize this and this is why they are choosing NetApp to help them accelerate their digital transformation and cloud roadmaps. Leading with cloud in the marketplace, enables us to reach both installed base customers and new-to-NetApp customers. In Q1, roughly half of the new-to-NetApp customers came in through our cloud business. New customers, growth at existing customers, and an expanded portfolio drove an acceleration of our cloud ARR to $178 million, an increase of 192% year-over-year. In Q1, we acquired CloudJumper, a provider of cloud-based virtual desktop services; and Spot, a leader in compute management and cost optimization on the public clouds. In addition to extending our value proposition to cover more of customers\u2019 cloud spend, these acquisitions bring strong talent with cloud DNA to our marketing, sales and engineering teams, and they are driving increased interest in NetApp. More customers are coming to us because they are excited by our cloud strategy and ability to help them deploy applications and optimize compute and storage in the cloud. As I\u2019ve said many times, our cloud services make us a more attractive strategic partner to customers and help us gain share in the enterprise data center. Our industry-leading storage operating system software, ONTAP, is key to our success in the cloud and on-premises. ONTAP is the most powerful, most cloud-connected, and most efficient storage operating system on the market. Not only do we provide customers with a consistent operating system across data center and cloud to unify their hybrid cloud, we provide them with the flexibility of a cloud-like purchasing experience through our Keystone service. One of the key features of ONTAP is FabricPool, which allows customers to create policies for the automatic tiering of infrequently accessed data to a more cost-effective tier such as Azure, AWS, Google, or any S3 target, including our object storage solution, StorageGRID. During these uncertain economic times, customers are finding even greater value in our ability to help them take advantage of high-performance all-flash arrays while reducing total cost of ownership through automated tiering to a lower cost cloud or object tier. This and other industry-leading capabilities helped drive strong growth for both StorageGRID and the A-series all-flash FAS array. Based on the strong 34% year-over-year growth in our all-flash business, we expect we have gained share in this important market. NetApp is uniquely positioned to help customers unlock the best of cloud for their digital transformation. We are building on a strong foundation of industry-leading data-centric software innovation, trusted customer relationships and an open-ecosystem approach that is strengthened by partnerships with the leading public cloud companies who endorse our Data Fabric Strategy. With the ongoing pandemic, the near future remains uncertain for many companies, and no one knows when we will return to a more normal and predictable environment. Despite the uncertainties, one thing is clear. Data is growing in scale and importance. We help the world\u2019s leading organizations solve the challenge of managing their most critical data. In closing, I want to reiterate my confidence for NetApp\u2019s future. We have strengthened our leadership team, broadened our portfolio, and enhanced our partnerships. We are listening to the market and customers and will continue to respond to their requirements with speed and agility. We will continue to be agile in our response to the market conditions created by the pandemic while positioning NetApp to address the long-term opportunity. Our strong business model and disciplined management supports our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. We are tightly aligned to our customers\u2019 priorities and deeply committed to creating value for our customers and shareholders alike. Finally, I want to call out a couple of key events happening this quarter. I hope that you will all be able to join our Virtual Analyst Day on September 16. You can register from our Investor Relations Web site. Our flagship user conference, INSIGHT, will be fully virtual October 26 to 29. We hope you can tune in to hear more about how NetApp helps customers unlock the best of cloud. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mike to walk you through the results of the quarter.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George noted, despite the continued macro uncertainty in Q1 as a result of COVID-19, we delivered revenue, operating margin and EPS above the high-end of guidance. Importantly, solid execution by the sales team, in a very difficult environment, yielded Q1 billings of $1.15 billion, up 6% year-over-year. In Q1, net revenue of $1.3 billion increased 5% year-over-year, including a point of currency headwind. Our two key strategic focus areas; our storage business, powered by our industry-leading file, block and object software, and Public Cloud Services, both outperformed the market in the quarter. Our all-flash revenue of $567 million was up 34% year-over-year, nicely positioning us for share gains in the quarter. We remain confident in the growth opportunity for all-flash adoption. At the end of Q1, 25% of our installed systems were all-flash, providing a healthy runway as customers continue to embrace the cloud-connectivity and investment protection offered by our flash solutions. Public Cloud Services delivered an impressive $178 million in ARR, growing 192% year-over-year and 60% sequentially. Our recent acquisitions of Spot, CloudJumper and Talon contributed a total of $44 million of ARR as of the end of the quarter. Even excluding these acquisitions, the growth of our Public Cloud Services business accelerated to 120% year-over-year. We plan to provide an updated framework for our Public Cloud Services opportunity at our upcoming virtual Analyst Day. Total product revenue of $627 million decreased approximately 3% year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw growth in our largest global enterprise accounts as customers initiated digital transformation and hybrid cloud projects. To provide improved visibility into the value created by our high-margin software franchise, we are now breaking out product revenues between software and hardware. Software product revenue of $311 million increased 2% year-over-year, driven by an increase in our software-rich all-flash FAS. Hardware product revenue of $316 million decreased 7% year-over-year, as spinning disk solutions continued to decline. The engineering DNA of NetApp and the value we provide to customers and shareholders is grounded in software. We will continue to highlight and invest in this innovation engine. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $608 million was up 14% year-over-year and up 6% year-over-year when adjusted for the approximately $40 million related to the extra week in the quarter. These two recurring revenue lines comprised roughly 47% of total net revenue. When combined, software revenue and recurring maintenance revenue totaled $919 million in Q1, representing 71% of total revenue. We ended Q1 with $3.6 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 3% year-over-year as we continued to grow our installed base. Gross margin of 68% was up nearly 1 point year-over-year. Product gross margin was 51.4%, a decrease of 2 points year-over-year and in-line with our expectations. The year-over-year decline was driven by materially higher NAND costs and COVID-related pricing trends. We believe both of these headwinds are transitory in nature. However, given the uncertainty in the macro environment, we are cautiously assuming that a combination of these factors will persist throughout the remainder of fiscal '21. In the interim, we will continue to focus on reinforcing our strategy of selling on the value of our solutions. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us, with gross margin of 83.4%, up 1 point year-over-year. The margin expansion was driven by continued leverage in our support model and exhibits the strong margin profile of a business with a software and recurring revenue model. Q1 operating expenses of $673 million increased approximately 3% year-over-year, driven by the incremental $30 million associated with the extra week in Q1 and higher variable compensation resulting from the better than expected revenue and profitability. Operating margin was 16.3%, up 2 points from Q1 of last year. EPS of $0.73 was up 12% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $240 million and free cash flow was $188 million, representing 14% of revenue. Cash flow from operations included a one-time tax payment of $57 million related to acquisitions. Excluding this item, operating cash flow would have been $297 million and free cash flow would have been $245 million, or 19% of revenue. During the quarter we paid out $107 million in cash dividends, representing 57% of free cash flow. As we noted on the Q4 call, we believe it is prudent to pause our share repurchase program until we have a better sense for the timing and magnitude of the broader economic recovery. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 222 million, down 21 million shares year-over-year, representing a 9% decrease. We will maintain our cash dividend of $0.48 per share in Q2. We ended Q1 with $3.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. As you know, during the quarter we raised $2 billion in long-term debt. As of the end of the quarter, we used approximately $900 million of our debt raise to reduce our commercial paper balance and pay down 2021 senior debt maturities. The debt raise further enhances our already strong liquidity position, while also providing financial flexibility from additional domestic cash balances during the current economic environment. To be clear, even with this added liquidity, we will maintain our long history of disciplined M&A. Now to guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.225 billion and $1.375 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 5% decline in revenues year-over-year and includes 1 point of currency tailwind. As a reminder, the maintenance revenue benefit in Q1 from the extra week will not repeat in Q2. As a result, we expect our total maintenance revenue in Q2 to grow year-over-year while being down approximately $30 million sequentially from Q1. As a result of this sequential mix shift between product and maintenance revenues, we expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67%. We expect operating margin to be approximately 16% in Q2. Assumed in this guidance are operating expenses of $655 million to $665 million including $20 million related to our recent acquisitions. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. And we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $0.66 and $0.74 per share. Assumed in this guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million, driven by increased interest expense from our recent debt offering. As a reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow. This is further compounded by our annual cash tax payments associated with repatriation tax reform. Q1 earnings clearly came in better than expected. When comparing our Q2 EPS guide relative to the Q1 print, please remember the items I walked through earlier as they materially impact the normal sequential compares. As promised, we will be very disciplined around our cost structure. As outlined in our 8-K filing today, we are realigning resources and investments to continue to optimize our business to fund our biggest strategic priorities; returning to growth in our storage software and systems business, while scaling Public Cloud Services. Going forward, we will remain disciplined around our OpEx envelope as we look for reinvestment opportunities that allow us to position the company for long-term success. Also noted in today\u2019s 8-K filing is the departure of Scott Allen, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. I want to personally thank Scott for all of his contributions to NetApp over the past four years. He will definitely be missed. We wish Scott the best in the next chapter of his career. In closing, I want to reiterate our confidence in our strategic roadmap and our commitment to continue to evolve NetApp into a cloud-led company, building on our rich data-centric software heritage. We believe this transition, coupled with solid execution, will drive significant long-term value for our shareholders. We hope all of you can join us at our upcoming Virtual Analyst Day on September 16. I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to just one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot for taking my question, guys. I will stick to one question. I guess just a question on your cloud services ARR metrics that you guys gave out. It\u2019s obviously really impressive even if I take the deals out, I think it\u2019s up mid-20% sequentially, 120% growth year-over-year. Can you perhaps maybe help us understand how much of that growth do you think is coming from existing customers as they migrate to off-premise and kind of taking their ONTAP solution with them versus net new customers \u2013 net new logo wins that are coming to you? So is there a way to break that growth down between existing customers versus net new customers, that would be really helpful?\nGeorge Kurian: We saw growth in the cloud business from a lot of new customers new to NetApp where about half of our new to NetApp customers for the quarter came through our cloud business and a good chunk of the cloud customers were new workloads, meaning new wallet in accounts where we have presence. So the substitution of on-prem workloads to the public cloud was the smallest part of the growth of our overall cloud business. We are seeing the use of cloud increasingly for disaster protection and business continuum purposes. We\u2019ve had several wins during the quarter where customers combine our on-premise all-flash array business with a flexible disaster protection copy in the cloud. So we\u2019re very, very pleased with the progress in our cloud business. Our hyperscalers are helping us scale. We\u2019re getting new logos, new wallets in existing customers and building new architectures for customers as well.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Amit. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nRod Hall: Yes. Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to start off back to the CDS run rate and just ask maybe, George, could you just comment a little bit on Azure NetApp Files? It seems like as much as that\u2019s growing 120%, it\u2019s about the same growth rate year-over-year as last quarter. And I thought \u2013 kind of when we started this journey, I thought that the addressable market of that was quite a bit larger and I just wonder if you still believe it\u2019s a pretty big addressable market, is it blow on the come [ph] or is it on track with what you expected, maybe just comment on that. Then I have a follow up.\nGeorge Kurian: We\u2019ve always said that we are moving customers\u2019 most important workloads to the cloud. So these workloads are incredibly sticky once they\u2019re deployed in the cloud, but they require planning and deliberations before you do that. What we saw through the course of the quarter again was sequential acceleration of our cloud storage business where not only did our business with Microsoft grow, but our business with the other hyperscalers were also up to really good starts. We are seeing the software-based solutions which complement the high-performance Azure NetApp Files use cases growing nicely and our acquisitions are allowing us access to net new customers and new wallets, the compute wallet [indiscernible] desktop as a service wallet in customer. So I couldn\u2019t be more pleased about the progress. We will tell you more about the long-term expectations of our cloud business at our Virtual Analyst Day.\nRod Hall: Okay. And then for a follow up, I wanted to just double check. It looks like \u2013 you haven\u2019t mentioned ELA, so I assume in the July quarter there is very little or \u2013 that I just wonder Mike if you could just clarify the ELA number for the quarter? And then also connected to that, the core product margins in the guidance, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d be willing to tell us what you think the trajectory there is just so we can kind of get our heads around that? I know you made the comment on gross margins, but anything you can give us on what you\u2019re thinking on core product gross margin trajectory would be helpful? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Sure, Rod. So on the first one on ELA \u2013 so it lasted until the second question, so that\u2019s good. What I would say is we told you last quarter that we are not going to discuss ELAs. My comment there would be if we do anything of significance size, you absolutely will see it in the financial statements, you\u2019ll see it in margin and also now with us breaking out software revenue as a part of product revenue, you\u2019ll also see it there. So you\u2019ll be able to track that for any significant ELAs going forward. On core product, so we\u2019ve guided to a pretty consistent core product margin as it relates to the areas that we discussed, NAND pricing as well as COVID pricing. Given the uncertainty in the economy, we are conservatively assuming something relatively similar going forward. We do expect there to be a little bit of help on NAND pricing as we go through the rest of the year, but that\u2019s a little out of our control, Rod. It\u2019s really based on industry supply and demand.\nRod Hall: Great. Okay. Thanks a lot, Mike. That\u2019s helpful.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Rod. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nSam Reiff: Hi. This is Sam on for Karl. I was just wondering if you could give the puts and takes on the OpEx guide in context of the restructuring program that should begin hitting the P&L this coming quarter per the press release? I\u2019m aware that last quarter had an extra week, but I would have guessed that OpEx would have been guided a bit lower than what you did based on the savings. And then related to that, could you guys characterize how the heads that you\u2019ve been adding through the year are gaining traction or efficiency in this relatively difficult selling environment? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Okay. Hi, Sam. It\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll take the first one. So when you look at the guide for OpEx, the midpoint of the guide about 660, last year we did about 631, so I\u2019ll do a year-over-year for you is that the acquisitions will add about 20 million of expenses year-over-year. So that is something obviously new year-over-year and that\u2019s all three of them together. We will have higher variable pay. Last year from a bonus and a commission perspective, the accruals were quite low given the performance. And then that will be offset by about 15 million of savings from the restructuring. Keep in mind that that\u2019s only two of three months that we\u2019ll get the credit for. So that\u2019s your year-over-year walk on OpEx.\nGeorge Kurian: The second question that you had asked was about the productivity of the team that we hired. They are deployed and they are contributing well to our business. You see that strength in both for the enterprise storage systems in software business as well as the growing contribution of our cloud business. So we\u2019re pleased we\u2019re off to a good start and we\u2019re excited that the momentum that those heads add to our business.\nSam Reiff: Got it. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Sam. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. The first one has to do with some color on the October quarter. If I just take your commentary, it suggests that product revenue included ASA which show a higher decline on a year-over-year basis, especially when I compare to July they had only a 3% decline. Is that just a reflection of an extra week in the July quarter? And I have a follow up.\nGeorge Kurian: The July quarter did not include any transactional revenue from the extra week. We had about 40 million as we explained in our prepared remarks from the services revenue in the July quarter due to the extra week. With regard to the October quarter, I\u2019ll just say at a high level we see the October quarter relatively the same from a macro perspective and a demand perspective that we see in the current quarter. So I would say that you\u2019re looking at the business more on a sequential basis rather than a year-on-year basis. We have continued to monitor the market. I would tell you that it\u2019s hard for me to predict the seasonality of our business. And so we\u2019re giving you an outlook on a quarterly basis. And so far what we see in the October quarter is somewhat similar to what we see in the July quarter.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you for all the detail. Just quickly looking at the longer term, is there any way we can articulate an update on your efforts on Kubernetes? And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to explain at the Virtual Analyst Day, but any preview you can provide us.\nGeorge Kurian: Kubernetes is a technology that grows very quickly as the new way to deploy applications and manage infrastructure. NetApp has excellent solutions for customers who are building applications using containers and Kubernetes. We have two of those solutions that work in concert; the persistent storage solution both using our Trident software and Project Astra provide customers really capable application data management capabilities, and the technology that we acquired with Spot allows customers to really optimize the cost and the effectiveness of their Kubernetes application environment. So we\u2019re really excited. We have some state-of-the-art solutions that customers are adopting and we\u2019ll tell you more about it on our Virtual Analyst Day.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. You said you had two updates; persisting cash and\u2026?\nGeorge Kurian: And the compute optimization that we acquired with Spot that is particularly helpful in Kubernetes environment.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Mehdi. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nMatt Cabral: Thank you. Really strong inflection in all flash that you guys saw during the quarter. Just wondering if you could dig a little bit more into what drove that and then just how sustainable you think growth in all flash is going forward, especially as the compares get much more difficult from here?\nGeorge Kurian: Our all-flash array business was powered by two key things. The first is the strength of our technology, both the differentiation that we have with flash objects storage as an archival tier and hybrid cloud. And the second is the trust and confidence that the world\u2019s biggest companies are placing in NetApp. So we took several data center environments in large customers away from competitors like Hitachi and most importantly Dell. The power stored product that they have brought to market is not being well received by customers and we are displacing them in several accounts. All flash will continue to be a growing part of the total storage market. It has excellent economics and operational capabilities for customers that the amount of spending customers make on all flash in an absolute dollar sense will of course be a consideration of the macroeconomic environment and IT landscape. We will tell you more about our outlook for the storage market at Virtual Analyst Day. What I\u2019m confident about is that with the focus and operational execution that we now have in the field, we are going to be in a strong position to gain share in the all-flash array market.\nMatt Cabral: Got it. Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thank you, Matt. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ll stick to one as well and also congratulations on the results. Just kind of back on the all-flash business, I guess the one metric that stands out to me is I think you mentioned 25% of your installed base is now in all flash. If my memory is correct, I think last quarter it was 24% and I think even a year ago it was 22%. So it seems like \u2013 help me understand why that is inflecting higher, what\u2019s going to drive a broadening or an accelerated inflection in all flash in your opinion? Maybe also in that context, how much is your installed base growing?\nGeorge Kurian: Our installed base continues to grow and the fact that with strong growth rates in all-flash array, we move the penetration 1% at a time is just a dimension of the magnitude of our growing installed base. These are very, very big installed base numbers you\u2019re talking about. One flash array replaces a few disk-based systems, but I think that what we see as the face of adoption is really a representation of customer spend, right, their propensity to spend. Our view is that flash, as I just mentioned, will continue to be a priority for customers in terms of the wallet that they spend on storage. They will spend more in flash than on disk-based systems. There are more cost effective technologies that will continue to increase that percentage of the total market, but there will always be a place for disk-based hybrid flash systems as well. I think if you were to try to take an expectation, I would say that listen, over several quarters, we increased the percentage of our installed base 1% to 2% sequentially, right. And so we\u2019re focused on it. It\u2019s a large runway ahead and it\u2019s an asset that continues to provide us good opportunities to sell more value to customers.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Aaron. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nTim Long: Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the new split of product between hardware and software. Just a little more color if you could, kind of how do you demarcate that, how do you split that out? It doesn\u2019t look like the mix between the two has changed much, why is that? Is that ELA driven or something else? And what can we learn about margins between \u2013 within those two buckets within product, does that imply that given the software I\u2019m assuming is pretty high that the real hardware box type gross margins are much lower than what we\u2019re seeing for the whole group? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Hi, Tim. It\u2019s Mike. So great question. So a couple of things in there to jump into. One is and you\u2019ll see in the press release, we do include in the non-GAAP section some descriptions of how we come up with that revenue. It\u2019s basically the estimated fair value allocation of those transaction prices based on what we\u2019ve done with our customers similar to how we have to allocate revenue across the board. So there\u2019s a good explanation in there, but it\u2019s basically an estimated fair value of those components. The software and hardware components will move around a little bit. You mentioned ELA. That will certainly have an influence on what goes into each quarter. If you remember how those were accounted for back when we had a good number of those. From a margin perspective, I think you can assume that it\u2019s going to be typical software margins as it relates to our business as well. So it\u2019s going to be higher than the product margin average and the hardware will be lower. But I\u2019ll also caution that really depends by product. It\u2019s going to move around a little bit. So we want to break it out to your great question so that we can also start highlighting the growth of software maintenance because those will move together. And as we continue to sell more AFF, our expectations that we would expect the component of software and the resulting software maintenance would also increase as a percentage. So hopefully that helps. Thanks for that question.\nTim Long: Thank you and thanks for the disclosure.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Tim. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to ask just a couple of clarifying questions about your guidance commentary from earlier in the Q&A. First, Mike, on gross margins, I heard your comment that product margins would be flat sequentially. But if I apply the first quarter segment margins to the expected revenue mix in the second quarter, I get a total gross margin that\u2019s a little bit above 67%, so above your guidance. So is there a segment where you do see some sequential pressure on gross margin? And then the other point I guess, George, I\u2019ll ask you this on revenue. You said that we should look at the business on a sequential basis. If I adjust for the 40 million of extra revenue in the first quarter and then a bit of a currency tailwind in the second quarter, you\u2019re looking at normalized sequential growth of maybe low-single digits versus normal seasonality in an October quarter of plus 5% So just some high level comments from you George on what\u2019s driving the conservatism because that sequential is obviously off a July base that reflects the demand environment? Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in terms of order trends during the quarter that would get you to a little bit of below seasonal revenue outlook for October? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Okay. It\u2019s Mike. So I\u2019ll take the first one before George does the second one. So two things you hit on. One is it relates to the margin. When you back out the 40 million from the extra week, that lowers the percentage of gross margin dollars coming from services. So that will naturally bring down the total gross margin. The other thing is, it\u2019s not a huge mover but it\u2019s a little mover. As we do more cloud at this point, that has a small pull down impact on the services gross margin because those margins while increasing every quarter nicely are still a little below the services average. So those are the mechanics to think about when you look at Q2 total gross margin.\nKaty Huberty: Great. That\u2019s really helpful. And George?\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to the revenue picture, I think we\u2019re just communicating that we\u2019re taking it a quarter at a time. It\u2019s a volatile environment. We\u2019ve had a good start to the year. And we\u2019re not clear whether the traditional sequential seasonality patterns apply right now. So what I\u2019ll tell you is, we\u2019re not guiding a full year. We\u2019re giving you the best outlook we see and we\u2019re being cautious, right. That\u2019s really the summary.\nKaty Huberty: Okay, that\u2019s understandable. Thank you very much for that color.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Katy. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you, George, regarding the revenue guidance, I certainly appreciate that there\u2019s not a lot of visibility but could you drill down a little bit more on the current demand picture by region and customer type, enterprise, commercial, public sector, any areas of strength or weakness jump out? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I\u2019ll just give you a quick summary. From a segment perspective, clearly the larger enterprises where we have strong footprint was the sources of our growth. Small and medium customer is not a material part of our business. And you\u2019ve heard the commentary from several players in the IT industry, which is similar to what we see. They are challenged. We are picking up some of those small and medium customers through our cloud business where our offerings are more tailored to cash-constrained smaller companies. With regard to the geographies, essentially we had strong performance in the Americas market, driven by the strength in the largest enterprises in the Americas and our APAC region also performed well. I think the APAC region is reflective of some of those economies starting to recover from the really hard times of COVID, but we are being cautious and it\u2019s early. I think in terms of the types of transactions we saw, we did see growth in larger transactions. And what I said was, people are moving beyond business continuity to now transformational projects and investing in those. And so we benefitted from some of those.\nMatt Sheerin: Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is now open.\nSteven Fox: Thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to ask, maybe just push back a little bit on the decision still not to buy back stock. The company\u2019s \u2013 you look at last quarter and your guidance, you\u2019re doing basically an annualized $2.80 per share. You\u2019re doing more than that in EBITDA and obviously have proven ability to generate healthy cash flows during a down period. So what would trigger management\u2019s decision to maybe start buying back stock again? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Hi, Steve. It\u2019s Mike. So I will take that. So as we talked about on the last call when we decided to put the share buyback on hold, it was really we needed to be able to see a lot more firmly the economic recovery, the timeline as well as the depth. And while we\u2019re starting to feel better about the year, there\u2019s still a whole bunch of uncertainty. And as George talked about, there\u2019s still a lot of economic uncertainty. So for us, we need to be more comfortable about the recovery, the timeline of the recovery and then as well making sure that we are prudently managing our cash from a domestic and international perspective. All of that would weigh into it. This is the reason why we went out and did the opportunistic debt raise is to make sure that we had cash going forward. Also as we discussed in the last call, we also want to make sure that we are looking very hard at share buyback versus growing the business through again disciplined M&A and that will also play into it as well, Steven. And then I guess wanted to note very firmly we are very committed to the dividend and we want to make sure to maintain that, and that\u2019s another reason why we pulled back on the share buybacks.\nSteven Fox: Great. I appreciate that perspective. Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Steven. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nJeriel Ong: Thanks for letting me ask questions and congrats on the solid results. I want to focus in on the worldwide headcount reduction of 5% which you guys just verified. In the press report that came out yesterday kind of indicated that SolidFire and HCI might be a portion of those cuts, a little bit more I guess I would say exacerbated relative to the rest of your business. Could you clarify whether that is in fact true? Is that something that was focused on? And beyond that I guess as a percentage of focusing on those cuts in general or were there certain businesses or certain portions of the employee base that were impacted more? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: These headcount reductions are never easy to make and we take care and consideration when we decide to make those changes. Those changes were driven by the strategic alignment and focus that we have to prioritize our resources in the core storage systems and software business as well as accelerating our public cloud services business. We realigned about 5.5% of our workforce and those were in parts of the business \u2013 in all the functions of the business, but in those parts of the business that were not particularly aligned to our go-forward priorities. SolidFire, yes, I can confirm was part of the team impacted. We are narrowing our focus with the SolidFire and HCI portfolio to the high margin parts of the market as we have signaled on prior calls.\nJeriel Ong: Got it. I appreciate it. Thanks.\nKris Newton: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. I want to go back to cloud data services and look at this on an organic ARR basis. The quarter-on-quarter increase on that basis was $23 million sequentially annualized and in the prior quarter was $29 million. Given the fact that you\u2019ve got more GA status and it\u2019s more mature, why is that option rate not accelerating more to organic basis given the exposure to more cloud providers and maybe you can give us some sense of how the trajectory might change as we look forward here?\nGeorge Kurian: We made some cost improvement in our cloud services portfolio in the storage platform that allowed our customers to adopt cheaper and more cost effective tiers. This is similar to what hyperscalers do periodically. And so that did affect some of our customers on our existing cloud business choosing to deploy onto a lower cost tier. So it wasn\u2019t like we didn\u2019t add more customers and add more revenue. We did move some of our capacity within the quarter to a lower cost tier. That is pretty much the majority of the gap that you\u2019re seeing on a sequential basis.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. Circling back to Mike\u2019s comments on disciplined use of cash with M&A, George, can you maybe give us a sense of what areas from a technology roadmap you would look at from an M&A perspective?\nGeorge Kurian: I think that we are a disciplined acquirer both for strategic, cultural and economic fit. We\u2019ve been clear that we have a broad range of interest but software and cloud centric would be the two key filters that we would look at in terms of transactions. As we\u2019ve also said, we are skeptical about doing big large transactions. I think those are far and few between. And so the majority of our investigations are more smaller transactions that you would see.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, George. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa. Your line is now open.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay. Thank you. George, if you go back to one of your comments earlier is that small, medium business is not a material portion of your business, but looking at that you have some momentum and you\u2019re looking to gain share, you obviously must have recently done an evaluation as to why or why not to expand more aggressively into that sector which at times obviously has good rates. So can you give us an idea as you\u2019re thinking as to why that\u2019s not a good opportunity for you at all?\nGeorge Kurian: It\u2019s all a matter of prioritization. We run a disciplined P&L and within that P&L we have opportunities to deploy resources. We are covering the biggest enterprises through our direct portfolio and our direct sales reps. The small, medium business we see an opportunity to address through the cloud in a very differentiated and economically scalable manner. And so you\u2019ll see us continuing to focus there. So it\u2019s a matter of prioritization of where we spend our resources and being disciplined about it.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Lou. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. George, I\u2019m just curious. As you think about where NetApp is going to focus in both for the company as well as what you\u2019re seeing from your customers, what do you think is going to happen to offices going forward? What\u2019s your expectation for how many people go back? How do you sort of view how this new world we\u2019re going to live in post pandemic will be? I\u2019m just kind of curious as to what you\u2019re hearing, what you\u2019re thinking? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you for your question. We meet customers across the board. As I said, the number of executive briefings and senior executive interactions that I\u2019ve had over the last six months have been higher than at any time before because I can be on \u2013 in a single day in multiple time zones across the globe. What we see predominately is that the world at large is operating in a subdued mostly working from home model, especially in the IT buyers and the knowledge workers in our customer base. We think that that will continue. In fact, NetApp has already signaled to our employees a few weeks ago that we are going to be working from home till July of next calendar year. And so we do see this idea of our customers digitizing their businesses for both internal collaboration as well as customer interaction becoming a priority, we see the deployment of cloud together with on-premises as a needed catalogue of IT services and we have been saying that that would happen for a long period of time, and we\u2019re going to take advantage of it.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Shannon. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nJim Suva: Thank you. And I don\u2019t know if this one question, the single question I have is best for Mike or George, but I heard earlier on the Q&A commentary of encouraging us to look at EPS on a quarter-over-quarter basis instead of year-over-year basis, and I\u2019m just kind of trying to figure out why? Is that all due to COVID? Or you\u2019re getting close to year-over-year revenues being flat or positive excluding this quarter with extra week, but on the outlook, but yet the year-over-year EPS next quarter is down pretty sizably. Maybe that\u2019s NAND pricing, maybe that\u2019s cost structure integration. Can you just kind of walk us through the logic about why you want us to focus on quarter-over-quarter instead of year-over-year for profitability?\nMike Berry: Sure. Jim, thanks for the question. It\u2019s Mike. A couple of pieces there. In the prepared remarks, we wanted to make sure that when you compared the Q1 EPS number with the Q2 guide that you took into account the impact of the additional OpEx from the acquisitions as well as the 14th week, there was just a good number of moving parts there. So that\u2019s why we did focus on that in the commentary. And then yes, certainly from a year-over-year perspective as it relates to OpEx has obviously a lot to do with the revenue guide and where we are as well as us wanting to make sure that we continue to invest in the growth areas. So I didn\u2019t want to be confusing on that. Just wanted to make sure as you looked at Q1 to Q2 that you also took into account some of those large muscle movers.\nGeorge Kurian: One of the other items that we had in the EPS for Q2 on a year-on-year basis was the interest expense related to the debt rate. So Mike and I are giving you sort of the big moving parts. I think as we said, that\u2019s a way for you to understand the compare between Q1 and Q2 EPS.\nJim Suva: Thank you. That\u2019s greatly appreciated, gentlemen.\nKris Newton: All right. Thank you, Jim. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.\nAnanda Baruah: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a solid quarter and good execution. Just real quickly George and Mike, I\u2019d love to just get any context around sort of the activities coming together of the cloud data services sales team, what they\u2019re focused on and how long you think it will be until those guys get productive? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: The cloud data services sales team is a group of experts that we\u2019ve hired with cloud backgrounds. They are focused on working closely with the hyperscalers, meaning Microsoft, Amazon and Google and selling us alongside their team as well as working with the NetApp sales team to get our installed base of customers who adopt our cloud portfolio. We\u2019re pleased. We\u2019re one quarter into the organization, but they\u2019ve clearly had an impact and we\u2019re looking forward to continuous success from them.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Ananda. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nVictor Chiu: Hi. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. Could you provide us with an update around your Keystone as a service offering and the progress you\u2019re seeing there, and maybe help us understand if there\u2019s a relationship between public cloud services demand and the potential impact there on consumption-based subscription services, whether there\u2019s a complementary relationship there or if that one impacts the other in a particular way?\nGeorge Kurian: We\u2019ve had a good start to Keystone. Keystone is selectively available to customers in some of our geographies. We will be making it more broadly available this coming quarter. And so we\u2019ll invite you to come to our INSIGHT User Conference to hear more. We\u2019ve had several comparative wins this quarter with Keystone and Keystone as you said correctly is a good complement to our public cloud services. So a customer that has a temporary workload or wants to move an entire business process to the public cloud can choose the public cloud. And if there\u2019s a portion of that business process or there\u2019s a complementary infrastructure that they want to have deployed and run within their data center for compliance reasons or for integration to other applications, they can use Keystone and get a single experience from their data center to the public cloud. So we\u2019re pleased with the progress. You\u2019ll hear more about Keystone from us at our User Conference.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Victor. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes. I wanted to go a layer deeper on the COVID-related pricing trends and how they\u2019re manifesting themselves. Is it about competitive displacements? Is it about defending the installed base? Is there a particular vertical? Just some help there please.\nGeorge Kurian: Typically what happens when commodity prices go up is that we and others in the industry pass them along to customers because we typically do not hedge the commodity. We pass along the cost of SSDs through to customers when they go up or when they go down. Clearly in the COVID time that is not something we want to do. Our customers need us to be good partners and so we\u2019ve been careful about having them bear the brunt of the price increases. With regard to competitive take up and displacements, they are always a portion of our go-to-market model and we have the capabilities within our gross margin model to be aggressive in certain cases and not as aggressive in others, and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on maintaining discipline there.\nEric Martinuzzi: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Eric. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Congrats on some exceptionally strong results, quite amazing. A technical question from me. So Spot provides compute management in the cloud. Is this leveraging Kubernetes or is that by adding in additional software that Spot has layered on top of Kubernetes and does this effectively make it a competitor to say VMware\u2019s vRealize and their bevy of cloud relationships?\nGeorge Kurian: What Spot does is both for traditional applications as well as for cloud-native applications, it identifies the pattern of behavior of that application and finds the optimized compute environment to run that application most cost effectively. So it is entirely complementary and we are very good partners, for example, with Amazon where we tell customers use the right compute tier in Amazon so that they can run more compute for the same money on the Amazon tier. We see Spot as complementary to all of our cloud providers and frankly cloud complementary to VMware. It is optimizing the run time environment for customers regardless of what version of Kubernetes they use, which class provider they run on and whether they\u2019re using a traditional application or a cloud-native application. What is also allows us to do is now because we can optimize compute and storage, we are able to address 70% of a typical customer\u2019s cloud bill and optimize a substantial amount of that cloud bill. So now we are much more strategically relevant to customers as a result of us having Spot in our portfolio.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Nehal. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.\nNikolay Todorov: Yes. Thanks. I want to go back to the comments around strength in large enterprise and large deals. I think that has been consistent across the peers in the industry, but I just want to get your take on \u2013 you talked about the digital transformation. So are we assuming that those spending is going towards new workloads? And how sustainable do you think is that strength in large enterprise deals? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think we see larger enterprises increasingly doing two things. One is exploiting data to understand and serve their customers better. That\u2019s an enduring generational trend. We also see them deploying hybrid cloud landscape so that they can serve their own employees who are working from home or extend the reach of their businesses to consumers who no longer can come into their offices. And we are extremely well positioned for both those trends. I think what we see in the large enterprise is they have the financial resources and the strategic runway to make those decisions and in fact now rather than have to necessarily wait for COVID, and that\u2019s where we saw the segment-related pattern of our business morph a little bit.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Nik. I\u2019ll pass it over to George for some final comments.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you for being with us this afternoon. In the face of the current macro uncertainty, we continue to make strategic moves that position us well for the long term while maintaining operational discipline. Our rich data-centric software innovation is the foundation from which we have customers thrive in a hybrid cloud world. We bring enterprise-grade data services to the cloud and the simplicity and flexibility at the cloud to the enterprise data center. No matter where a customer is on their hybrid cloud journey, NetApp can help them achieve their goals. I hope you will join us at our Virtual Analyst Day where we\u2019ll talk more about how we help customers unlock the best of cloud for their digital transformation. Stay safe and be well. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George noted, despite the continued macro uncertainty in Q1 as a result of COVID-19, we delivered revenue, operating margin and EPS above the high-end of guidance. Importantly, solid execution by the sales team, in a very difficult environment, yielded Q1 billings of $1.15 billion, up 6% year-over-year. In Q1, net revenue of $1.3 billion increased 5% year-over-year, including a point of currency headwind. Our two key strategic focus areas; our storage business, powered by our industry-leading file, block and object software, and Public Cloud Services, both outperformed the market in the quarter. Our all-flash revenue of $567 million was up 34% year-over-year, nicely positioning us for share gains in the quarter. We remain confident in the growth opportunity for all-flash adoption. At the end of Q1, 25% of our installed systems were all-flash, providing a healthy runway as customers continue to embrace the cloud-connectivity and investment protection offered by our flash solutions. Public Cloud Services delivered an impressive $178 million in ARR, growing 192% year-over-year and 60% sequentially. Our recent acquisitions of Spot, CloudJumper and Talon contributed a total of $44 million of ARR as of the end of the quarter. Even excluding these acquisitions, the growth of our Public Cloud Services business accelerated to 120% year-over-year. We plan to provide an updated framework for our Public Cloud Services opportunity at our upcoming virtual Analyst Day. Total product revenue of $627 million decreased approximately 3% year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw growth in our largest global enterprise accounts as customers initiated digital transformation and hybrid cloud projects. To provide improved visibility into the value created by our high-margin software franchise, we are now breaking out product revenues between software and hardware. Software product revenue of $311 million increased 2% year-over-year, driven by an increase in our software-rich all-flash FAS. Hardware product revenue of $316 million decreased 7% year-over-year, as spinning disk solutions continued to decline. The engineering DNA of NetApp and the value we provide to customers and shareholders is grounded in software. We will continue to highlight and invest in this innovation engine. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $608 million was up 14% year-over-year and up 6% year-over-year when adjusted for the approximately $40 million related to the extra week in the quarter. These two recurring revenue lines comprised roughly 47% of total net revenue. When combined, software revenue and recurring maintenance revenue totaled $919 million in Q1, representing 71% of total revenue. We ended Q1 with $3.6 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 3% year-over-year as we continued to grow our installed base. Gross margin of 68% was up nearly 1 point year-over-year. Product gross margin was 51.4%, a decrease of 2 points year-over-year and in-line with our expectations. The year-over-year decline was driven by materially higher NAND costs and COVID-related pricing trends. We believe both of these headwinds are transitory in nature. However, given the uncertainty in the macro environment, we are cautiously assuming that a combination of these factors will persist throughout the remainder of fiscal '21. In the interim, we will continue to focus on reinforcing our strategy of selling on the value of our solutions. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us, with gross margin of 83.4%, up 1 point year-over-year. The margin expansion was driven by continued leverage in our support model and exhibits the strong margin profile of a business with a software and recurring revenue model. Q1 operating expenses of $673 million increased approximately 3% year-over-year, driven by the incremental $30 million associated with the extra week in Q1 and higher variable compensation resulting from the better than expected revenue and profitability. Operating margin was 16.3%, up 2 points from Q1 of last year. EPS of $0.73 was up 12% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $240 million and free cash flow was $188 million, representing 14% of revenue. Cash flow from operations included a one-time tax payment of $57 million related to acquisitions. Excluding this item, operating cash flow would have been $297 million and free cash flow would have been $245 million, or 19% of revenue. During the quarter we paid out $107 million in cash dividends, representing 57% of free cash flow. As we noted on the Q4 call, we believe it is prudent to pause our share repurchase program until we have a better sense for the timing and magnitude of the broader economic recovery. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 222 million, down 21 million shares year-over-year, representing a 9% decrease. We will maintain our cash dividend of $0.48 per share in Q2. We ended Q1 with $3.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. As you know, during the quarter we raised $2 billion in long-term debt. As of the end of the quarter, we used approximately $900 million of our debt raise to reduce our commercial paper balance and pay down 2021 senior debt maturities. The debt raise further enhances our already strong liquidity position, while also providing financial flexibility from additional domestic cash balances during the current economic environment. To be clear, even with this added liquidity, we will maintain our long history of disciplined M&A. Now to guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.225 billion and $1.375 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 5% decline in revenues year-over-year and includes 1 point of currency tailwind. As a reminder, the maintenance revenue benefit in Q1 from the extra week will not repeat in Q2. As a result, we expect our total maintenance revenue in Q2 to grow year-over-year while being down approximately $30 million sequentially from Q1. As a result of this sequential mix shift between product and maintenance revenues, we expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67%. We expect operating margin to be approximately 16% in Q2. Assumed in this guidance are operating expenses of $655 million to $665 million including $20 million related to our recent acquisitions. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. And we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $0.66 and $0.74 per share. Assumed in this guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million, driven by increased interest expense from our recent debt offering. As a reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow. This is further compounded by our annual cash tax payments associated with repatriation tax reform. Q1 earnings clearly came in better than expected. When comparing our Q2 EPS guide relative to the Q1 print, please remember the items I walked through earlier as they materially impact the normal sequential compares. As promised, we will be very disciplined around our cost structure. As outlined in our 8-K filing today, we are realigning resources and investments to continue to optimize our business to fund our biggest strategic priorities; returning to growth in our storage software and systems business, while scaling Public Cloud Services. Going forward, we will remain disciplined around our OpEx envelope as we look for reinvestment opportunities that allow us to position the company for long-term success. Also noted in today's 8-K filing is the departure of Scott Allen, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. I want to personally thank Scott for all of his contributions to NetApp over the past four years. He will definitely be missed. We wish Scott the best in the next chapter of his career. In closing, I want to reiterate our confidence in our strategic roadmap and our commitment to continue to evolve NetApp into a cloud-led company, building on our rich data-centric software heritage. We believe this transition, coupled with solid execution, will drive significant long-term value for our shareholders. We hope all of you can join us at our upcoming Virtual Analyst Day on September 16. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Sure, Rod. So on the first one on ELA \u2013 so it lasted until the second question, so that's good. What I would say is we told you last quarter that we are not going to discuss ELAs. My comment there would be if we do anything of significance size, you absolutely will see it in the financial statements, you'll see it in margin and also now with us breaking out software revenue as a part of product revenue, you'll also see it there. So you'll be able to track that for any significant ELAs going forward. On core product, so we've guided to a pretty consistent core product margin as it relates to the areas that we discussed, NAND pricing as well as COVID pricing. Given the uncertainty in the economy, we are conservatively assuming something relatively similar going forward. We do expect there to be a little bit of help on NAND pricing as we go through the rest of the year, but that's a little out of our control, Rod. It's really based on industry supply and demand. Okay. Hi, Sam. It's Mike. I'll take the first one. So when you look at the guide for OpEx, the midpoint of the guide about 660, last year we did about 631, so I'll do a year-over-year for you is that the acquisitions will add about 20 million of expenses year-over-year. So that is something obviously new year-over-year and that's all three of them together. We will have higher variable pay. Last year from a bonus and a commission perspective, the accruals were quite low given the performance. And then that will be offset by about 15 million of savings from the restructuring. Keep in mind that that's only two of three months that we'll get the credit for. So that's your year-over-year walk on OpEx. Hi, Tim. It's Mike. So great question. So a couple of things in there to jump into. One is and you'll see in the press release, we do include in the non-GAAP section some descriptions of how we come up with that revenue. It's basically the estimated fair value allocation of those transaction prices based on what we've done with our customers similar to how we have to allocate revenue across the board. So there's a good explanation in there, but it's basically an estimated fair value of those components. The software and hardware components will move around a little bit. You mentioned ELA. That will certainly have an influence on what goes into each quarter. If you remember how those were accounted for back when we had a good number of those. From a margin perspective, I think you can assume that it's going to be typical software margins as it relates to our business as well. So it's going to be higher than the product margin average and the hardware will be lower. But I'll also caution that really depends by product. It's going to move around a little bit. So we want to break it out to your great question so that we can also start highlighting the growth of software maintenance because those will move together. And as we continue to sell more AFF, our expectations that we would expect the component of software and the resulting software maintenance would also increase as a percentage. So hopefully that helps. Thanks for that question. Okay. It's Mike. So I'll take the first one before George does the second one. So two things you hit on. One is it relates to the margin. When you back out the 40 million from the extra week, that lowers the percentage of gross margin dollars coming from services. So that will naturally bring down the total gross margin. The other thing is, it's not a huge mover but it's a little mover. As we do more cloud at this point, that has a small pull down impact on the services gross margin because those margins while increasing every quarter nicely are still a little below the services average. So those are the mechanics to think about when you look at Q2 total gross margin. Hi, Steve. It's Mike. So I will take that. So as we talked about on the last call when we decided to put the share buyback on hold, it was really we needed to be able to see a lot more firmly the economic recovery, the timeline as well as the depth. And while we're starting to feel better about the year, there's still a whole bunch of uncertainty. And as George talked about, there's still a lot of economic uncertainty. So for us, we need to be more comfortable about the recovery, the timeline of the recovery and then as well making sure that we are prudently managing our cash from a domestic and international perspective. All of that would weigh into it. This is the reason why we went out and did the opportunistic debt raise is to make sure that we had cash going forward. Also as we discussed in the last call, we also want to make sure that we are looking very hard at share buyback versus growing the business through again disciplined M&A and that will also play into it as well, Steven. And then I guess wanted to note very firmly we are very committed to the dividend and we want to make sure to maintain that, and that's another reason why we pulled back on the share buybacks. Sure. Jim, thanks for the question. It's Mike. A couple of pieces there. In the prepared remarks, we wanted to make sure that when you compared the Q1 EPS number with the Q2 guide that you took into account the impact of the additional OpEx from the acquisitions as well as the 14th week, there was just a good number of moving parts there. So that's why we did focus on that in the commentary. And then yes, certainly from a year-over-year perspective as it relates to OpEx has obviously a lot to do with the revenue guide and where we are as well as us wanting to make sure that we continue to invest in the growth areas. So I didn't want to be confusing on that. Just wanted to make sure as you looked at Q1 to Q2 that you also took into account some of those large muscle movers."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks, Kris, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We hope that you all are staying safe and healthy. As we navigate the health, economic and social changes impacting all of us, we continue to focus on what we can control and improve our operational execution. In the face of an uncertain environment, NetApp performed well in the quarter, with revenue, operating margin and EPS all exceeding our guidance. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work in the midst of this pandemic. Due to the global pandemic, the macroeconomic and IT spending environments remain challenging, consistent with what we saw exiting Q4. Despite these pressures, enterprises are prioritizing transformational and hybrid cloud projects, which drove our momentum as customers turn to NetApp to help them accelerate these plans. At NetApp, we work hard to be the best partner to our customers, a value that is even more important during these particularly challenging times. We continue to deliver heightened support for customers delivering vital public health and safety services, first responders and public sector institutions. For IT teams affected by the pandemic, we are offering 25 terabytes of NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud free of charge. We also extended our partner financing program to assist partners and customers in managing their cash flow. Uncertainty remains high, but we are moving into a new normal and adjusting to operate in a virtual environment. The majority of NetApp employees are working from home and have quickly built the muscle of interacting with each other, our customers and our partners remotely. Our sales teams are getting in front of buyers to meet and build demand. The number of Executive Briefing Center visits, now held virtually, increased by more than 50% over briefings held in Q1 a year ago. We also saw a doubling in the number of prospects in our virtual Executive Briefing Centers compared to in-person meetings last year. And our reinvigorated Run to NetApp competitive takeout program delivered strong Q1 results with good growth in future opportunities. The improvements we made to sales coverage in FY20 and the tighter focus on execution are starting to pay off. Our customers are also adapting to the new normal. Companies are moving beyond the initial response to the pandemic of operationalizing work from home. They are now looking to accelerate digital transformations to drive competitive advantage by delivering services and products remotely, reaching customers through digital means and optimizing remote operations and collaboration. The acceleration of digital transformations means more enterprises are managing IT environments both on-premises and in the cloud. NetApp leverages our rich data-centric software innovation to help customers thrive in this hybrid cloud world. We help them move applications to the cloud significantly faster than any other vendor, rapidly deploy business continuity solutions, enable remote workforces to collaborate and accelerate application software development. We bring enterprise-grade data services to the cloud and the simplicity and the flexibility of the cloud to the enterprise data center. With our data fabric strategy, we help customers tackle the challenges of hybrid cloud. No matter where a customer is on their hybrid cloud journey, NetApp can help them achieve their goals. As I stated on the Q4 call, we have two clear priorities in fiscal year '21; returning to growth in our storage business powered by share gains from our industry-leading file, block and object software and scaling our highly differentiated cloud services business. We will exploit competitive transitions, the continued growth of the all-flash array market, and the accelerated shift to cloud to expand the use of our products and services. We continue to make great progress in our cloud business. Customers are now beginning to deploy critical workloads in the cloud, which drives requirements for enterprise-grade capabilities. We bring nearly three decades of enterprise tested, data-centric software innovation to the cloud. Cloud providers recognize this and this is why they are choosing to partner with us. Customers also recognize this and this is why they are choosing NetApp to help them accelerate their digital transformation and cloud roadmaps. Leading with cloud in the marketplace, enables us to reach both installed base customers and new-to-NetApp customers. In Q1, roughly half of the new-to-NetApp customers came in through our cloud business. New customers, growth at existing customers, and an expanded portfolio drove an acceleration of our cloud ARR to $178 million, an increase of 192% year-over-year. In Q1, we acquired CloudJumper, a provider of cloud-based virtual desktop services; and Spot, a leader in compute management and cost optimization on the public clouds. In addition to extending our value proposition to cover more of customers' cloud spend, these acquisitions bring strong talent with cloud DNA to our marketing, sales and engineering teams, and they are driving increased interest in NetApp. More customers are coming to us because they are excited by our cloud strategy and ability to help them deploy applications and optimize compute and storage in the cloud. As I've said many times, our cloud services make us a more attractive strategic partner to customers and help us gain share in the enterprise data center. Our industry-leading storage operating system software, ONTAP, is key to our success in the cloud and on-premises. ONTAP is the most powerful, most cloud-connected, and most efficient storage operating system on the market. Not only do we provide customers with a consistent operating system across data center and cloud to unify their hybrid cloud, we provide them with the flexibility of a cloud-like purchasing experience through our Keystone service. One of the key features of ONTAP is FabricPool, which allows customers to create policies for the automatic tiering of infrequently accessed data to a more cost-effective tier such as Azure, AWS, Google, or any S3 target, including our object storage solution, StorageGRID. During these uncertain economic times, customers are finding even greater value in our ability to help them take advantage of high-performance all-flash arrays while reducing total cost of ownership through automated tiering to a lower cost cloud or object tier. This and other industry-leading capabilities helped drive strong growth for both StorageGRID and the A-series all-flash FAS array. Based on the strong 34% year-over-year growth in our all-flash business, we expect we have gained share in this important market. NetApp is uniquely positioned to help customers unlock the best of cloud for their digital transformation. We are building on a strong foundation of industry-leading data-centric software innovation, trusted customer relationships and an open-ecosystem approach that is strengthened by partnerships with the leading public cloud companies who endorse our Data Fabric Strategy. With the ongoing pandemic, the near future remains uncertain for many companies, and no one knows when we will return to a more normal and predictable environment. Despite the uncertainties, one thing is clear. Data is growing in scale and importance. We help the world's leading organizations solve the challenge of managing their most critical data. In closing, I want to reiterate my confidence for NetApp's future. We have strengthened our leadership team, broadened our portfolio, and enhanced our partnerships. We are listening to the market and customers and will continue to respond to their requirements with speed and agility. We will continue to be agile in our response to the market conditions created by the pandemic while positioning NetApp to address the long-term opportunity. Our strong business model and disciplined management supports our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. We are tightly aligned to our customers' priorities and deeply committed to creating value for our customers and shareholders alike. Finally, I want to call out a couple of key events happening this quarter. I hope that you will all be able to join our Virtual Analyst Day on September 16. You can register from our Investor Relations Web site. Our flagship user conference, INSIGHT, will be fully virtual October 26 to 29. We hope you can tune in to hear more about how NetApp helps customers unlock the best of cloud. I'll now turn it over to Mike to walk you through the results of the quarter. We saw growth in the cloud business from a lot of new customers new to NetApp where about half of our new to NetApp customers for the quarter came through our cloud business and a good chunk of the cloud customers were new workloads, meaning new wallet in accounts where we have presence. So the substitution of on-prem workloads to the public cloud was the smallest part of the growth of our overall cloud business. We are seeing the use of cloud increasingly for disaster protection and business continuum purposes. We've had several wins during the quarter where customers combine our on-premise all-flash array business with a flexible disaster protection copy in the cloud. So we're very, very pleased with the progress in our cloud business. Our hyperscalers are helping us scale. We're getting new logos, new wallets in existing customers and building new architectures for customers as well. We've always said that we are moving customers' most important workloads to the cloud. So these workloads are incredibly sticky once they're deployed in the cloud, but they require planning and deliberations before you do that. What we saw through the course of the quarter again was sequential acceleration of our cloud storage business where not only did our business with Microsoft grow, but our business with the other hyperscalers were also up to really good starts. We are seeing the software-based solutions which complement the high-performance Azure NetApp Files use cases growing nicely and our acquisitions are allowing us access to net new customers and new wallets, the compute wallet [indiscernible] desktop as a service wallet in customer. So I couldn't be more pleased about the progress. We will tell you more about the long-term expectations of our cloud business at our Virtual Analyst Day. The second question that you had asked was about the productivity of the team that we hired. They are deployed and they are contributing well to our business. You see that strength in both for the enterprise storage systems in software business as well as the growing contribution of our cloud business. So we're pleased we're off to a good start and we're excited that the momentum that those heads add to our business. The July quarter did not include any transactional revenue from the extra week. We had about 40 million as we explained in our prepared remarks from the services revenue in the July quarter due to the extra week. With regard to the October quarter, I'll just say at a high level we see the October quarter relatively the same from a macro perspective and a demand perspective that we see in the current quarter. So I would say that you're looking at the business more on a sequential basis rather than a year-on-year basis. We have continued to monitor the market. I would tell you that it's hard for me to predict the seasonality of our business. And so we're giving you an outlook on a quarterly basis. And so far what we see in the October quarter is somewhat similar to what we see in the July quarter. Kubernetes is a technology that grows very quickly as the new way to deploy applications and manage infrastructure. NetApp has excellent solutions for customers who are building applications using containers and Kubernetes. We have two of those solutions that work in concert; the persistent storage solution both using our Trident software and Project Astra provide customers really capable application data management capabilities, and the technology that we acquired with Spot allows customers to really optimize the cost and the effectiveness of their Kubernetes application environment. So we're really excited. We have some state-of-the-art solutions that customers are adopting and we'll tell you more about it on our Virtual Analyst Day. And the compute optimization that we acquired with Spot that is particularly helpful in Kubernetes environment. Our all-flash array business was powered by two key things. The first is the strength of our technology, both the differentiation that we have with flash objects storage as an archival tier and hybrid cloud. And the second is the trust and confidence that the world's biggest companies are placing in NetApp. So we took several data center environments in large customers away from competitors like Hitachi and most importantly Dell. The power stored product that they have brought to market is not being well received by customers and we are displacing them in several accounts. All flash will continue to be a growing part of the total storage market. It has excellent economics and operational capabilities for customers that the amount of spending customers make on all flash in an absolute dollar sense will of course be a consideration of the macroeconomic environment and IT landscape. We will tell you more about our outlook for the storage market at Virtual Analyst Day. What I'm confident about is that with the focus and operational execution that we now have in the field, we are going to be in a strong position to gain share in the all-flash array market. Our installed base continues to grow and the fact that with strong growth rates in all-flash array, we move the penetration 1% at a time is just a dimension of the magnitude of our growing installed base. These are very, very big installed base numbers you're talking about. One flash array replaces a few disk-based systems, but I think that what we see as the face of adoption is really a representation of customer spend, right, their propensity to spend. Our view is that flash, as I just mentioned, will continue to be a priority for customers in terms of the wallet that they spend on storage. They will spend more in flash than on disk-based systems. There are more cost effective technologies that will continue to increase that percentage of the total market, but there will always be a place for disk-based hybrid flash systems as well. I think if you were to try to take an expectation, I would say that listen, over several quarters, we increased the percentage of our installed base 1% to 2% sequentially, right. And so we're focused on it. It's a large runway ahead and it's an asset that continues to provide us good opportunities to sell more value to customers. With regard to the revenue picture, I think we're just communicating that we're taking it a quarter at a time. It's a volatile environment. We've had a good start to the year. And we're not clear whether the traditional sequential seasonality patterns apply right now. So what I'll tell you is, we're not guiding a full year. We're giving you the best outlook we see and we're being cautious, right. That's really the summary. I'll just give you a quick summary. From a segment perspective, clearly the larger enterprises where we have strong footprint was the sources of our growth. Small and medium customer is not a material part of our business. And you've heard the commentary from several players in the IT industry, which is similar to what we see. They are challenged. We are picking up some of those small and medium customers through our cloud business where our offerings are more tailored to cash-constrained smaller companies. With regard to the geographies, essentially we had strong performance in the Americas market, driven by the strength in the largest enterprises in the Americas and our APAC region also performed well. I think the APAC region is reflective of some of those economies starting to recover from the really hard times of COVID, but we are being cautious and it's early. I think in terms of the types of transactions we saw, we did see growth in larger transactions. And what I said was, people are moving beyond business continuity to now transformational projects and investing in those. And so we benefitted from some of those. These headcount reductions are never easy to make and we take care and consideration when we decide to make those changes. Those changes were driven by the strategic alignment and focus that we have to prioritize our resources in the core storage systems and software business as well as accelerating our public cloud services business. We realigned about 5.5% of our workforce and those were in parts of the business \u2013 in all the functions of the business, but in those parts of the business that were not particularly aligned to our go-forward priorities. SolidFire, yes, I can confirm was part of the team impacted. We are narrowing our focus with the SolidFire and HCI portfolio to the high margin parts of the market as we have signaled on prior calls. We made some cost improvement in our cloud services portfolio in the storage platform that allowed our customers to adopt cheaper and more cost effective tiers. This is similar to what hyperscalers do periodically. And so that did affect some of our customers on our existing cloud business choosing to deploy onto a lower cost tier. So it wasn't like we didn't add more customers and add more revenue. We did move some of our capacity within the quarter to a lower cost tier. That is pretty much the majority of the gap that you're seeing on a sequential basis. I think that we are a disciplined acquirer both for strategic, cultural and economic fit. We've been clear that we have a broad range of interest but software and cloud centric would be the two key filters that we would look at in terms of transactions. As we've also said, we are skeptical about doing big large transactions. I think those are far and few between. And so the majority of our investigations are more smaller transactions that you would see. It's all a matter of prioritization. We run a disciplined P&L and within that P&L we have opportunities to deploy resources. We are covering the biggest enterprises through our direct portfolio and our direct sales reps. The small, medium business we see an opportunity to address through the cloud in a very differentiated and economically scalable manner. And so you'll see us continuing to focus there. So it's a matter of prioritization of where we spend our resources and being disciplined about it. Thank you for your question. We meet customers across the board. As I said, the number of executive briefings and senior executive interactions that I've had over the last six months have been higher than at any time before because I can be on \u2013 in a single day in multiple time zones across the globe. What we see predominately is that the world at large is operating in a subdued mostly working from home model, especially in the IT buyers and the knowledge workers in our customer base. We think that that will continue. In fact, NetApp has already signaled to our employees a few weeks ago that we are going to be working from home till July of next calendar year. And so we do see this idea of our customers digitizing their businesses for both internal collaboration as well as customer interaction becoming a priority, we see the deployment of cloud together with on-premises as a needed catalogue of IT services and we have been saying that that would happen for a long period of time, and we're going to take advantage of it. One of the other items that we had in the EPS for Q2 on a year-on-year basis was the interest expense related to the debt rate. So Mike and I are giving you sort of the big moving parts. I think as we said, that's a way for you to understand the compare between Q1 and Q2 EPS. The cloud data services sales team is a group of experts that we've hired with cloud backgrounds. They are focused on working closely with the hyperscalers, meaning Microsoft, Amazon and Google and selling us alongside their team as well as working with the NetApp sales team to get our installed base of customers who adopt our cloud portfolio. We're pleased. We're one quarter into the organization, but they've clearly had an impact and we're looking forward to continuous success from them. We've had a good start to Keystone. Keystone is selectively available to customers in some of our geographies. We will be making it more broadly available this coming quarter. And so we'll invite you to come to our INSIGHT User Conference to hear more. We've had several comparative wins this quarter with Keystone and Keystone as you said correctly is a good complement to our public cloud services. So a customer that has a temporary workload or wants to move an entire business process to the public cloud can choose the public cloud. And if there's a portion of that business process or there's a complementary infrastructure that they want to have deployed and run within their data center for compliance reasons or for integration to other applications, they can use Keystone and get a single experience from their data center to the public cloud. So we're pleased with the progress. You'll hear more about Keystone from us at our User Conference. Typically what happens when commodity prices go up is that we and others in the industry pass them along to customers because we typically do not hedge the commodity. We pass along the cost of SSDs through to customers when they go up or when they go down. Clearly in the COVID time that is not something we want to do. Our customers need us to be good partners and so we've been careful about having them bear the brunt of the price increases. With regard to competitive take up and displacements, they are always a portion of our go-to-market model and we have the capabilities within our gross margin model to be aggressive in certain cases and not as aggressive in others, and we're going to continue to focus on maintaining discipline there. What Spot does is both for traditional applications as well as for cloud-native applications, it identifies the pattern of behavior of that application and finds the optimized compute environment to run that application most cost effectively. So it is entirely complementary and we are very good partners, for example, with Amazon where we tell customers use the right compute tier in Amazon so that they can run more compute for the same money on the Amazon tier. We see Spot as complementary to all of our cloud providers and frankly cloud complementary to VMware. It is optimizing the run time environment for customers regardless of what version of Kubernetes they use, which class provider they run on and whether they're using a traditional application or a cloud-native application. What is also allows us to do is now because we can optimize compute and storage, we are able to address 70% of a typical customer's cloud bill and optimize a substantial amount of that cloud bill. So now we are much more strategically relevant to customers as a result of us having Spot in our portfolio. I think we see larger enterprises increasingly doing two things. One is exploiting data to understand and serve their customers better. That's an enduring generational trend. We also see them deploying hybrid cloud landscape so that they can serve their own employees who are working from home or extend the reach of their businesses to consumers who no longer can come into their offices. And we are extremely well positioned for both those trends. I think what we see in the large enterprise is they have the financial resources and the strategic runway to make those decisions and in fact now rather than have to necessarily wait for COVID, and that's where we saw the segment-related pattern of our business morph a little bit. Thank you for being with us this afternoon. In the face of the current macro uncertainty, we continue to make strategic moves that position us well for the long term while maintaining operational discipline. Our rich data-centric software innovation is the foundation from which we have customers thrive in a hybrid cloud world. We bring enterprise-grade data services to the cloud and the simplicity and flexibility at the cloud to the enterprise data center. No matter where a customer is on their hybrid cloud journey, NetApp can help them achieve their goals. I hope you will join us at our Virtual Analyst Day where we'll talk more about how we help customers unlock the best of cloud for their digital transformation. Stay safe and be well. Thank you."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nKris Newton: Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for first quarter and fiscal year 2023, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns, the value we bring to customers, our ability to drive continued growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments and our ability to manage through the current supply chain environment, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions and the IT capital spending environment as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, grow our Cloud business and generate greater cash flow. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K including in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you, Kris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. Our solid fourth quarter results cap off a strong year. We made sustained progress against our strategic goals, successfully achieving our commitment to grow the business while delivering operating leverage in fiscal 2022. We gained share in enterprise storage with strong growth in all-flash array and object storage products. We expanded our public cloud business with robust expansion of customers, ARR, innovation, and routes to market. And, most notably, we delivered record levels of gross margin dollars, operating income, and earnings per share. While the demand environment remains strong, macroeconomic uncertainty, including supply constraints, rising interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical conflict, has increased since we last spoke with you at our Investor Day in March. Navigating this complex and dynamic environment is testing our teams, and we are sharply focused on managing what is in our control. Backlog is elevated due to supply constraints, despite our excellent supply chain management helping us meet as much of the demand as possible. I want to thank our global team for their disciplined execution and agile response to changing conditions. That we achieved all-time highs for gross margin dollars, operating income, and earnings per share in the face of these headwinds demonstrates our disciplined operating management. The turbulent environment also creates challenges for our customers, raising the urgency for data driven digital and cloud transformations. We sit at the intersection of these megatrends, as the complexities created by rapid data growth, multi-cloud management, and the adoption of next-gen technologies such as AI, cloud native, and modern application and data infrastructures create a sizeable opportunity for us. At our Investor Day, we outlined our objective to deliver long-term value through sustained growth and that thesis remains unchanged. Our critical role in helping customers achieve their transformation goals underpins our strategy and drives confidence for future growth. Public Cloud ARR of $505 million grew 68% year-over-year and the Q4 dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains strong at 159%. Before I get to the many highlights of the quarter, I want to address the fact that our Public Cloud ARR came short of our expectations. Demand for our cloud storage solutions was strong in Q4. We also saw a healthy number of new customer additions across both cloud storage and cloud operations services in the quarter. Unfortunately, these tailwinds were not enough to offset the lower than expected growth created by higher churn, lower expansion rates, and sales force turnover in our cloud operations portfolio. We understand the root causes of these temporary headwinds, and, in FY 2023, our focus will be on returning these services to the growth trajectory we saw in the first three quarters of the year. We have made organizational changes to increase focus on renewal and expansion motions and will continue to refine our go-to-market activities to better address the cloud operations market. Additionally, we have refreshed the sales organization and strengthened the leadership team. We believe strongly in the sizable opportunity created by our cloud operations portfolio, where we bring differentiated enterprise capabilities to cloud infrastructure management, built on our long experience supporting a broad range of applications. Our differentiation in this space continues to receive third-party validation. Spot by NetApp was recognized as a leader and the only outperformer in GigaOm\u2019s Radar for Cloud Resource Optimization. As I noted earlier, our cloud storage services continue to perform well. Azure NetApp Files remains the standout here. Cloud Volumes Service for GCP and FSx for NetApp ONTAP also had strong growth in ARR and customer additions, albeit off small bases. We continue to deliver significant innovation to help customers get the most from their cloud storage environments. AWS announced FSx for ONTAP support for single availability zones, lowering storage costs and improving performance, as well as its inclusion in the EC2 launch wizard, streamlining the selection of FSx for ONTAP as file storage for customers creating a new compute instance. These new capabilities unlock new use cases, expanding the opportunity for FSx for ONTAP. Our cloud storage and data management services are complemented by our cloud operations infrastructure management and optimization functionality. Together, these capabilities deliver an industry-leading portfolio of multicloud infrastructure services for stateful and stateless workloads. Now we\u2019re enabling customers to deploy applications quickly, easily, and cost-effectively on that multi-cloud infrastructure for big data applications with Spark on Kubernetes, for managed desktops with Spot PC, and for open-source database, data pipeline and workflow applications with our most recent acquisition, Instaclustr. Instaclustr delivers open-source data and workflow applications as a fully managed service. Instaclustr will leverage our best-in-class infrastructure services, Cloud Volumes\u2019 storage optimization, Spot\u2019s compute optimization, and Cloud Insight\u2019s monitoring and troubleshooting \u2013 to make it easier and faster for customers to build, deploy and operate cloud applications. This will enable us to deliver more value to cloud operations teams and capture more revenue from those same buyers by delivering new services, as well as through the significant synergies with our cloud storage services. I am excited to welcome the Instaclustr team to the NetApp family. Overall, fiscal year 2022 was a good year for our cloud business. We doubled Public Cloud segment revenue from $199 million in fiscal year 2021 to $396 million in fiscal year 2022; we expanded our cloud partnerships and routes to market; introduced new, organic innovations; and we completed a number of acquisitions that position us well for the future. In the coming year, we will prioritize the integration of these services. To underscore our commitment here, we plan to slow the pace of acquisitions and reprioritize our use of cash in FY\u201923 to favor shareholder returns. Mike will provide the details in his commentary. I want to underscore that we remain convinced of the opportunity, the strength of our position and our ability to achieve $2 billion in ARR exiting fiscal year 26. Now turning to Hybrid Cloud. Demand for our Hybrid Cloud solutions remains high. Despite supply constraints that again impeded our ability to meet all customer demand, we grew product revenue 6% in the fourth quarter and 10% in fiscal year 2022. All flash array annualized revenue run rate grew 12% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Thanks to strong unit growth in FAS hybrid arrays, all flash penetration remained flat at 31% of installed systems. In Q4 we further enhanced our position in hybrid cloud with new innovations and recognition. We updated our object storage solution with security and compliance enhancements, Google Cloud integration, and faster performance for analytics workloads. We also announced the next generation of our collaboration with Cisco, FlexPod XCS for hybrid, multichord deployments. Additionally, Business Intelligence Group recognized NetApp AI as a winner of its Artificial Intelligence Excellence Award. Looking forward, our priorities are clear. We remain focused on capturing the substantial opportunity ahead as we scale our Public Cloud services, while continue to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud solutions. The long-term thesis we presented at our Investor Day of delivering value through sustained growth remains intact. The strong fundamentals of our business, including our alignment to customer priorities, strong balance sheet, and prudent operational management put NetApp in a position of strength. I want to underscore my confidence in our strategy, our execution, and the value we bring to all our stakeholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As we look back on Fiscal 2022, I am incredibly proud of the results the team delivered in an environment with such fluid and complex supply chain challenges. We delivered billings of $6.7 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, and grew revenue 10% to $6.3 billion. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, all-flash revenue grew 20% and object storage revenue grew 49%. We finished Fiscal 2022 with $505 million in Public Cloud ARR, with Public Cloud revenue growing 99% for the full year. We balanced strong growth in our key strategic areas with another year of disciplined investment delivering record operating margin of 23.7% up more than 3-points from last year, with an all-time high EPS of $5.28, up 30% year-over-year. In Q4, despite supply-constrained shipments, elevated freight and logistical expense, and component cost headwinds, we delivered solid revenue, with both gross margin and operating margin coming in above guidance. Strong execution yielded Q4 billings of $2 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.68 billion, up 8% year-over-year, including a 2-point headwind from FX. Our solid Q4 results were driven by continued strong demand for our all-flash and object storage solutions. Our Cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp delivering 3.5 of the 8 points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.56 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue into Fiscal 2023. Product revenue of $894 million increased 6% year-over-year. Software product revenue of $530 million increased 10% year-over-year, driven by the on-going mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Total Q4 recurring support revenue of $590 million increased 2% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q4 at $505 million, up 68% year-over-year, driven by strength in Cloud Storage, led by Azure NetApp Files. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $120 million, up 82% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. We didn\u2019t end the year as expected for Cloud ARR, but are confident that we remain well-positioned to deliver on the long-term Public Cloud opportunity. While it is not unusual for hypergrowth assets to hit air pockets along their journey, we are using this moment to learn, and continue to improve the operational rigor across the CloudOps products. Towards this goal, we are laser focused on using fiscal 2023 to strengthen our field and customer success go-to-market motion, while integrating our CloudOps product portfolio. Recurring support and public cloud revenue of $710 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 42% of total revenue. We ended Q4 with a record $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q4 marks the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 66% and came in solidly ahead of our guidance, reflecting better than expected product margins. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 65% in Q4. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 51%, as the supply chain team did an amazing job of mitigating a portion of the component cost headwinds, and our sales team was very focused on capturing our recent price increases. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 68% was again accretive to the overall corporate average. The sequential decline in Public Cloud gross margin was driven by lower than expected cloud revenue and incremental CapEx investment for Azure NetApp Files, which is a healthy leading demand signal. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as we continue to drive scale in cloud storage and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business being built on software solutions. Q4 highlighted the strong leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 23%, despite the ongoing supply chain headwinds. EPS of $1.42 was up 21% year-over-year, and even excluding a one-time tax-benefit of $0.12, represents a new Q4 record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $411 million and free cash flow was $343 million. The ongoing supply constraints resulted in shipments being pushed to the end of the quarter, leading to the highest ever accounts receivable balance of $1.2 billion exiting the year, an increase of $431 million from Q3. As a result, we expect healthy cash collections in the first half of fiscal 2023, which will be a tailwind to operating cash flow for the full year. During Q4, we repurchased $250 million in stock and paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $361 million to shareholders, representing 105% of free cash flow. We closed Q4 with $4.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now to guidance. In fiscal 2023, we are guiding revenues to grow 6% to 8% year-over-year, which includes a 2 percentage point headwind from FX. In fiscal 2023, we anticipate sustained demand for and continued share gain momentum in both our all-flash and object storage solutions, which we expect to drive product revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We will also continue to grow and invest in our Public Cloud business. We expect to exit fiscal 2023 with Public Cloud ARR of $780 million to $820 million, which includes approximately $40 million from our recently closed acquisition of Instaclustr. At the ARR mid-point, we expect our Public Cloud segment to drive four-points of total company revenue growth in fiscal 2023. As George noted, we remain confident in our ability to deliver $2 billion in Public Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2026. In fiscal 2023, we expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and logistical expenses from supply constraints continue to weigh on product margins. We expect first half product margins to be roughly consistent with Q4 levels. As we previously disclosed, we believe these cost headwinds are temporary in nature; and we believe that Q4 2022 is the trough for product margins. As you all know, the timing of getting completely through these supply chain challenges remains fluid, but we do expect cost improvements, coupled with our recent price increases, to be a modest tailwind to product margins as we head into the back-half of fiscal 2023. We anticipate operating margin to range between 23% and 24% for the full year, as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives, while maintaining a disciplined approach to spending. Our commitment is to again grow revenue faster than operating expenses in fiscal 2023. Moving down the P&L, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $30 million and our effective tax-rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%. Despite the considerable headwind to earnings as a result of the higher tax-rate, we are committed to delivering $5.40 to $5.60 in fiscal 2023 EPS. We expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal 2023, as we continue to drive incremental profitability in our hybrid cloud segment to fund the growth in our Public Cloud business. Free cash flow is expected to exceed $1.1 billion for the full year. Factored into the year-on-year free cash flow growth is a step-up in CapEx to approximately $250 million to $300 million. The higher CapEx forecast is being driven by three key items: one, additional capacity deployments in Azure and GCP; two, higher cloud software capitalization; and three, growing pipeline for our Keystone offering. As we've discussed before, additional capacity deployments within Azure and GCP are a healthy leading indicator for cloud storage demand. Generating over $1.1 billion in free cash flow will allow us to continue to deliver on our shareholder return commitments, while also investing in our key strategic areas. From a capital allocation perspective, we expect to hit pause on CloudOps acquisitions for the first half of fiscal 2023, as we focus on strengthening our field and customer success go-to-market motions, while integrating our CloudOps product portfolio. As a result, we plan to return 100% of fiscal 2023 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. We expect our quarterly dividend to remain at $0.50 per share throughout fiscal 2023 with the remainder of free cash flow allocated to share repurchases. We plan to front-end load these share repurchases, with $500 million coming in the first half of the year, which will reduce share count by 2% to 3% as we go through fiscal 2023. Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.475 billion and $1.625 billion which, at the midpoint implies a 6% increase year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to be approximately 21%. We anticipate our tax-rate to be between 21% and 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $1.05 and $1.15 per share. Assumed in our Q1 guidance is net interest expense of $10 million to $15 million and a share count of approximately 224 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding dedication, focus and hustle in delivering strong fiscal 2022 results in a very fluid environment. We remain disciplined and committed to the long-term thesis we shared with you as we continue to navigate the dynamic supply challenges to meet as much customer demand as possible. We are confident, enthusiastic and incredibly focused on our long-term strategic priorities and the tremendous growth opportunity we see over the next several years. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Based upon the results and your competitors who've also reported, it looks like NetApp has been gaining significant share, which is great. Is there anything in there that we should think about that would cause us to kind of pause or downshift that like any big recent design ins or acceptances? Or on the other hand with your sales force now fully ramped in the additional CapEx and things that Mike laid out, is there actually the potential you're looking at actually up-selling or up-shifting it to even a higher share gain in the future quarters? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think if you look at the dynamics of this past year, demand was strong and consistent throughout. We were gated by supply particularly in the back half of the year. That certainly was true even in Q4. We feel very good about our competitive position as we outlined at our financial Analyst Day and we continue to see cloud storage has been a really strong addition to the portfolio. The number of net new to NetApp customers meaning those that do not have our storage on premises that bought cloud storage continues to be strong. So we get to cross sell additional on premises workloads in the future. And I think with regard to the performance of our flash portfolio throughout the year and the growth of object, the second growth engine in our on premises portfolio, we feel really good. So thank you for the question, Jim.\nJim Suva: Thank you and congratulations.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks lot for taking my question. I guess George I was hoping to talk a little bit about some of the headwind that you saw on the cloud services side that impacted the AR number this quarter. I know you talked about three issues, maybe you can just elaborate on kind of what these things were and really the important part would be to understand your ability and conviction to resolve these and the timeline to resolve these. And my follow-up just related to the same question around is, when I think about the 60% growth rate you're implying on the cloud services for fiscal 2023, is there some linearity that I should be thinking about maybe the back half [Indiscernible] versus the first half that would be helpful as well? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I'll have Mike. Thanks for the question, Amit. I'll have Mike start walking you through the specifics. I'll talk about the remedies and then we'll come back to guidance.\nMike Berry: Perfect. Thank you, George. Amit, thanks for the question. So, hey, when we talked to you folks in February and we were looking at Q4, we had raised our expectations on the strength of Q3. We had expected Q4 to be largely consistent with what we saw in Q1, Q2, and Q3. And we expected to see some continued growth in Spot and Cloud Insights. We did know that there were some significant renewals in Cloud Insights. So as we went through the quarter, especially as we got into April, we saw increased churn in cloud insights. As you know, a good bit of the sale there are helping our customers move from their OCI, they're on-prem solution to the cloud solution, and some of them are still trying to find their way there. Spot. We saw lower expansion, as you know. We see \u2013 we have seen in the first three quarters a good bit of expansion in that business as they've deployed more into the cloud and that that didn't come through as expected. And then we did see higher sales and customer success turnover especially in the Spot group. So that's what happened in CloudOps. I'll now turn it back to George and I'll come back on your question on seasonality.\nGeorge Kurian: I think with regard to the remedies and the overall portfolio, listen we feel good about the customer adds across the portfolio. Cloud storage was a strong number. With regard to specifically how we're addressing the CloudOps portfolio we have refreshed the sales team, so a lot of the churn in the sales organization is behind us. We do have a newer set of members, so it'll take time to wrap them. We have brought on a new experienced leader for our Spot portfolio who led enterprise sales at Splunk. We have brought on as you might have seen a new Senior Vice President for Customer Success who was a Senior Executive at Informatica, and a leader for our renewals and customer success motion in the field who was the leader of that renewals and sales at Palo Alto. So much stronger team at the top with a focused mission around our CloudOps portfolio and driving renewals and customer success. A couple of other things that we've learned, right, we've learned that we need to integrate these acquisitions more quickly, particularly on the go-to market side and we are taking that lesson learned and applying that to our Instaclustr acquisition, as well as the work that we're doing to integrate the product portfolio more quickly, so that it's easier for customers to buy. Now, I'll have it back to Mike to talk about how that impacts guidance for next year.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. So Amit, on the numbers, I just want to walk that for you. So we ended the year in total ARR at $505 million. The midpoint of guidance is $800 million that does include $40 million from Instaclustr. So let's do the organic business first $505 million to $760 million at the midpoint, which implies about a 50% growth during the year. And then you add the $40 million exiting the year from Instaclustr that gets you to the $800 million. Hey as we go through the year, we feel really good about several drivers of growth that we should start to see accelerate as we go through fiscal 2023. Number one, we have added a good bit of sales capacity. You see it in the OpEx numbers, not only in 2022, but we will in the first half of 2023. We are excited about the ramp of FSx for on \u2013 FSx on-tap as well as GCP as we go through the year and have those become more meaningful contributors. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, we continue to invest a lot in the capacity for A&F specifically, and then a smaller pieces just as we resolve some of the items we talked about with CloudOps we think that that'll help the second half. So you should expect to see acceleration as we go through the year into the second half, and we feel really good about the $760 million number.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you very much for the clarity.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess George, in relation to your public cloud sort of the air pocket that you're seeing, it does look like you're implying that most of the headwinds have stemmed from a go to market sort of execution. Just wanted to sort of maybe ask for a bit more color there of what gives you confidence it's just a go-to-market approach, you have to sort of the decision to stop acquisitions, what gives you the clarity at this point that it's not a sort of additional services that you need to add to round out the portfolio. Sort of what's giving you that clarity it\u2019s just a go-to-market execution at this point? And I have a quick follow-up for Mike. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We saw strong adoption of our services. I think, as we mentioned in prepared remarks, a strong number of customer additions. I think the places where we can do a better job is really customer success and cross-sell and upsell, which is work that's in front of us. I think that also requires some integration work in the product portfolio to make it easier for the sales organization to do that cross-sell and upsell. Some of that integration work is completed. Others is in process, and you will see us integrating Instaclustr quickly into the NetApp portfolio, so that it can take advantage of all of our differentiated infrastructure services, Storage, Spot, Cloud Insights on we can hit the ground running pretty quickly with all of that differentiated platform behind them. So I would say within the quarter, it was mostly go-to-market execution. I think to aid the go-to-market team, we also have work to do on the product side, which we're accelerating and trying to accelerate the integration of Instaclustr into NetApp.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. Okay. And Mike, just a quick follow-up on gross margin sort of trajectory through the year. Is the improvement that you're implying sort of as you get into the back half, is that just more a function of the Public Cloud margins improving as you scale those revenues? Or are you expecting a similar improvement in Hybrid Cloud? And how much of that has to do with sort of pricing actions coming more materially through the P&L?\nMike Berry: Yes. Thanks for the question, Samik. So it's both of those. And let's take Hybrid Cloud first. So we do expect the margins, the product margins in Hybrid Cloud in the first half to be relatively consistent with Q4. We did say, hey, we thought Q4 was a trough. We still feel that way as we go through the year and then seeing some expansion in the back half driven by both the pricing actions that we took as well as all the work that's going on around supply chain, so both of those go into that number. And then from a Public Cloud perspective, there are several drivers of that increased gross margin that we've talked about; a) scaling that business as A&F scales and utilizes those assets better, more software and growth in that business. So it's both of those that will add to the margin and that breaks out apart. You'll also see when you go through the numbers; a) the cloud gross margins are starting to be a pretty significant contributor to the growth as we go into 2023 and beyond. So thank you for the question.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBala Reddy: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Bala Reddy on for Rod. I want to start with price increases. So it looks like they're starting to kick in. And from memory, I remember the price increases, magnitude is to the tune of high single digits or maybe 10% or in that range. Given this price increase, I'm wondering why wouldn't product revenues grow more than mid-single digit in fiscal 2023. Maybe there is an element of cautiousness in that guide, given the current macro uncertainty. I just thought you would help us understand a little bit better for us.\nGeorge Kurian: First of all, customers buy in dollars. And so whether we raise prices or not, their budgets are determined in dollars. And so if we raise prices, they'll buy fewer systems for the same dollars, right? I think that's the first. I think the second is, listen, we feel good about \u2013 really good about the work that our supply chain team has been doing on a year. We've had two successive quarters where we've been gated by supply rather than demand. We see a steady demand picture next year, this coming year, and we're just being realistic about how fast the supply chain constraint is. So buying in dollars and supply chain continue to be work in progress for us through the course of the year.\nBala Reddy: That helps, George. And just to make sure I get it. So you're not really baking in but any macro slowdown or anything in the back half of the year or at just more a function of supply chain shortages?\nGeorge Kurian: At the moment, we see demand to be steady and we are gated by supply. And so yes, we understand the economic environment is uncertain. We're managing what we can control. Our demand outlook has so far been really solid and we're gated by supply.\nBala Reddy: That's helpful. And a quick follow-up, if I may. Looking at Americas commercial mix, revenue mix in the quarter, it looks like it's only flat quarter-over-quarter, whereas it's typically up in Q4. And on the other hand, Asia Pacific has done really well in the quarter. I'm just wondering, are you seeing any kind of divergence or more of a magnitude \u2013 more of a function of allocating supply to different places?\nMike Berry: Yes. Hi, Bala. It's Mike. So it's really the supply chain gaining that revenue generation. And it varies by geo in terms of the product. So no significant changes from a geo perspective those what you see there is really supply chain gaining that rev.\nBala Reddy: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. You guys noted some success in hiring new sales reps during the quarter. Just wanted to get a sense of whether that was more backfilling or whether you've had some success on some of the hiring for the higher-level solution sales like or sales execs that can help with the cross-sell and upsell. And then maybe just kind of on the second point around the \u2013 replacing some of the sales execs that have left, just what do you see as the ramping time line for some of the new hires to productivity? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think the majority of our investment is focused on new sales reps with cloud backgrounds. We call them cloud sales specialists. So the types of execs, Meta, that you mentioned that know how to sell some of our application portfolio and cloud ops portfolio. So that's the majority. We also have had to replace some attrition in our frontline sales teams as well. And we continue to manage through that as a normal sort of course of business, right? I think the specific areas that we saw higher than anticipated attrition were really in our cloud ops portfolio. And I think we've done a good job sort of refreshing the team and also bringing on the new leadership team. I think when you look at the ramp time, it takes a few quarters, and that's why I think there's already been activity underway. We see that there will be some improvements through the first half. And then certainly, in the second half of the year, we should see the team being fully productive. In addition, given the ramp of our cloud business and the expectations of the ramp, we are continuing to invest in additional capacity, for example, in Cloud Storage and other areas. We will, of course, in line with our disciplined operating management philosophy, we don't see the growth tap on the brakes, but right now we feel that's a good investment to make.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. \nNik Todorov: Yes, thanks. And congrats on strong results, particularly given supply chain headwinds. Georg, a question maybe. I'm just curious, how have the conversations been over the last especially couple weeks when you talk with customers regarding their IT budgets in this environment? I think clearly there is a lot of headwinds like you talked in macro, and supply chain, and inflation, but there has been some recent third party surveys showing that budgets for IT are actually ticking up, not down and even if inflation pressure kind of persists. So just curious, what is the feedback that you're getting from CIOs and CFOs on those discussions for around the IT budgets? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think IT is continuing to be seen, as we've said, a spur for the transformation of the business. And so there are the strategic projects around customer experience, transformation, business process automation, a variety of those projects, better analytics continue to move forward. AI/ML projects, for example, we had a strong year and continue to see a strong outlook for that part of our business. So, so far as we've said the demand picture has been steady and we recognize that there is increased uncertainty, but I think so far the demand picture for IT spending within our customer base has remain steady.\nNik Todorov: Okay, great. And if I can follow-up Mike on the price increases, I just want to understand, do you envision incremental price increases, especially if you see further cost pressures through the year, or you think that you've kind of front loaded, the price increases and you just need to realize those as the year progresses?\nMike Berry: Yes, so thanks Nik. My answer to that would be, we are intently focused on realizing the ones that we, we put in place we're still working through those. So at this point, that's our focus we'll see what the rest of the year holds. Never say never, but our focus right now, Nik is realizing those other two price increases.\nNik Todorov: Go it. Thanks guys. Good luck. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. In terms of your billings, obviously very strong billings with over $2 billion for the quarter. It's always strong in the second half of the fiscal year, and that's also the case this past year. Are there any trends within the billings that you would highlight that suggest may be customers are putting in orders longer than they did historically because of maybe some concerns of supply constraints? Maybe just ask differently how do you monitor the health of these billings? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Hey Sidney it's Mike. So, great question. So thank you. So in Q4, we saw billings growth of 16%. As you know, billings is revenue plus change in deferred. Largely on a quarterly basis when you see billings and revenue come in differently, it's going to be driven by the timing of support, not only on point-of-sale, but also renewals. And that's exactly what happened in Q4. Keep in mind that a lot of our initial transactions will come with three years of maintenance. So you will get some variability on when those renew. So if you bifurcate the 16%, about 12% of that growth came through support renewals. And thankfully a lot of that was in software support. So that bodes well for all of us. And that was really based on the timing of some renewals, not only initial sales, but also renewals. So we watched that very carefully. We watched duration. And when you look at deferred revenue, you see some of that did go into long term. So we did see some longer term renewals typically related to initial sales. But we've seen that short term and long term deferred revenue percentage stay remarkably consistent. So that will jump around a little bit by quarter, nothing to be concerned about on this. It was a great quarter of billings and the nice part is that will translate into cash flow next year. So hopefully that helps.\nSidney Ho: Yes. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please. Go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Yes, maybe two if I could. First, on the all-flash array front still pretty good growth, but you mentioned install base is still not moving that much. So could you talk a little bit about what you think NetApp can do to further get that install base over to all-flash given the better economics all around for you? And then second, if I could just go back to the Cloud ARR, business could you talk a little bit about kind of better conversion of your installed base on-prem and what you're seeing from the other large on-prem players? And if they are trying to enter into this piece of the market as well. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: First of all, the installed base that we are penetrating is a very, very large installed base, and there are several factors that they consider as they look at new purchases, right, IT budgets, a mix of different system types. We did see a higher mix of our hybrid flash portfolio, where we have the only modern operating system that supports hybrid flash technology. In prior circumstances, when there was some uncertainty about budgets or economics, they would shift towards more of a value-oriented system, like a hybrid flash. So whether that's true or not, it's one data point, but we did see very strong hybrid flash unit shipments this quarter, which is why the total penetration into our install base was relatively flat. We continue to do the work to qualify more applications, more new workloads, and drive our field to go after new logos, as well as drive our install based conversion. There are incentives in place to sell new systems at a higher rate than renewals or refreshes, and those have been put in place for this year. And so I'm hopeful that that will drive more conversion. With regard to cloud ARR, I think, the main questions are, listen, we feel good about the acquisition of net new customers into our cloud portfolio. I think when we started the cloud journey, there was a concern that cloud growth would literally be offset by on-prem decline. We're not seeing that. And it's reflective of the strength of our portfolio on both fronts. And so, yes, could we do more to convert or install base to cloud? We have got incentives in place this year where the sales reps cannot make their number without selling cloud as a part of their overall kind of quota. And so there are discreet quotas set up for cloud, they have got to complete selling that to be able to accomplish their total compensation objectives. And so we've got work underway, we are doing enablements, but I do feel good about the fact that we are able to acquire a lot of net new customers. Those are our competitors' customers after all with our cloud storage portfolio.\nTim Long: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Just a quick question on the acquisition strategy. So before you decided to hit pause, can you kind of discuss how the pipeline was shaping up and how sort of the opportunities might have looked for that particular strategy given the re-pricing that we\u2019ve seen in both the public and the private markets. And when you think about the opportunity cost of pursuing \u2013 not pursuing transactions, how do we think that affects the ramp of the longer-term target in that sector or in that segment I should say? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think we\u2019ve had a disciplined acquisition strategy, right? We started with cloud storage. We enabled cloud storage to become multi-cloud across all the hyperscalers with both NetApp managed and native cloud services. We then added monitoring, which is cloud insights, organically taking one of our enterprise products and making it cloud ready and made that a multi-cloud monitoring service, so that customers could understand the performance of their applications. Then we brought in Spot, which gave us the compliment for compute that we had with storage, right, our organic storage. So now we\u2019ve got a multi-cloud infrastructure services portfolio that\u2019s truly unique in the market. And we are adding applications deliberately, right? So we\u2019re not trying to be in every application. We\u2019ve got specific applications that leverage the full portfolio of our infrastructure services. Spot PC for Virtual Desktop uses cloud volumes and Spot\u2019s computer optimization technology. We\u2019ve got spark for Kubernetes, which uses the Spot Ocean technology as part of its underlying infrastructure capability. And then most recently Instaclustr. I feel really good about the portfolio. Listen, we want to integrate these acquisitions so that they get off to a fast start. And I think we feel really good about our portfolio. If you look at the numbers that we are guiding to, I think if we hit, we finish FY2023 strong, we\u2019re in great shape to accomplish our $2 billion target. And we\u2019re just focused on, let\u2019s get these right in the first half of the year, and then we\u2019ll take a look at the market.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, George. And then Mike, maybe a follow-up for you on public cloud gross margin. What scale maybe can you give us a sense of scale that you need to get to your longer-term targets? Because even if I look before this quarter sort of the incremental gross margins, have been running in the low-70s as you invest in the business, and obviously there\u2019s some cost absorption issues, or maybe it\u2019s helpful if you can give us sort of an order of magnitude of what that Delta might look like from a margin perspective. So we could see the roadmap to that 75%-plus public cloud gross margin that you sort of targeted out there. Thanks.\nMike Berry: Yeah. Hey, thanks, David. So I want to answer that by saying, hey, by the time we get to a billion dollars in ARR, and I\u2019m going to break it up for you a little bit, we would certainly expect to see us getting very close to at least the bottom of that range. And there\u2019s two major drivers to that ramp. In CloudOps, the majority of those products are software cloud based as those continue to grow, they are accretive to not only cloud, but certainly the total company. And hey, the other big driver here is in cloud storage. We are continuing to invest a good bit for all the right reasons to drive growth in A&F and GCP. As we\u2019ve talked about when it comes after a couple years, as we start to modulate that CapEx investment, those are being depreciated over three years that depreciation\u2019s going to start to cap out. It\u2019s going to have a significant positive impact to gross margins because now we\u2019re going to benefit from utilizing those assets longer than their accounting life, because their useful life is quite a bit longer. So of all the stuff we\u2019ve talked about, I feel really good about getting to 75%, at least at the bottom end, because of all those items. And to your earlier question, acquisitions will focus around those software and cloud assets as well. So all of those things added together make me feel really good about that range.\nGeorge Kurian: If I were to just add one more\u2026\nDavid Vogt: Great. That\u2019s \u2013 yeah, that\u2019s helpful.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. Hey, if I were to just add one more FSx is this software only solution. So as that ramps, that\u2019s also accretive.\nMike Berry: Great point. Thank you.\nDavid Vogt: Yes, the clarification\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much for taking the question. First, I just wanted to see if maybe we can clarify what happened to gross margin for the public cloud in the quarter with the step down was there any new significant investments being made in terms of the deployed footprint ahead of revenue given that you\u2019re not facing the same kind of input cost issues that\u2019s just clarification. And then in terms of my longer-term question, I\u2019d like to see what you\u2019re hearing in terms of the demand side, that\u2019s influencing your forecast for the public cloud services revenue outlook. I heard a lot about the execution and the internal aspects, but I want to get a better understanding of the demand side of that equation. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Sure. So, hey, Simon, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll do the gross margin first. So a couple things, it did dip down a little bit from I believe 71% to 68%. There were two major drivers of that. Number one is a little bit lower revenue. Obviously there is some fixed costs in there. The other part is we\u2019ve continued to invest in the capacity specifically for A&F even though we are largely for our CapEx number for fiscal 2022 right about where we guided, there was a mix shift. Candidly, we spent less in facilities because I\u2019m going to bring up supply chain again. We had a little issues there that got pushed in 2023 and for all the good reasons, we actually deployed more capacity for A&F. Now that depreciation hits right away and then the ARR builds. So that those were the two major drivers. As we go through fiscal 2023, our goal is to get back to that 70%, Instaclustr will come in and call it mid-60s margin. And we expect that to fully get to about 70% exiting the year. And then as we continue to build ARR and leverage the existing footprint, that\u2019s why we feel good about getting back to 70% by the end of the year. So those are the margin puts and takes.\nGeorge Kurian: On demand, we feel good. Listen, we had strong customer adds across the portfolio in the quarter. We continue to see good dollar based net retention rates of 159%. So we feel good and we\u2019re really focused on going and capturing the demand. Cloud continues to be a place where we see customers prioritizing investment.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. On gross margins, you thought that 4Q would be the bottom in gross margins. I think you\u2019re saying that again today, but you\u2019re also saying first half will be roughly at the same level for this in the next quarter. If that the trajectory you had expected last quarter, or did things change that is causing you to bump along the trough margins for a longer time, especially given that fiscal 2Q, you typically have a much richer mix from federal that should be helping your gross margins take up higher, and I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think what we\u2019ve said is the first half of this coming year will be relatively similar to what we had in Q4, which is substantially better than what we \u2013 that we realized a substantially better outcome than what we feared going into the quarter. I think what we said in the second half of year is a modest tailwind to the first half of the year. We see improvements in the supply chain through the course of the year. I think COVID-related freight should get better. I think the amount of open market purchases should hopefully get better over time. I think we\u2019re being a little bit cautious about where we are in the course of the year, but overall I think that\u2019s the picture.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, George. And just as a clarification, I know you made several comments around PCS tracking a bit weaker than expected. But as you\u2019re mapping this onto longer term target, can you give you a thoughts around hitting pause on CloudOps M&A, which is a big part of the overall long-term guide. I mean, it\u2019s a substantial part of how you were originally getting to your long-term guide especially in light of the fact that valuation seem to come down you just did Instaclustr. Just wondering if, hitting the pause is more some cautiousness about the rate and pace of trajectory or is it about the speed of integrating some of these assets that you have acquired especially given the valuation compression that we\u2019ve seen in the market. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, we don\u2019t expect the valuation compression to go away, right. I think we see that as the start of the journey. And so we see plenty of opportunity ahead to do inorganic polls. I think the focus we\u2019re trying to bring is, first of all, in our outlook, we feel really good about the outlook. We wouldn\u2019t guide the year to a strong number if we didn\u2019t feel that way. We see continued strength in organic innovation, for example, cloud storage and cloud insights. We\u2019ve done a substantial number of acquisitions in CloudOps and we\u2019re going to take a little bit of time to integrate them on the product side and integrate them on the go-to-market. I think it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s fruited, it\u2019s disciplined and we\u2019ll be \u2013 we feel very, very good about our portfolio, not just in cloud storage, but in CloudOps as well.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ll try and slip in two real quick if I can. I guess, the first one is, one of your competitors tonight talked about, actually some customers pulling forward demand from the back half of the year into the first half of the year. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion around the backlog. And so I\u2019m curious, number one, have you seen any of that and how would you characterize the duration of kind of the backlog you\u2019re seeing and how maybe that\u2019s changed over the last two or three quarters?\nGeorge Kurian: We haven\u2019t seen any evidence of pull forwards or phantom demand. I think we have a close relationship with our customers. Every one of them has been quite balanced in terms of being a good citizen around, hey, we\u2019ll take some of our order and we\u2019ll wait for others. So I think we\u2019ve got a pretty balanced book of business. As we said, we\u2019ve had supply gate demand for two successive quarters, Q3 and Q4, very clearly saw the same pattern and backlog is elevated.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And this is a quick follow-up, a simple question. How would you characterize the competitive landscape? Dell EMC saw growth for the first time in a while this last quarter. How would you characterize what you\u2019re seeing competitively in the market?\nGeorge Kurian: I think it\u2019s pretty much the same, pure and NetApp taking share from Dell and HP and several other players. So I would characterize it as no fundamental change, to be honest. Thank you.\nAaron Rakers: Perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital. Please go ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes, thanks. I realize you guys are not economists here. But what do you think is the probability of IT CapEx down cycle, giving pricing financial conditions. And then what are your thoughts on NetApp share gain trajectory being stunted for help by a potential IT CapEx down cycle as well.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I\u2019ll just say, I\u2019m not an economist, right? We are in discussions with our customers. I would say, in every IT portfolio, there\u2019s probably projects that are strategic that will continue to be invested in regardless of supply chain constraints or economic environment or whatever it is, right. So I think those projects we see continuing, and we\u2019re going to be a part of those as much as we can. I think with regard to our competitive environment, listen, we are part of several mega trends that those will continue, right, cloud, data management, analytics, high performance computing environments. So long as we continue to innovate and stay focused. I think we\u2019ve got a good opportunity ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: And so just to be clear, you expect your share gain trajectory the help or stunted by a potential IT CapEx down cycle.\nGeorge Kurian: I think if there\u2019s an IT CapEx down cycle, what we generally see is within the IT spending envelope, transformational projects that are critical to business need will get prioritized. And so long as we are part of those projects, it\u2019s a share gain opportunity.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay, great. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And today\u2019s final question will come from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJason Ader: Great. Thank you. I guess, George, just to wrap up what lessons has NetApp learned from these last couple of years where you\u2019ve been kind of on an acquisition bench in this cloud services space. As you kind of reflect on what you could have done better and what you need to do better, maybe just kind of summarize your thoughts there for us.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I feel like we\u2019ve accomplished a lot, right? I think no one believed us when we said our cloud storage would be a native service in all of the three major hyperscale cloud providers. And we\u2019ve delivered on that. We said we would cross $500 million in cloud ARR and we\u2019ve delivered on that. We said cloud gross margins would be add or better than company average gross margins, we\u2019ve delivered on that. We said cloud would be a way for us to acquire a whole lot of net new customers, we\u2019ve delivered on that. And over the course of the last two years, we\u2019ve balanced organic innovation and there\u2019s been a substantial amount with complimentary deliberate acquisitions that allow us to serve a full customer\u2019s need right around an application portfolio. I think where we could do better is learn from the mistakes we made around integration, and we\u2019re going to \u2013 everybody learns from that and we\u2019re going to own that. And we\u2019re going to take \u2013 do the work that needed to integrate those acquisitions better in the first half of this year. But I don\u2019t think any of that diminishes from the opportunity in front of us or the place that we are. We\u2019re in a strong position and we\u2019re going to capitalize on it with disciplined execution.\nJason Ader: Very good. Good luck. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you. Before we close, we delivered a solid Q4 rounding out a strong FY2022 with the record levels of gross margin dollars operating income and earnings per share. Looking forward, we remain focused on capturing the substantial opportunity ahead as we scale our Public Cloud services while continue to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud solutions. I want to underscore my confidence in the long-term thesis, we presented at our Investor Day of delivering value through sustained growth. Our alignment to customer priorities, strong balance sheet and prudent operational management put NetApp in a position of strength. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As we look back on Fiscal 2022, I am incredibly proud of the results the team delivered in an environment with such fluid and complex supply chain challenges. We delivered billings of $6.7 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, and grew revenue 10% to $6.3 billion. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, all-flash revenue grew 20% and object storage revenue grew 49%. We finished Fiscal 2022 with $505 million in Public Cloud ARR, with Public Cloud revenue growing 99% for the full year. We balanced strong growth in our key strategic areas with another year of disciplined investment delivering record operating margin of 23.7% up more than 3-points from last year, with an all-time high EPS of $5.28, up 30% year-over-year. In Q4, despite supply-constrained shipments, elevated freight and logistical expense, and component cost headwinds, we delivered solid revenue, with both gross margin and operating margin coming in above guidance. Strong execution yielded Q4 billings of $2 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.68 billion, up 8% year-over-year, including a 2-point headwind from FX. Our solid Q4 results were driven by continued strong demand for our all-flash and object storage solutions. Our Cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp delivering 3.5 of the 8 points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.56 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue into Fiscal 2023. Product revenue of $894 million increased 6% year-over-year. Software product revenue of $530 million increased 10% year-over-year, driven by the on-going mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Total Q4 recurring support revenue of $590 million increased 2% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q4 at $505 million, up 68% year-over-year, driven by strength in Cloud Storage, led by Azure NetApp Files. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $120 million, up 82% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. We didn't end the year as expected for Cloud ARR, but are confident that we remain well-positioned to deliver on the long-term Public Cloud opportunity. While it is not unusual for hypergrowth assets to hit air pockets along their journey, we are using this moment to learn, and continue to improve the operational rigor across the CloudOps products. Towards this goal, we are laser focused on using fiscal 2023 to strengthen our field and customer success go-to-market motion, while integrating our CloudOps product portfolio. Recurring support and public cloud revenue of $710 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 42% of total revenue. We ended Q4 with a record $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q4 marks the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 66% and came in solidly ahead of our guidance, reflecting better than expected product margins. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 65% in Q4. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 51%, as the supply chain team did an amazing job of mitigating a portion of the component cost headwinds, and our sales team was very focused on capturing our recent price increases. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 68% was again accretive to the overall corporate average. The sequential decline in Public Cloud gross margin was driven by lower than expected cloud revenue and incremental CapEx investment for Azure NetApp Files, which is a healthy leading demand signal. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as we continue to drive scale in cloud storage and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business being built on software solutions. Q4 highlighted the strong leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 23%, despite the ongoing supply chain headwinds. EPS of $1.42 was up 21% year-over-year, and even excluding a one-time tax-benefit of $0.12, represents a new Q4 record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $411 million and free cash flow was $343 million. The ongoing supply constraints resulted in shipments being pushed to the end of the quarter, leading to the highest ever accounts receivable balance of $1.2 billion exiting the year, an increase of $431 million from Q3. As a result, we expect healthy cash collections in the first half of fiscal 2023, which will be a tailwind to operating cash flow for the full year. During Q4, we repurchased $250 million in stock and paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $361 million to shareholders, representing 105% of free cash flow. We closed Q4 with $4.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now to guidance. In fiscal 2023, we are guiding revenues to grow 6% to 8% year-over-year, which includes a 2 percentage point headwind from FX. In fiscal 2023, we anticipate sustained demand for and continued share gain momentum in both our all-flash and object storage solutions, which we expect to drive product revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We will also continue to grow and invest in our Public Cloud business. We expect to exit fiscal 2023 with Public Cloud ARR of $780 million to $820 million, which includes approximately $40 million from our recently closed acquisition of Instaclustr. At the ARR mid-point, we expect our Public Cloud segment to drive four-points of total company revenue growth in fiscal 2023. As George noted, we remain confident in our ability to deliver $2 billion in Public Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2026. In fiscal 2023, we expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and logistical expenses from supply constraints continue to weigh on product margins. We expect first half product margins to be roughly consistent with Q4 levels. As we previously disclosed, we believe these cost headwinds are temporary in nature; and we believe that Q4 2022 is the trough for product margins. As you all know, the timing of getting completely through these supply chain challenges remains fluid, but we do expect cost improvements, coupled with our recent price increases, to be a modest tailwind to product margins as we head into the back-half of fiscal 2023. We anticipate operating margin to range between 23% and 24% for the full year, as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives, while maintaining a disciplined approach to spending. Our commitment is to again grow revenue faster than operating expenses in fiscal 2023. Moving down the P&L, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $30 million and our effective tax-rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%. Despite the considerable headwind to earnings as a result of the higher tax-rate, we are committed to delivering $5.40 to $5.60 in fiscal 2023 EPS. We expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal 2023, as we continue to drive incremental profitability in our hybrid cloud segment to fund the growth in our Public Cloud business. Free cash flow is expected to exceed $1.1 billion for the full year. Factored into the year-on-year free cash flow growth is a step-up in CapEx to approximately $250 million to $300 million. The higher CapEx forecast is being driven by three key items: one, additional capacity deployments in Azure and GCP; two, higher cloud software capitalization; and three, growing pipeline for our Keystone offering. As we've discussed before, additional capacity deployments within Azure and GCP are a healthy leading indicator for cloud storage demand. Generating over $1.1 billion in free cash flow will allow us to continue to deliver on our shareholder return commitments, while also investing in our key strategic areas. From a capital allocation perspective, we expect to hit pause on CloudOps acquisitions for the first half of fiscal 2023, as we focus on strengthening our field and customer success go-to-market motions, while integrating our CloudOps product portfolio. As a result, we plan to return 100% of fiscal 2023 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. We expect our quarterly dividend to remain at $0.50 per share throughout fiscal 2023 with the remainder of free cash flow allocated to share repurchases. We plan to front-end load these share repurchases, with $500 million coming in the first half of the year, which will reduce share count by 2% to 3% as we go through fiscal 2023. Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.475 billion and $1.625 billion which, at the midpoint implies a 6% increase year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to be approximately 21%. We anticipate our tax-rate to be between 21% and 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $1.05 and $1.15 per share. Assumed in our Q1 guidance is net interest expense of $10 million to $15 million and a share count of approximately 224 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding dedication, focus and hustle in delivering strong fiscal 2022 results in a very fluid environment. We remain disciplined and committed to the long-term thesis we shared with you as we continue to navigate the dynamic supply challenges to meet as much customer demand as possible. We are confident, enthusiastic and incredibly focused on our long-term strategic priorities and the tremendous growth opportunity we see over the next several years. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Perfect. Thank you, George. Amit, thanks for the question. So, hey, when we talked to you folks in February and we were looking at Q4, we had raised our expectations on the strength of Q3. We had expected Q4 to be largely consistent with what we saw in Q1, Q2, and Q3. And we expected to see some continued growth in Spot and Cloud Insights. We did know that there were some significant renewals in Cloud Insights. So as we went through the quarter, especially as we got into April, we saw increased churn in cloud insights. As you know, a good bit of the sale there are helping our customers move from their OCI, they're on-prem solution to the cloud solution, and some of them are still trying to find their way there. Spot. We saw lower expansion, as you know. We see \u2013 we have seen in the first three quarters a good bit of expansion in that business as they've deployed more into the cloud and that that didn't come through as expected. And then we did see higher sales and customer success turnover especially in the Spot group. So that's what happened in CloudOps. I'll now turn it back to George and I'll come back on your question on seasonality. Thank you, George. So Amit, on the numbers, I just want to walk that for you. So we ended the year in total ARR at $505 million. The midpoint of guidance is $800 million that does include $40 million from Instaclustr. So let's do the organic business first $505 million to $760 million at the midpoint, which implies about a 50% growth during the year. And then you add the $40 million exiting the year from Instaclustr that gets you to the $800 million. Hey as we go through the year, we feel really good about several drivers of growth that we should start to see accelerate as we go through fiscal 2023. Number one, we have added a good bit of sales capacity. You see it in the OpEx numbers, not only in 2022, but we will in the first half of 2023. We are excited about the ramp of FSx for on \u2013 FSx on-tap as well as GCP as we go through the year and have those become more meaningful contributors. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, we continue to invest a lot in the capacity for A&F specifically, and then a smaller pieces just as we resolve some of the items we talked about with CloudOps we think that that'll help the second half. So you should expect to see acceleration as we go through the year into the second half, and we feel really good about the $760 million number. Thank you. Yes. Thanks for the question, Samik. So it's both of those. And let's take Hybrid Cloud first. So we do expect the margins, the product margins in Hybrid Cloud in the first half to be relatively consistent with Q4. We did say, hey, we thought Q4 was a trough. We still feel that way as we go through the year and then seeing some expansion in the back half driven by both the pricing actions that we took as well as all the work that's going on around supply chain, so both of those go into that number. And then from a Public Cloud perspective, there are several drivers of that increased gross margin that we've talked about; a) scaling that business as A&F scales and utilizes those assets better, more software and growth in that business. So it's both of those that will add to the margin and that breaks out apart. You'll also see when you go through the numbers; a) the cloud gross margins are starting to be a pretty significant contributor to the growth as we go into 2023 and beyond. So thank you for the question. Yes. Hi, Bala. It's Mike. So it's really the supply chain gaining that revenue generation. And it varies by geo in terms of the product. So no significant changes from a geo perspective those what you see there is really supply chain gaining that rev. Yes, so thanks Nik. My answer to that would be, we are intently focused on realizing the ones that we, we put in place we're still working through those. So at this point, that's our focus we'll see what the rest of the year holds. Never say never, but our focus right now, Nik is realizing those other two price increases. Hey Sidney it's Mike. So, great question. So thank you. So in Q4, we saw billings growth of 16%. As you know, billings is revenue plus change in deferred. Largely on a quarterly basis when you see billings and revenue come in differently, it's going to be driven by the timing of support, not only on point-of-sale, but also renewals. And that's exactly what happened in Q4. Keep in mind that a lot of our initial transactions will come with three years of maintenance. So you will get some variability on when those renew. So if you bifurcate the 16%, about 12% of that growth came through support renewals. And thankfully a lot of that was in software support. So that bodes well for all of us. And that was really based on the timing of some renewals, not only initial sales, but also renewals. So we watched that very carefully. We watched duration. And when you look at deferred revenue, you see some of that did go into long term. So we did see some longer term renewals typically related to initial sales. But we've seen that short term and long term deferred revenue percentage stay remarkably consistent. So that will jump around a little bit by quarter, nothing to be concerned about on this. It was a great quarter of billings and the nice part is that will translate into cash flow next year. So hopefully that helps. Yeah. Hey, thanks, David. So I want to answer that by saying, hey, by the time we get to a billion dollars in ARR, and I'm going to break it up for you a little bit, we would certainly expect to see us getting very close to at least the bottom of that range. And there's two major drivers to that ramp. In CloudOps, the majority of those products are software cloud based as those continue to grow, they are accretive to not only cloud, but certainly the total company. And hey, the other big driver here is in cloud storage. We are continuing to invest a good bit for all the right reasons to drive growth in A&F and GCP. As we've talked about when it comes after a couple years, as we start to modulate that CapEx investment, those are being depreciated over three years that depreciation's going to start to cap out. It's going to have a significant positive impact to gross margins because now we're going to benefit from utilizing those assets longer than their accounting life, because their useful life is quite a bit longer. So of all the stuff we've talked about, I feel really good about getting to 75%, at least at the bottom end, because of all those items. And to your earlier question, acquisitions will focus around those software and cloud assets as well. So all of those things added together make me feel really good about that range. Great point. Thank you. Sure. So, hey, Simon, it's Mike. I'll do the gross margin first. So a couple things, it did dip down a little bit from I believe 71% to 68%. There were two major drivers of that. Number one is a little bit lower revenue. Obviously there is some fixed costs in there. The other part is we've continued to invest in the capacity specifically for A&F even though we are largely for our CapEx number for fiscal 2022 right about where we guided, there was a mix shift. Candidly, we spent less in facilities because I'm going to bring up supply chain again. We had a little issues there that got pushed in 2023 and for all the good reasons, we actually deployed more capacity for A&F. Now that depreciation hits right away and then the ARR builds. So that those were the two major drivers. As we go through fiscal 2023, our goal is to get back to that 70%, Instaclustr will come in and call it mid-60s margin. And we expect that to fully get to about 70% exiting the year. And then as we continue to build ARR and leverage the existing footprint, that's why we feel good about getting back to 70% by the end of the year. So those are the margin puts and takes."

            "content": "Thank you, Kris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. Our solid fourth quarter results cap off a strong year. We made sustained progress against our strategic goals, successfully achieving our commitment to grow the business while delivering operating leverage in fiscal 2022. We gained share in enterprise storage with strong growth in all-flash array and object storage products. We expanded our public cloud business with robust expansion of customers, ARR, innovation, and routes to market. And, most notably, we delivered record levels of gross margin dollars, operating income, and earnings per share. While the demand environment remains strong, macroeconomic uncertainty, including supply constraints, rising interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical conflict, has increased since we last spoke with you at our Investor Day in March. Navigating this complex and dynamic environment is testing our teams, and we are sharply focused on managing what is in our control. Backlog is elevated due to supply constraints, despite our excellent supply chain management helping us meet as much of the demand as possible. I want to thank our global team for their disciplined execution and agile response to changing conditions. That we achieved all-time highs for gross margin dollars, operating income, and earnings per share in the face of these headwinds demonstrates our disciplined operating management. The turbulent environment also creates challenges for our customers, raising the urgency for data driven digital and cloud transformations. We sit at the intersection of these megatrends, as the complexities created by rapid data growth, multi-cloud management, and the adoption of next-gen technologies such as AI, cloud native, and modern application and data infrastructures create a sizeable opportunity for us. At our Investor Day, we outlined our objective to deliver long-term value through sustained growth and that thesis remains unchanged. Our critical role in helping customers achieve their transformation goals underpins our strategy and drives confidence for future growth. Public Cloud ARR of $505 million grew 68% year-over-year and the Q4 dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains strong at 159%. Before I get to the many highlights of the quarter, I want to address the fact that our Public Cloud ARR came short of our expectations. Demand for our cloud storage solutions was strong in Q4. We also saw a healthy number of new customer additions across both cloud storage and cloud operations services in the quarter. Unfortunately, these tailwinds were not enough to offset the lower than expected growth created by higher churn, lower expansion rates, and sales force turnover in our cloud operations portfolio. We understand the root causes of these temporary headwinds, and, in FY 2023, our focus will be on returning these services to the growth trajectory we saw in the first three quarters of the year. We have made organizational changes to increase focus on renewal and expansion motions and will continue to refine our go-to-market activities to better address the cloud operations market. Additionally, we have refreshed the sales organization and strengthened the leadership team. We believe strongly in the sizable opportunity created by our cloud operations portfolio, where we bring differentiated enterprise capabilities to cloud infrastructure management, built on our long experience supporting a broad range of applications. Our differentiation in this space continues to receive third-party validation. Spot by NetApp was recognized as a leader and the only outperformer in GigaOm's Radar for Cloud Resource Optimization. As I noted earlier, our cloud storage services continue to perform well. Azure NetApp Files remains the standout here. Cloud Volumes Service for GCP and FSx for NetApp ONTAP also had strong growth in ARR and customer additions, albeit off small bases. We continue to deliver significant innovation to help customers get the most from their cloud storage environments. AWS announced FSx for ONTAP support for single availability zones, lowering storage costs and improving performance, as well as its inclusion in the EC2 launch wizard, streamlining the selection of FSx for ONTAP as file storage for customers creating a new compute instance. These new capabilities unlock new use cases, expanding the opportunity for FSx for ONTAP. Our cloud storage and data management services are complemented by our cloud operations infrastructure management and optimization functionality. Together, these capabilities deliver an industry-leading portfolio of multicloud infrastructure services for stateful and stateless workloads. Now we're enabling customers to deploy applications quickly, easily, and cost-effectively on that multi-cloud infrastructure for big data applications with Spark on Kubernetes, for managed desktops with Spot PC, and for open-source database, data pipeline and workflow applications with our most recent acquisition, Instaclustr. Instaclustr delivers open-source data and workflow applications as a fully managed service. Instaclustr will leverage our best-in-class infrastructure services, Cloud Volumes' storage optimization, Spot's compute optimization, and Cloud Insight's monitoring and troubleshooting \u2013 to make it easier and faster for customers to build, deploy and operate cloud applications. This will enable us to deliver more value to cloud operations teams and capture more revenue from those same buyers by delivering new services, as well as through the significant synergies with our cloud storage services. I am excited to welcome the Instaclustr team to the NetApp family. Overall, fiscal year 2022 was a good year for our cloud business. We doubled Public Cloud segment revenue from $199 million in fiscal year 2021 to $396 million in fiscal year 2022; we expanded our cloud partnerships and routes to market; introduced new, organic innovations; and we completed a number of acquisitions that position us well for the future. In the coming year, we will prioritize the integration of these services. To underscore our commitment here, we plan to slow the pace of acquisitions and reprioritize our use of cash in FY'23 to favor shareholder returns. Mike will provide the details in his commentary. I want to underscore that we remain convinced of the opportunity, the strength of our position and our ability to achieve $2 billion in ARR exiting fiscal year 26. Now turning to Hybrid Cloud. Demand for our Hybrid Cloud solutions remains high. Despite supply constraints that again impeded our ability to meet all customer demand, we grew product revenue 6% in the fourth quarter and 10% in fiscal year 2022. All flash array annualized revenue run rate grew 12% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Thanks to strong unit growth in FAS hybrid arrays, all flash penetration remained flat at 31% of installed systems. In Q4 we further enhanced our position in hybrid cloud with new innovations and recognition. We updated our object storage solution with security and compliance enhancements, Google Cloud integration, and faster performance for analytics workloads. We also announced the next generation of our collaboration with Cisco, FlexPod XCS for hybrid, multichord deployments. Additionally, Business Intelligence Group recognized NetApp AI as a winner of its Artificial Intelligence Excellence Award. Looking forward, our priorities are clear. We remain focused on capturing the substantial opportunity ahead as we scale our Public Cloud services, while continue to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud solutions. The long-term thesis we presented at our Investor Day of delivering value through sustained growth remains intact. The strong fundamentals of our business, including our alignment to customer priorities, strong balance sheet, and prudent operational management put NetApp in a position of strength. I want to underscore my confidence in our strategy, our execution, and the value we bring to all our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. I think if you look at the dynamics of this past year, demand was strong and consistent throughout. We were gated by supply particularly in the back half of the year. That certainly was true even in Q4. We feel very good about our competitive position as we outlined at our financial Analyst Day and we continue to see cloud storage has been a really strong addition to the portfolio. The number of net new to NetApp customers meaning those that do not have our storage on premises that bought cloud storage continues to be strong. So we get to cross sell additional on premises workloads in the future. And I think with regard to the performance of our flash portfolio throughout the year and the growth of object, the second growth engine in our on premises portfolio, we feel really good. So thank you for the question, Jim. Thank you. I'll have Mike. Thanks for the question, Amit. I'll have Mike start walking you through the specifics. I'll talk about the remedies and then we'll come back to guidance. I think with regard to the remedies and the overall portfolio, listen we feel good about the customer adds across the portfolio. Cloud storage was a strong number. With regard to specifically how we're addressing the CloudOps portfolio we have refreshed the sales team, so a lot of the churn in the sales organization is behind us. We do have a newer set of members, so it'll take time to wrap them. We have brought on a new experienced leader for our Spot portfolio who led enterprise sales at Splunk. We have brought on as you might have seen a new Senior Vice President for Customer Success who was a Senior Executive at Informatica, and a leader for our renewals and customer success motion in the field who was the leader of that renewals and sales at Palo Alto. So much stronger team at the top with a focused mission around our CloudOps portfolio and driving renewals and customer success. A couple of other things that we've learned, right, we've learned that we need to integrate these acquisitions more quickly, particularly on the go-to market side and we are taking that lesson learned and applying that to our Instaclustr acquisition, as well as the work that we're doing to integrate the product portfolio more quickly, so that it's easier for customers to buy. Now, I'll have it back to Mike to talk about how that impacts guidance for next year. We saw strong adoption of our services. I think, as we mentioned in prepared remarks, a strong number of customer additions. I think the places where we can do a better job is really customer success and cross-sell and upsell, which is work that's in front of us. I think that also requires some integration work in the product portfolio to make it easier for the sales organization to do that cross-sell and upsell. Some of that integration work is completed. Others is in process, and you will see us integrating Instaclustr quickly into the NetApp portfolio, so that it can take advantage of all of our differentiated infrastructure services, Storage, Spot, Cloud Insights on we can hit the ground running pretty quickly with all of that differentiated platform behind them. So I would say within the quarter, it was mostly go-to-market execution. I think to aid the go-to-market team, we also have work to do on the product side, which we're accelerating and trying to accelerate the integration of Instaclustr into NetApp. First of all, customers buy in dollars. And so whether we raise prices or not, their budgets are determined in dollars. And so if we raise prices, they'll buy fewer systems for the same dollars, right? I think that's the first. I think the second is, listen, we feel good about \u2013 really good about the work that our supply chain team has been doing on a year. We've had two successive quarters where we've been gated by supply rather than demand. We see a steady demand picture next year, this coming year, and we're just being realistic about how fast the supply chain constraint is. So buying in dollars and supply chain continue to be work in progress for us through the course of the year. At the moment, we see demand to be steady and we are gated by supply. And so yes, we understand the economic environment is uncertain. We're managing what we can control. Our demand outlook has so far been really solid and we're gated by supply. I think the majority of our investment is focused on new sales reps with cloud backgrounds. We call them cloud sales specialists. So the types of execs, Meta, that you mentioned that know how to sell some of our application portfolio and cloud ops portfolio. So that's the majority. We also have had to replace some attrition in our frontline sales teams as well. And we continue to manage through that as a normal sort of course of business, right? I think the specific areas that we saw higher than anticipated attrition were really in our cloud ops portfolio. And I think we've done a good job sort of refreshing the team and also bringing on the new leadership team. I think when you look at the ramp time, it takes a few quarters, and that's why I think there's already been activity underway. We see that there will be some improvements through the first half. And then certainly, in the second half of the year, we should see the team being fully productive. In addition, given the ramp of our cloud business and the expectations of the ramp, we are continuing to invest in additional capacity, for example, in Cloud Storage and other areas. We will, of course, in line with our disciplined operating management philosophy, we don't see the growth tap on the brakes, but right now we feel that's a good investment to make. I think IT is continuing to be seen, as we've said, a spur for the transformation of the business. And so there are the strategic projects around customer experience, transformation, business process automation, a variety of those projects, better analytics continue to move forward. AI/ML projects, for example, we had a strong year and continue to see a strong outlook for that part of our business. So, so far as we've said the demand picture has been steady and we recognize that there is increased uncertainty, but I think so far the demand picture for IT spending within our customer base has remain steady. Thank you. First of all, the installed base that we are penetrating is a very, very large installed base, and there are several factors that they consider as they look at new purchases, right, IT budgets, a mix of different system types. We did see a higher mix of our hybrid flash portfolio, where we have the only modern operating system that supports hybrid flash technology. In prior circumstances, when there was some uncertainty about budgets or economics, they would shift towards more of a value-oriented system, like a hybrid flash. So whether that's true or not, it's one data point, but we did see very strong hybrid flash unit shipments this quarter, which is why the total penetration into our install base was relatively flat. We continue to do the work to qualify more applications, more new workloads, and drive our field to go after new logos, as well as drive our install based conversion. There are incentives in place to sell new systems at a higher rate than renewals or refreshes, and those have been put in place for this year. And so I'm hopeful that that will drive more conversion. With regard to cloud ARR, I think, the main questions are, listen, we feel good about the acquisition of net new customers into our cloud portfolio. I think when we started the cloud journey, there was a concern that cloud growth would literally be offset by on-prem decline. We're not seeing that. And it's reflective of the strength of our portfolio on both fronts. And so, yes, could we do more to convert or install base to cloud? We have got incentives in place this year where the sales reps cannot make their number without selling cloud as a part of their overall kind of quota. And so there are discreet quotas set up for cloud, they have got to complete selling that to be able to accomplish their total compensation objectives. And so we've got work underway, we are doing enablements, but I do feel good about the fact that we are able to acquire a lot of net new customers. Those are our competitors' customers after all with our cloud storage portfolio. Listen, I think we've had a disciplined acquisition strategy, right? We started with cloud storage. We enabled cloud storage to become multi-cloud across all the hyperscalers with both NetApp managed and native cloud services. We then added monitoring, which is cloud insights, organically taking one of our enterprise products and making it cloud ready and made that a multi-cloud monitoring service, so that customers could understand the performance of their applications. Then we brought in Spot, which gave us the compliment for compute that we had with storage, right, our organic storage. So now we've got a multi-cloud infrastructure services portfolio that's truly unique in the market. And we are adding applications deliberately, right? So we're not trying to be in every application. We've got specific applications that leverage the full portfolio of our infrastructure services. Spot PC for Virtual Desktop uses cloud volumes and Spot's computer optimization technology. We've got spark for Kubernetes, which uses the Spot Ocean technology as part of its underlying infrastructure capability. And then most recently Instaclustr. I feel really good about the portfolio. Listen, we want to integrate these acquisitions so that they get off to a fast start. And I think we feel really good about our portfolio. If you look at the numbers that we are guiding to, I think if we hit, we finish FY2023 strong, we're in great shape to accomplish our $2 billion target. And we're just focused on, let's get these right in the first half of the year, and then we'll take a look at the market. If I were to just add one more... Yes. Hey, if I were to just add one more FSx is this software only solution. So as that ramps, that's also accretive. On demand, we feel good. Listen, we had strong customer adds across the portfolio in the quarter. We continue to see good dollar based net retention rates of 159%. So we feel good and we're really focused on going and capturing the demand. Cloud continues to be a place where we see customers prioritizing investment. Listen, I think what we've said is the first half of this coming year will be relatively similar to what we had in Q4, which is substantially better than what we \u2013 that we realized a substantially better outcome than what we feared going into the quarter. I think what we said in the second half of year is a modest tailwind to the first half of the year. We see improvements in the supply chain through the course of the year. I think COVID-related freight should get better. I think the amount of open market purchases should hopefully get better over time. I think we're being a little bit cautious about where we are in the course of the year, but overall I think that's the picture. Listen, we don't expect the valuation compression to go away, right. I think we see that as the start of the journey. And so we see plenty of opportunity ahead to do inorganic polls. I think the focus we're trying to bring is, first of all, in our outlook, we feel really good about the outlook. We wouldn't guide the year to a strong number if we didn't feel that way. We see continued strength in organic innovation, for example, cloud storage and cloud insights. We've done a substantial number of acquisitions in CloudOps and we're going to take a little bit of time to integrate them on the product side and integrate them on the go-to-market. I think it's just \u2013 it's fruited, it's disciplined and we'll be \u2013 we feel very, very good about our portfolio, not just in cloud storage, but in CloudOps as well. We haven't seen any evidence of pull forwards or phantom demand. I think we have a close relationship with our customers. Every one of them has been quite balanced in terms of being a good citizen around, hey, we'll take some of our order and we'll wait for others. So I think we've got a pretty balanced book of business. As we said, we've had supply gate demand for two successive quarters, Q3 and Q4, very clearly saw the same pattern and backlog is elevated. I think it's pretty much the same, pure and NetApp taking share from Dell and HP and several other players. So I would characterize it as no fundamental change, to be honest. Thank you. Listen, I'll just say, I'm not an economist, right? We are in discussions with our customers. I would say, in every IT portfolio, there's probably projects that are strategic that will continue to be invested in regardless of supply chain constraints or economic environment or whatever it is, right. So I think those projects we see continuing, and we're going to be a part of those as much as we can. I think with regard to our competitive environment, listen, we are part of several mega trends that those will continue, right, cloud, data management, analytics, high performance computing environments. So long as we continue to innovate and stay focused. I think we've got a good opportunity ahead. I think if there's an IT CapEx down cycle, what we generally see is within the IT spending envelope, transformational projects that are critical to business need will get prioritized. And so long as we are part of those projects, it's a share gain opportunity. Thank you. Listen, I feel like we've accomplished a lot, right? I think no one believed us when we said our cloud storage would be a native service in all of the three major hyperscale cloud providers. And we've delivered on that. We said we would cross $500 million in cloud ARR and we've delivered on that. We said cloud gross margins would be add or better than company average gross margins, we've delivered on that. We said cloud would be a way for us to acquire a whole lot of net new customers, we've delivered on that. And over the course of the last two years, we've balanced organic innovation and there's been a substantial amount with complimentary deliberate acquisitions that allow us to serve a full customer's need right around an application portfolio. I think where we could do better is learn from the mistakes we made around integration, and we're going to \u2013 everybody learns from that and we're going to own that. And we're going to take \u2013 do the work that needed to integrate those acquisitions better in the first half of this year. But I don't think any of that diminishes from the opportunity in front of us or the place that we are. We're in a strong position and we're going to capitalize on it with disciplined execution. Thank you. Before we close, we delivered a solid Q4 rounding out a strong FY2022 with the record levels of gross margin dollars operating income and earnings per share. Looking forward, we remain focused on capturing the substantial opportunity ahead as we scale our Public Cloud services while continue to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud solutions. I want to underscore my confidence in the long-term thesis, we presented at our Investor Day of delivering value through sustained growth. Our alignment to customer priorities, strong balance sheet and prudent operational management put NetApp in a position of strength. Thank you."

During the call all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to our Q3 FY 2022 earnings call. We delivered another outstanding quarter, building on the momentum we\u2019ve had in recent periods. Demand for our solutions is strong and powered by the alignment of our differentiated technology portfolio with customer priorities. In Q3, our focused execution delivered: double-digit revenue growth, led by the impressive performance of our Public Cloud Services and All-flash array businesses; record high gross margin dollars, operating income, and earnings per share. NetApp plays a critical role in helping customers achieve their business and cloud transformation goals. I am pleased that our differentiation here continues to receive third-party validation by industry leaders, independent analysts, and existing and new customers. We were recognized by Amazon Web Services for our achievements as an AWS partner. NetApp was named the 2021 AWS Independent Software Vendor Design Partner of the Year \u2013 U.S., for the jointly engineered and natively integrated Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP service. Additionally, GigaOm called out NetApp as the only vendor with a multi-cloud strategy and execution that translates to a continuous data management plane across clouds and locations, a comprehensive enterprise-grade feature set, and flexible deployment options. We were listed as a leader in three GigaOm Radar reports: Cloud File Systems, Primary Storage for Large Enterprises, and Enterprise Scale-Out File Systems. Not only are we a leader in each category, we are the only vendor to lead in all three. This recognition spotlights the value we bring to our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys. Customers are also endorsing our value, creating strong demand for solutions in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment was driven by continued strength in object storage and All-flash arrays. Our All-flash array business hit another milestone in Q3, with a record high annualized run rate of $3.2 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year. All-flash array penetration of our installed base ticked up another point to 31% of installed base systems, giving us substantial headroom to continue to help existing and new customers modernize their storage environments with cloud-connected flash arrays. We further enhanced our position with the introduction of the AFF A900, which delivers unified support for file, block, and object protocols, built-in data protection with cutting-edge anti-ransomware capabilities, and the high performance and resiliency required to support the most critical business workloads. Public Cloud ARR grew to $469 million, an increase of 98% year-over-year, including the benefit from the CloudCheckr acquisition which closed early in Q3. Public Cloud dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains healthy at 169%, as customers increase their usage of our public cloud services and adopt new products. The expanded market reach from our cloud partners and the broadening participation of our field sales organization has delivered outstanding performance in our Public Cloud segment this year, which puts us well ahead of our plan to achieve $1 billion in ARR in fiscal year 2025. We, uniquely, have fully integrated services with all the major public cloud providers. I am pleased with the level of engagement from our cloud partners and with the performance of our Cloud Storage services. Azure NetApp Files again grew ahead of plan; Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud is ramping nicely; and, while still very early days, we are seeing lots of proofs of concept and activity with AWS FSx for NetApp ONTAP. Our differentiated CloudOps portfolio for multi-cloud infrastructure management is also growing well, led by Spot and Cloud Insights. It is expanding our addressable market, and opening opportunities with new buyers at existing customers and with new customers as we help them reduce the cost and complexity of managing their rapidly growing cloud environments. We are delivering innovation at cloud speed and enhancing our solutions to address the needs of cloud natives and born-in-the-cloud applications. We've made Cloud Backup Kubernetes aware and broaden Spot Ocean with automated cloud infrastructure and application management for Apache Spark and Ocean CD, enabling faster deployment of Kubernetes applications with end-to-end visibility and management. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the CloudCheckr acquisition early in Q3. CloudCheckr complements the FinOps capabilities of Spot with the multi-cloud reports, analytics and governance needed to plan, manage and optimize cloud costs to ensure organizations get the most out of their cloud investment. We continue the rapid pace of organic and inorganic innovation with today's announcement of the acquisition of Fylamynt. Fylamynt extends our leadership in cloud operations. Adding Fylamynt's cloud automation technology to the Spot platform will make it easy for customers to integrate Spot solutions with their existing tools, processes and infrastructure code. This will accelerate their ability to take advantage of Spot's suite of capabilities for understanding and optimizing their cloud infrastructure. I'm excited to welcome the Fylamynt team to NetApp. As I've said many times, our strategy to help customers deal with the challenges of managing data and applications in hybrid multi-cloud environments is helping us expand our business by winning new customers and displacing the competition. A global third-party logistics company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to host data migrated from Nutanix systems in its data centers. They chose NetApp-based cloud services for our resiliency, cost efficiency and multi-protocol support. This win marks a new logo for us and has already created additional opportunity for Cloud Manager and Cloud Insights. Another new customer win came from a multinational energy infrastructure company, who chose Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure to migrate workloads away from on-premises Dell systems. They are now considering replacing expired Dell systems with on-premises NetApp systems to make it easier to move data across environments in the future. We had a first-time win at an international government agency with Spot Eco to optimize its multimillion-dollar cloud spend. This win becomes a lighthouse reference account for us which we can leverage to reach into other related agencies. In summary, our strong Q3 results underscore our unique position in solving organization's most significant challenges in both cloud-native and traditional applications, on-premises and in hybrid multi-cloud environments. First, we help customers simplify and modernize existing data centers and deploy traditional applications quickly and confidently. Second, we help customers adopt modern application architectures like Kubernetes and microservices for new workloads and deploy data-rich applications like machine and deep learning. And third, we help customers optimize cost, performance, availability and security for applications and associated infrastructure across multiple clouds. The complexities created by rapid data growth, multi-cloud management and the adoption of next-gen technologies creates a sizable opportunity for us with focused execution, I am confident in our ability to capture that opportunity and deliver continued growth. We're holding an Investor Day on March 22, where we'll talk more about our growth opportunity and our plans to drive shareholder value. You can register at investors.netapp.com. If you have any questions, please reach out to the IR team. Before I turn the call over to Mike to walk you through the numbers, I want to take a moment to welcome Harv Bhela to NetApp as our Chief Product Officer. Harv brings with him more than 25 years of experience building industry-defining software categories and cloud services. I also want to thank Brad Anderson for his leadership and wish him well in his retirement. With that, I'll hand it over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion. Number one, Q3 was another strong quarter, with all-time company highs in gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS as our business model continues to show significant operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins. Number two, our cloud business had another outstanding quarter. We clearly are solidly ahead of our original plan to hit our $1 billion ARR target in fiscal 2025. Number three, we are prioritizing meeting as much customer demand as possible as we navigate near-term component shortages and expect revenue to continue to be constrained in Q4. And number four, we are increasing our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and Public Cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q3 and a very healthy demand backdrop for Q4. Now to the details. In fiscal Q3, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and operating leverage across the entire business. Outstanding execution by the NetApp team yielded Q3 billings of $1.76 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.61 billion, also up 10% year-over-year. Our solid Q3 results were driven by continued strong demand across both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.5 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue into Q4 and throughout fiscal 2023. Product revenue of $846 million increased 9% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we've seen over the last two quarters, software product revenue of $507 million increased 18% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Total Q3 recurring support revenue of $586 million increased 3% year-over-year. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue run rate, which includes both product and support revenue, eclipsed $3.2 billion for the first time in the company's history, and was up 23% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited Q3 at $469 million, up 98% strong growth in Azure NetApp Files, Spot and Cloud Insights, with CloudCheckr contributing $35 million in ARR. Organic public cloud ARR, excluding $434 million in Q3, up 83% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $110 million, up 100% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. The growing scale of our Public Cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering four of the 10 points in revenue growth. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $696 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. When combined, software product revenue, recurring support and Public Cloud revenue totaled $1.2 billion, another company high and increased 14% year-over-year, representing 75% of total revenue, up from 72% in Q3 2021. We ended Q3 with $4 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Q3 marks the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for continued recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 67%, reflecting the value of our software and public cloud portfolio. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 67% in Q3. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 52%, while our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. As we highlighted last quarter, we expect Public Cloud gross margins to continue to trend towards our long-term goal of 75% to 80% as an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business will be built on software solutions. The introduction of FSx for ONTAP with AWS and the addition of CloudCheckr to the Spot portfolio, both of which are software offerings, support our long-term margin goal. Q3 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model with operating margin of 25%, an all-time company high. EPS of $1.44 was up 31% year-over-year and also represented a new quarterly record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $260 million, and free cash flow was $199 million. During Q3, we repurchased $125 million in stock and paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $236 million to shareholders, representing 119% of free cash flow. We closed Q3 with $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. As many companies have highlighted during this earnings season, the dynamic supply chain situation continues to cause disruptions across the technology ecosystem. These headwinds were further exacerbated by Omicron. In addition to a worsening freight and expedite environment, we also experienced component supplier decommits beginning in the second half of Q3, which required us to purchase components in the open market at significant premiums. We were faced with the short-term decision of supporting the robust customer demand versus optimizing near-term product margin. NetApp has consistently focused on being a great long-term strategic partner to our loyal customer base, especially throughout the last two years of COVID. Consistent with this philosophy, we made this strategic decision to prioritize meeting customer demand with the trade-off being lower product margins in the short term. To be clear, the pricing and availability of our core HDD and SSD components are stable and are not a contributor to the near-term headwinds. With these supply chain headwinds as a backdrop, I want to highlight two critical takeaways. Number one, we believe these cost headwinds are temporary in nature; and number two, we expect that Q4 will be the trough for product margins. As you all know, \u2013 the timing of getting completely through these supply chain challenges remain fluid, but we do expect cost improvements in the coming quarters as the supply headwinds begin to ease throughout the first half of fiscal 2023. We also expect our recent price increases to help further stabilize product margins in the coming quarters. As the supply base for components and airline cargo normalize, we are confident that product margin will return to its structural level in the mid-50s particularly as our mix continues to trend towards All-flash. We do anticipate these supply chain challenges to impact our product revenue and product gross margins in Q4, the supply chain headwinds, and our ongoing actions to mitigate them, have been factored into our Q4 and updated full year guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.635 billion and $1.735 billion which, at the midpoint, implies an 8% increase year-over-year. We anticipate consolidated gross margin in Q4 to be approximately 64%, the near-term margin headwind is being driven by an incremental $50 million to $60 million of premiums we expect to incur in open market component purchases. Consistent with our philosophy and culture, we actively prioritized being a great strategic partner to our loyal customers, many of which have been with us for over 25 years; and feel great about the discipline and execution the NetApp team has displayed in managing through the current supply situation. We expect operating margin to be approximately 22% in Q4, which would have been closer to 25% without the recent supplier decommits. Assumed in this guidance are Q4 operating expenses of $705 million to $715 million, driven by continued investment in revenue generating activities, including expanding our Public Cloud portfolio, and investments in both our Cloud and customer success sales teams. We anticipate earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.21 and $1.31 per share. Assumed in our Q4 guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $15 million and our tax-rate will be approximately 18%. Our Q4 guidance implies revenue growth of approximately 10% year-over-year for fiscal 2022. We also have growing confidence in our expanding Public Cloud opportunity, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper and broader cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. As a result, we are raising the guidance on our Public Cloud ARR, with a new range of $525 million to $545 million exiting fiscal 2022. Please note that Fylamynt is a tech and talent acquisition and will not contribute any ARR in Q4. The implied forecast for total gross margin is approximately 67% for the full year. Our disciplined management of the business, despite the backdrop of supply cost headwinds, has allowed us to reaffirm our full year operating margin guidance of 23% to 24%. We are raising our fiscal 2022 EPS guidance. We now expect EPS to range between $5.07 and $5.17 representing 26% year-over-year growth, at the mid-point. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in delivering strong Q3 results. We will continue to be disciplined and long-term minded as we manage through the temporary supply challenges to meet as much customer demand as possible. Given the current environment, George and I are incredibly proud that the team stayed focused on our strategic priorities and have collectively leaned into executing against the tremendous growth opportunity we see over the next three to five years. As George mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day on March 22 where we will further discuss the long-term growth potential and value drivers for our shareholders, customers and partners. I\u2019ll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks Mike. Let\u2019s open the call for questions. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. You may proceed with your question.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. First question for Mike, if I may. You spoke about how revenue is constrained by component shortages in your fiscal Q4. But I wanted to better understand how that may be impacting your deferred revenue growth, which it has moderated to 4% growth. And so I was hoping you could describe in a little bit more detail why that may have slowed? And how we should think about the trajectory on a go-forward basis?\nMike Berry: Sure. So hey, thanks for the question, Karl. So there\u2019s two parts of that. So the first thing is when revenue is constrained and we\u2019re not able to ship or invoice, it does not go into deferred revenue. So it does not go on the balance sheet until it\u2019s actually invoiced. So if we\u2019re not able to ship, it does not go on the balance sheet. On deferred revenue, this is a super important question; I\u2019m going to tie it also to support revenue. When you look at the year-over-year growth for the last seven quarters of total deferred revenue and total support revenue, that has averaged somewhere between, call it, 4% to 6% when you take into account the impact of FX. So to be more specific, in Q3 and Q4 of last year, Q1 of this year, we had a benefit of FX of 2 to 3 percentage points. This quarter is actually a headwind of 1 percentage point. So when you normalize deferred revenue and support revenue, and those two are going to go almost hand in hand for the FX impact, you\u2019re going to get between 4%, 5% or 6% on an annual basis for all of those. So hopefully, that answers the question. Again, if we don\u2019t ship it doesn\u2019t go into deferred and then deferred and support also have been impacted by FX and they would largely move together. Thanks for the question.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you. I\u2019ll hop back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Just on the supply chain impact, I wondered if you could give any sense of type of product that was impacted more. And maybe just a split between what is \u2013 kind of what you would call freight versus underlying inputs kind of difference in the headwind that you\u2019re seeing? And whether it\u2019s kind of giving you more visibility as you look into kind of the next fiscal year, whether you\u2019re seeing kind of order activity pick up as customers try to assure availability? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: First of all, with regard to the large items in our bill of materials, meaning processors, DRAM, hard drive, solid-state storage, we have a very well-managed supply chain and have seen continued support from our leading suppliers. Most of our storage media are multi-sourced as you would expect. And we have had really good engagement from them. I think the places where we have seen supply decommits have been mostly in analog semiconductors. These are low volume \u2013 low value components that are used across a lot of our product families for things like voltage stabilization and other kinds of analog functions in those systems. So they are broad-based across our systems portfolio, and which is why we\u2019ve had to resort to, in some cases, open market purchases to offset constrained supply or supplier decommits that we saw in the middle of Q3. With regard to the logistics, as you all know, cargo airfreight has been the major source of distribution of both parts and finished products, and airfreight was impacted by Omicron. We\u2019re hopeful that we can see a steady recovery as we head into fiscal year 2023 of both parts availability and logistics constraints. And I can certainly share with you the multistep action plan that we have taken that includes engineering programs, that includes strong supplier engagement, that includes pricing uplifts and discount management as well as close customer engagement to get us through this process.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. You may proceed with your question.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thank you. Mike, I got two questions. First one is for Mike. You talked about April to mark the trough in operating margin. Does that mean despite seasonal trend into Q1, July quarter, the mix will help you and we should see a margin expansion? And then on \u2013 just a quick follow-up on all-flash array, how should I think about the mix of all-flash array between on-prem or enterprise customers versus the cloud? And I\u2019m assuming that the cloud would be considered new type of customers for your all-flash array. Thank you.\nMike Berry: So, hey, Mehdi, it\u2019s Mike. So if \u2013 I just want to replay back your question. And is your question, the lower operating margin in Q4, which was driven almost entirely by the premiums. And what was the question on the mix going into the July quarter?\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. I\u2019m assuming that July would follow some sort of a seasonal trend revenues down, but you would benefit from the mix so that your operating margins would rebound despite lower revenues.\nMike Berry: Yes. So we haven\u2019t guided fiscal 2023 yet. We\u2019ll talk about that on the next call. What we would tell you is that we wouldn\u2019t expect any change in our seasonality from Q4 to Q1. That\u2019s been relatively consistent. The one thing I\u2019d ask you to think about as well going into Q1, and both George and I talked about it, is the growth in cloud ARR is starting to have a much bigger impact positively on revenue growth as well as gross margins, which goes to up. And so that would be the one area I would ask you to consider as you do your models for next year. And again, we\u2019ll guide Q1 on the Q4 call. Go ahead, Mehdi.\nMehdi Hosseini: No, I was just going to repeat the question, diversification of all-flash array customers?\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. With regard to our customer footprint, we are winning with multiple elements of our portfolio. All-flash arrays continue to be well ahead of market growth rates, which is a clear indication that we are gaining share, and we are doing that by both winning new workloads in existing customers, as well as new customers. Our cloud portfolio, as I mentioned with an example on our call, gives us strength not only in net new to NetApp customers on the Public Cloud, but also an opportunity to displace their previous suppliers in their data centers as they harmonize their cloud environment with their data center environment and our CloudOps portfolio, Spot, Cloud Insights, CloudCheckr have been a source of great new customer additions.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. George, I was wondering about if you could talk about the confidence in Q4 margins being a trough. What times are you seeing that is making you think that specifically? And it appears that you\u2019re not baking in headwinds from NAND and HDDs and you called out good supplier relationships there. But it seems as though some of these are running into some issues as well. And if you could comment on if those had \u2013 if those start to become headwinds, is it right to understand that that\u2019s not contemplated to create incremental margin pressure? And I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: Okay. Let me take that in two parts. So let me first talk about the NAND, SSD market and then talk about the rest of the supply base, if that\u2019s all right? On the NAND side, we obviously have strong supplier relationships across the memory industry and are clearly multisource for all elements of our supply portfolio and SSDs. With regard to the recent incident impacting one of the members of that industry ecosystem, they, as you know, are not our leading supplier for SSDs. And so we feel good about the work that we\u2019ve done on our SSD base. There may be some increases in prices in SSDs, but our engineering and manufacturing team has done a super job, and we expect that for the go-forward, the total storage media cost will be flat year-on-year. So we feel good about that, offsetting certain elements of the supply base with other elements of the supply base. With regard to the broader \u2013 why do we believe product gross margins are a trough in Q4, listen, there\u2019s been a lot of work that we have undertaken to deal with the supply constraints? Clearly, we have most of the large volume items and the high dollar items in our supply base are well managed, and we do not see them impacted by the supply constraints that we have seen so far. There are certain elements of our supply base that we are dealing with, with decommits in the quarter that has required us to be in the open market. And we have engineering qualifications going on for all of the major elements to create alternate sources of supply or to engineer our way around those supply constraints. And some of those engineering solutions have reached the market and will come to market over the course of the first half of fiscal year 2023. The second \u2013 the third element is pricing and discount management. As you know, we have communicated previously that we did raise prices in the fall, and we have recently also communicated another impending price increase that takes effect this month. Those two price increases will have the primary impact later in Q4 and going through, for the most part, the benefit will be seen in fiscal year 2023. And those are all the mechanisms that cause us to feel confident that while we have been dealing with the constrained supply base, we have put in place a lot of controls to allow us to feel better about the path forward.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And if I could, Mike, just to go back on your seasonality from fiscal 4Q to fiscal 1Q comment, if I understood this right, you\u2019re taking actions in paying open market prices to mitigate the revenue impact. So are you able to \u2013 but you also noted that you do have some revenue impact in fiscal Q4 and you\u2019re \u2013 if we take George\u2019s comments here about sort of the supply chain normalization happening as you head into fiscal 2023, then why would we not see a better-than-normal seasonality in fiscal 1Q 2023 if fiscal 4Q is constrained? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Yes. So thanks for the question, Wamsi. So we do \u2013 going into Q1 after Q4, assuming Q4 plays out as we expect that really all depends on the availability of supply and specific supply. And mix matters here a lot. George talked about the components affecting a lot of the products across our portfolio. So as it sits today and as we look into Q1, we would expect to see some of that flow into fiscal 2023. When that\u2019s going to hit really depends on where we are from a supply chain perspective and specific components. And again, we\u2019ll update you on the Q4 call in terms of Q1. And certainly, the backdrop is to say we feel really good about the demand environment. Timing of those are really dependent on the supply chain situation, Wamsi.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you so much.\nMike Berry: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I have two as well, if I can. Just building on kind of Wamsi\u2019s question there. I guess the simple question for me is that you talk about the confidence in returning to a mid-50% product gross margin. Obviously, you\u2019re working through some things and you\u2019ve outlined kind of your expectations on storage media cost being flat. But with all of that said, do I think \u2013 should I think that gross margin on the product line returns to mid-50s in fiscal 2023? Is it second half of fiscal 2023? Any kind of framing of how you\u2019re thinking about the longevity of the pressures on that product gross margin would be helpful.\nMike Berry: Hey, Aaron, it\u2019s Mike. So thanks for the question. So this is super important. So just as a context, as you look at fiscal 2023, just a couple of things for you folks to think about. We really think we executed well on the things that we can control in Q3. And we\u2019ve raised guidance and revenue ARR and EPS, largely due to the great work of the team. And we have multiple new highs. We would expect to continue to execute well going into fiscal 2023. This is, as we sit today, we\u2019re not guiding Q3, but what we would say is, hey, let\u2019s do a replay of what we have said, and I think this will help you, which is product revenue has grown for four straight quarters. We expect that to continue into next year. We\u2019ve talked about the supply chain issues. We expect to moderate as we go through the first half of fiscal 2023. So, we would hope and expect that we would get back to that mid-50s during the second half of next year. And that\u2019s really driven by the three things George talked about, the improving supply chain situation, freight and expedite and the impact of the price increase. So as you look at next year, yes, we would expect to get back sometime in the second half of the year. Hopefully, that helps you with your modeling. Again, we\u2019re not giving guidance for Q3, just as we sit today. But hopefully, that helps a lot, Aaron.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. You talk about the Public Cloud business, and I know that you mentioned that Google, in particular, was ramping. Could you just give us maybe a bit more context of where we\u2019re at as far as the progression of maybe both Google and Amazon at this point? And when those \u2013 how we should think about those really kicking into that Public Cloud revenue?\nGeorge Kurian: I think we\u2019re pleased with all of our partnerships. Azure NetApp Files was a really strong performer this quarter as it has been for several quarters now, which demonstrates both our ability and knowledge of how to scale a hyperscaler relationship and the enormous strength and leverage that gives us once it\u2019s scaled. I would say the earliest of the three is Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. We announced it in September, and we are very, very pleased with the level of trials and early activity. They have frankly, surpassed our expectations, but it\u2019s early in the going. And so it takes time to translate those trials into paid customers and to expand the relationships across the FSx. So, I would say we\u2019re excited, but we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, and we know where, what that work is. And so you should expect, broadly speaking, I see FSx about 18 months behind where we saw AMS with Microsoft Azure. Google is in between. Google has \u2013 we have seen several big customer successes with Google, and we are working to expand the range of workloads and the range of use cases with them across the portfolio.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thanks for taking my question. I had a quick couple of questions on the Public Cloud as well and just following up on Aaron\u2019s question. I think this was one, if you can help me understand if I look at your ARR \u2013 Public Cloud ARR, you did have an increase of about $80 million or so, which looks to be an acceleration sequentially compared to how you\u2019ve done in recent quarters. How much of that is maybe attributable to CloudCheckr? And excluding that it does still look like an acceleration, so if you can get us \u2013 give us some more insight into how much of that is driven by some of the newer partnerships versus it does sound like more of the growth coming from partnerships that you initiated earlier, that would be great. And then I have a quick follow-up on Public Cloud ARR. That\u2019s good.\nMike Berry: Sure. So this is Mike. I\u2019ll take the first part. So we finished cloud ARR at $469 million, as you referenced 98% growth. In that number CloudCheckr represented about $35 million of ARR. So their core organic business, about $434 million, that was a year-over-year growth of about 83% versus 80% in Q2 and 89% in Q1. So really nice growth on the organic business. And as we called out, that was really driven by Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Insights and Spot.\nSamik Chatterjee: George, any \u2013 sorry, any color on what\u2019s driving the application here? How much of that is coming from the earlier partnerships with Azure versus the newer partnerships with AWS?\nGeorge Kurian: As Mike mentioned, the new partnerships are not material contributors yet. We are excited about the potential, but you should see that potential realized over the next few years. I think that in the past quarter, the vast majority of the acceleration comes from both new customer additions as well as when you see a really strong dollar-based net retention rate. It shows that once the customer uses one of these cloud portfolios, they expand their use quite substantially. So, I think that\u2019s where the vast majority of the progress has been.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve talked about your order growth rates. And I just wanted to see if you could maybe help us get a better understanding of how your customers are behaving, given that we had a sense that in IT space, many customers, given the lengthening of lead times and the supply chain constraints, are putting in orders earlier. I want to confirm if you're seeing that and what kind of order growth rates you're experiencing. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, we don't see any unusual behavior. We have close relationships with our customers. Clearly, we are monitoring, given the supply chain situation, a very, very tight inspection of our order backlog and our order pipeline. We see healthy broad-based demand but no sense of shadow demand or multiple purchases in our pipeline. So we feel good about the sort of the real demand in the business, and we're doing as much as we can to meet it. Demand, as Mike has said, is outpacing supply.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nRod Hall: Yeah, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to start off with the price increases. We've seen other people in this general category of products, increasing prices by around 10%. I wonder if you guys could maybe quantify the ballpark of those price increases. And maybe comment a little bit on the stickiness of that, too. There's a difference of opinion as to whether these are going to be around to stay and will people flex prices back down as underlying costs go back down as they do. So I just wanted a comment on that, if I could get it.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I won't give you a specific number. I'll just say your read of the industry and our participation in it is in the target range, right? So obviously, we monitor the behavior of the industry and the cost of our supply, and we take appropriate action. We've taken two actions as we mentioned earlier, one in the fall and the second one in February, and we should see the benefits of those play out over time. We have to give our customers the benefit of those orders that are already in flight. Our quotes that are in flight, you have to honor them to be a good partner to customers. But over the course of Q4 and certainly heading into the new fiscal year, you should see the benefits of that come into the business. With regard to the likely duration and so on, listen, we always trade off being a good partner to customers with the need to maintain margins in our business. It's too early for me to comment. We will continue to monitor the situation, and if we make changes, we will let you know.\nRod Hall: Okay. And then I had a quick follow-up and then it's on the Public Cloud Services, we were wondering, is all of that regionally accounted for in the Americas? Or do you spread it across the regions? And then I guess more generally, after you answer that one, just comment maybe on the strength of the Americas. What's driving that? It was pretty strong this quarter.\nMike Berry: Yes. So an answer to the first question is the large majority of the PCS business is generated in the Americas, to the extent that there is international business that flows through entities internationally, we would certainly report it that way. The strong results in the Americas, as you mentioned, they did have a very strong quarter. That's where we saw a lot of the strong order growth coming in. So the Americas had a good quarter, both in the Hybrid Cloud and the Public Cloud segments, Rod.\nRod Hall: Okay. Great, thanks Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may proceed with your question.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. Just first of all, just a clarification on some of the comments you made about the quarter just closed. Are you saying that unmet demand was entirely related to supply chain? Or was there also a further acceleration in orders? And then I had a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: Demand, as we said, demand is outpacing supply. We've been aggressive to meet demand wherever we could. And I'll just say, our team executed really well. I think that we'll just be transparent. Demand has outpaced supply both in Q3 and we expect in Q4.\nSteven Fox: Okay. That's helpful. And then, George, it seems like the M&A that you've done on the Public Cloud side is starting to have a compounding effect on your growth rates. Is there any way to sort of think about how that sort of changes the view for longer-term growth in Public Cloud, given that when you first set some of these targets, you didn't have some of the capabilities you have now? And sort of how that fact layers into growth going forward? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think, first of all, listen. We know we are clearly ahead of our $1 billion ARR target. We will communicate the long-term targets and our perspectives on the cloud business at our Investor Day, right? So I am really excited about the portfolio we've built. We started with cloud storage. We have natively integrated cloud storage with the world's leading cloud providers, and you are seeing the acceleration of that business. We also expanded our cloud portfolio with a strong position in cloud infrastructure management with Spot, Cloud Insights, CloudCheckr and now Fylamynt helping the entire portfolio get easily adopted by customers. And so I really do feel like we have built two strong beachheads in markets that are expanding to our overall TAM and are demonstrating the ability for us to get new customers and cross-sell and upsell them a lot of different things. So I'm really excited about our portfolio. We continue to be disciplined acquirers and manage shareholder returns, both with investing for the long-term growth of our business while returning a significant amount of free cash flow to shareholders.\nSteven Fox: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. You may proceed with your question.\nJason Ader: Yes. Thank you. So George, I understand that the supply is \u2013 sorry, the demand is outpacing the supply, but how would you characterize the demand environment right now versus, say, the last few quarters, especially for your hybrid solutions in light of what some people have talked about with some pent-up demand impact in 2021? And then just as a quick follow-up, I know you guys are not guiding for FY 2023 revenue. But Mike, any early thoughts on kind of puts and takes in terms of helping us thinking about the model for revenue in 2023?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think we continue to see steady broad-based demand, right? It's very solid. It's across a lot of different industries, a lot of different verticals, and they are for use cases that are headline news in the industry, digital transformation, cloud enablement, unstructured data analytics, artificial intelligence, ransomware protection. I mean these are all well-known use cases with broad secular demand. I did not believe that there was a V-shaped recovery, to be honest. I think IT departments are mature buying centers, and they buy steadily over time. I think the year-on-year compares in some cases, were exacerbated by the fact that during COVID, you saw the opposite pattern for many companies. We had a good business pattern even during COVID. So I continue to remain optimistic. Our team has executed excellently. We have gained share in every category that we have played in, and our Hybrid Cloud business has two strong growth engines in object storage and all-flash.\nMike Berry: Hey, Jason, on your question \u2013 I'm sorry, did you want to add something?\nJason Ader: No, go for it. Yes, go for it.\nMike Berry: Okay. Great. So I'll go back over what basically Aaron's question, so we're exiting \u2013 when you look at the different revenue components, four straight quarters of growth in product. We've guided for the fifth in Q4, and we expect that to continue in 2023. On a year-to-date basis, product is up about 11%. Support, we've talked about when you normalize for FX, hey, the last seven quarters, it's been a 4%, 5%, 6% grower. And again, look hard at deferred revenue, especially short-term deferred because more than 90% of support revenue in a quarter comes off the balance sheet. The cloud ARR, again, we'll update you in March, but you can do your own forecast there. As I talked about in my script, cloud contributed four of the 10 percentage points of growth in the quarter. So it's really starting to have a meaningful impact. And then, hey, nice results in professional services, but it's pretty small. So those would be the puts and takes going into next year. The one thing to keep in mind is that's largely organic. We'll continue to obviously be disciplined acquirers, but we do look to expand our cloud portfolio next year as well.\nJason Ader: Thanks very much. Good luck.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. You may proceed with your question.\nNik Todorov: Yes. Thanks and good afternoon everyone. A question regarding \u2013 given all of the constraints and the price increases you guys talked about, are you seeing any changes in customer behavior in relation to whether they prefer hardware versus cloud solution? Or do you see any increase in appetite from fully managed solutions like your cloud services or maybe Keystone?\nGeorge Kurian: We feel good about the ability to serve customers in all of the ways that you talked about, absolutely on target. I think we've seen \u2013 while we haven't seen any sort of radical shift in behavior, the long-term trends around cloud and the use of as a service model is broadly defined, continue to be playing out for us. Our cloud portfolio continues to be really, really strong and we are able to help customers deploy workloads very quickly on public cloud environments, if they aren't able to build and deploy an environment in their data center. Keystone also had a good quarter. It's early in the going, but we continue to see more and more vertical industry wins, more and more new customer wins and also wins across our geographic base, just like you would expect us to be focused on when managing an early business. So I feel good about both parts of the business. And then, of course, our differentiated product portfolio, as we said, we're focused on growing all-flash and object storage. We have the best operating system in the market for hybrid flash that had a good quarter. So good execution across the board.\nNik Todorov: Got it. Thanks guys. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your may proceed with your question.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Just two for me. You guided $705 million to $716 million, I think it was for OpEx last quarter and came in about $683 million. I'm just curious how you're thinking about OpEx and your ability to sort of toggle it if gross margin remains under pressure? And then if you can just talk a bit about Asia since it was about 12% of revenue, which seems low. Was there anything specific to pressure that? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Sure. So Shannon, its Mike here. On OpEx, yes, we did come in a little bit below guidance. That was really driven by timing of program spend. And quite frankly, we had baked in being able to hire more folks than we were able to. So that were \u2013 those were the two big drivers. From Q3 to Q4, we've talked about it, hey; we want to make sure that we're investing in the areas that drive growth. So the increase is driven by cloud, both in sales and in product. There is some program spend that we didn't spend in Q3 that will flow into Q4. And then there's always timing around things like commissions, so that's Q4. And it's a great question on toggling OpEx. I mean, again, our view is this is temporary. It's going to work its way through to 2023. Therefore, we don't want to do anything that hamstrings the growth in the business. If something changes during 2023, we'll certainly take a look at it, but that's not our stance today. The Asia revenue drop that you saw is really driven by two things, largely supply chain and us not being able to deliver. So that was mostly supply chain related versus we were able to deliver more in the other geos, which is why you saw that year-over-year drop in revenue.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may proceed with your question.\nJim Suva: Thank you. I just have one question. It's probably for George or maybe Mike. But you've been very ethical, loyal and true to your customers who placed orders and agreed to the terms and contracts and commitments. When you hear these decommitments, what's the action or reaction to NetApp then strategically? Do you find alternative providers long-term? Or do the host who contracted with you who broke their promises come back and give you some concessions down the road? Or do you just kind of diverse or break the bridge and move on without them? I'm just kind of curious because you've taken the high road. And it seems like some of your suppliers have really put you in an awkward situation?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think these are all the conversations that we have with our supply base. We have good long-term suppliers that support the vast majority of our bond and that we manage directly. There are other components that are integrated into subassemblies in our overall systems that sometimes are \u2013 have been a part of the challenge here. There's sort of multiple discussions there, right? I think clearly, we want to understand the reasons for such a decommit. We want to understand where we are in sort of the ability for the customer \u2013 for the supplier to meet our demand profile. And then there are ways that we have worked really hard in engineering to continue to build diversity of supply across our entire bill of materials and in the cases where we don't feel like we can rely on a supplier to give us access to other suppliers. And so you'll see us continuing to work that over the next several quarters to make sure that we have all the levers at our disposal to meet demand.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Thank you so much, George.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. You may proceed with your question.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes. Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Yes, just a quick one for me. George, how would you describe in hybrid environments where your sweet spot is today for object storage and all-flash arrays? And do you think that changes over time as you add to the portfolio?\nGeorge Kurian: I mean all-flash arrays clearly, we are the strongest vendor in the mid-range systems and mid-range is displacing traditional high-end systems. So we are in more and more and more customers winning the really high end of the market as well. So really strong broad-based distribution of our portfolio. Our hybrid flash systems have done really well in the entry market. If you look at the entry price bands growth rates, those are much more hybrid flash businesses than all-flash business. And so the combination of those two give us the ability to cover a broad range of use cases with the right form factor. With regard to object storage, it's another extension of our unstructured data portfolio. The unstructured data started out in files for the most part and increasingly, as the scale of those repositories have grown, customers are starting to use object technology to allow for management and ease of administration. Our solutions have been really, really strong. I think we're focused on that market. We have a really good cost-effective, highly scalable, centrally managed object support solution. And even in the object world, we have unique integrations with the Public Cloud that allows us to build a truly hybrid object environment, combining some parts of the environment being in customers' data centers and some parts being in true public cloud under one policy framework.\nAnanda Baruah: That\u2019s super. Helpful. Appreciated. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may proceed with your question.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for squeezing me and I apologize if this has been asked already. The first one I had was on the cloud ARR side. I think you talked about the gross margins being 71% better than corporate averages. Is there a way to think about at what point do we cross and start to see operating margins in that business that are in line to corporate averages potentially?\nMike Berry: Yes. So Amit, this is Mike. So we go down in the segment reporting the gross margin. At this point, we don't have any plans to go down to operating margin. We'll continue to look at that, but we're going to report segment reporting revenue down to gross margin.\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. And then you're on these component issues that I think you and everyone has been going through these challenges now. As I think about maybe the April quarter headwinds, right, and you've talked about the gross margin issues, is there a way to think about how much of that is freight logistics versus component issues? And then is there any revenue you left on the table in April that you would call out or quantify for us?\nMike Berry: So the majority of the headwinds are from components versus freight. Freight and logistics are there, but the components are a bigger piece of that. And then we won't quantify what that was from a revenue perspective, what we'd say is that's all baked into the Q4 and full year guidance that we gave.\nAmit Daryanani: I guess Mike the part as we get \u2013 we should have conviction that we could pick up what the revenue was left on the table in the July quarter as you are requalifying some of these products and these bottlenecks alleviate, right?\nMike Berry: Yes. So there was a previous question on that. What we'd say is to the extent that we have supply available and we're able to deliver those, then they could flow into Q1. We're not guiding Q1 yet. We'll do that at the end of Q4. But that is almost entirely dependent on the supply chain situation. And mix matters here, it's super important in terms of what is the mix and what are the components.\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. Thank you very much.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa. You may proceed with your question.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay. So I've got four demand questions and two OpEx ones. So \u2013 but joking aside, when you look at what happened in calendar 2018 with a big hardware refresh cycle, I know you talked multiple times demand is outpacing supply. But just curious because some of my CIOs checks suggest that there is a replacement cycle coming on, maybe more in the back half of this year. And then on top of that, some of my CIO checks also suggests that with some IT workers getting back to the office or just people getting back to the office, that's also some of the growth drivers. So I know you did talk about a couple before, George, but maybe if you could extrapolate if some of these are also contributing to hopefully a good demand year for you all this calendar year.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. Listen, I think you hit the points quite accurately. I think we see the improvements in the overall sort of return to work and the impact from omicron, sort of easing through the course of the year, all things remaining the same. And we think that demand continues to be really solid, steady and broad based. And so we're excited about the year ahead. We're certainly not guiding next fiscal. We'll guide when we guide it. But as I said in my remarks, we feel very, very good about the demand picture, and we're working hard to meet it with as much supply as we can get.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay, thanks. Good luck on the New Year.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you. As we wrap up, I want to leave you with three callouts, the sizable and enduring trends of cloud and data-driven digital transformation, where we at NetApp play a critical role in helping customers achieve their goals are driving broad-based customer demand for our products and services. Our embracive cloud has expanded our addressable market. The real opportunity is still in front of us. And thanks to our strong Public Cloud Services performance, we are well ahead of our plan to achieve $1 billion in ARR in fiscal year 2025. Our focused execution and effective management of temporary supply chain headwind enable us to capture our expanding opportunity and deliver operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins. Thank you and I hope to see you at our Investor Day next month, where we will talk more about our long-term growth and value drivers.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion. Number one, Q3 was another strong quarter, with all-time company highs in gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS as our business model continues to show significant operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins. Number two, our cloud business had another outstanding quarter. We clearly are solidly ahead of our original plan to hit our $1 billion ARR target in fiscal 2025. Number three, we are prioritizing meeting as much customer demand as possible as we navigate near-term component shortages and expect revenue to continue to be constrained in Q4. And number four, we are increasing our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and Public Cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q3 and a very healthy demand backdrop for Q4. Now to the details. In fiscal Q3, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and operating leverage across the entire business. Outstanding execution by the NetApp team yielded Q3 billings of $1.76 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.61 billion, also up 10% year-over-year. Our solid Q3 results were driven by continued strong demand across both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.5 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue into Q4 and throughout fiscal 2023. Product revenue of $846 million increased 9% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we've seen over the last two quarters, software product revenue of $507 million increased 18% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Total Q3 recurring support revenue of $586 million increased 3% year-over-year. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue run rate, which includes both product and support revenue, eclipsed $3.2 billion for the first time in the company's history, and was up 23% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited Q3 at $469 million, up 98% strong growth in Azure NetApp Files, Spot and Cloud Insights, with CloudCheckr contributing $35 million in ARR. Organic public cloud ARR, excluding $434 million in Q3, up 83% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $110 million, up 100% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. The growing scale of our Public Cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering four of the 10 points in revenue growth. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $696 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. When combined, software product revenue, recurring support and Public Cloud revenue totaled $1.2 billion, another company high and increased 14% year-over-year, representing 75% of total revenue, up from 72% in Q3 2021. We ended Q3 with $4 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Q3 marks the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for continued recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 67%, reflecting the value of our software and public cloud portfolio. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 67% in Q3. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 52%, while our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. As we highlighted last quarter, we expect Public Cloud gross margins to continue to trend towards our long-term goal of 75% to 80% as an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business will be built on software solutions. The introduction of FSx for ONTAP with AWS and the addition of CloudCheckr to the Spot portfolio, both of which are software offerings, support our long-term margin goal. Q3 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model with operating margin of 25%, an all-time company high. EPS of $1.44 was up 31% year-over-year and also represented a new quarterly record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $260 million, and free cash flow was $199 million. During Q3, we repurchased $125 million in stock and paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $236 million to shareholders, representing 119% of free cash flow. We closed Q3 with $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. As many companies have highlighted during this earnings season, the dynamic supply chain situation continues to cause disruptions across the technology ecosystem. These headwinds were further exacerbated by Omicron. In addition to a worsening freight and expedite environment, we also experienced component supplier decommits beginning in the second half of Q3, which required us to purchase components in the open market at significant premiums. We were faced with the short-term decision of supporting the robust customer demand versus optimizing near-term product margin. NetApp has consistently focused on being a great long-term strategic partner to our loyal customer base, especially throughout the last two years of COVID. Consistent with this philosophy, we made this strategic decision to prioritize meeting customer demand with the trade-off being lower product margins in the short term. To be clear, the pricing and availability of our core HDD and SSD components are stable and are not a contributor to the near-term headwinds. With these supply chain headwinds as a backdrop, I want to highlight two critical takeaways. Number one, we believe these cost headwinds are temporary in nature; and number two, we expect that Q4 will be the trough for product margins. As you all know, \u2013 the timing of getting completely through these supply chain challenges remain fluid, but we do expect cost improvements in the coming quarters as the supply headwinds begin to ease throughout the first half of fiscal 2023. We also expect our recent price increases to help further stabilize product margins in the coming quarters. As the supply base for components and airline cargo normalize, we are confident that product margin will return to its structural level in the mid-50s particularly as our mix continues to trend towards All-flash. We do anticipate these supply chain challenges to impact our product revenue and product gross margins in Q4, the supply chain headwinds, and our ongoing actions to mitigate them, have been factored into our Q4 and updated full year guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.635 billion and $1.735 billion which, at the midpoint, implies an 8% increase year-over-year. We anticipate consolidated gross margin in Q4 to be approximately 64%, the near-term margin headwind is being driven by an incremental $50 million to $60 million of premiums we expect to incur in open market component purchases. Consistent with our philosophy and culture, we actively prioritized being a great strategic partner to our loyal customers, many of which have been with us for over 25 years; and feel great about the discipline and execution the NetApp team has displayed in managing through the current supply situation. We expect operating margin to be approximately 22% in Q4, which would have been closer to 25% without the recent supplier decommits. Assumed in this guidance are Q4 operating expenses of $705 million to $715 million, driven by continued investment in revenue generating activities, including expanding our Public Cloud portfolio, and investments in both our Cloud and customer success sales teams. We anticipate earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.21 and $1.31 per share. Assumed in our Q4 guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $15 million and our tax-rate will be approximately 18%. Our Q4 guidance implies revenue growth of approximately 10% year-over-year for fiscal 2022. We also have growing confidence in our expanding Public Cloud opportunity, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper and broader cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. As a result, we are raising the guidance on our Public Cloud ARR, with a new range of $525 million to $545 million exiting fiscal 2022. Please note that Fylamynt is a tech and talent acquisition and will not contribute any ARR in Q4. The implied forecast for total gross margin is approximately 67% for the full year. Our disciplined management of the business, despite the backdrop of supply cost headwinds, has allowed us to reaffirm our full year operating margin guidance of 23% to 24%. We are raising our fiscal 2022 EPS guidance. We now expect EPS to range between $5.07 and $5.17 representing 26% year-over-year growth, at the mid-point. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in delivering strong Q3 results. We will continue to be disciplined and long-term minded as we manage through the temporary supply challenges to meet as much customer demand as possible. Given the current environment, George and I are incredibly proud that the team stayed focused on our strategic priorities and have collectively leaned into executing against the tremendous growth opportunity we see over the next three to five years. As George mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day on March 22 where we will further discuss the long-term growth potential and value drivers for our shareholders, customers and partners. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Sure. So hey, thanks for the question, Karl. So there's two parts of that. So the first thing is when revenue is constrained and we're not able to ship or invoice, it does not go into deferred revenue. So it does not go on the balance sheet until it's actually invoiced. So if we're not able to ship, it does not go on the balance sheet. On deferred revenue, this is a super important question; I'm going to tie it also to support revenue. When you look at the year-over-year growth for the last seven quarters of total deferred revenue and total support revenue, that has averaged somewhere between, call it, 4% to 6% when you take into account the impact of FX. So to be more specific, in Q3 and Q4 of last year, Q1 of this year, we had a benefit of FX of 2 to 3 percentage points. This quarter is actually a headwind of 1 percentage point. So when you normalize deferred revenue and support revenue, and those two are going to go almost hand in hand for the FX impact, you're going to get between 4%, 5% or 6% on an annual basis for all of those. So hopefully, that answers the question. Again, if we don't ship it doesn't go into deferred and then deferred and support also have been impacted by FX and they would largely move together. Thanks for the question. So, hey, Mehdi, it's Mike. So if \u2013 I just want to replay back your question. And is your question, the lower operating margin in Q4, which was driven almost entirely by the premiums. And what was the question on the mix going into the July quarter? Yes. So we haven't guided fiscal 2023 yet. We'll talk about that on the next call. What we would tell you is that we wouldn't expect any change in our seasonality from Q4 to Q1. That's been relatively consistent. The one thing I'd ask you to think about as well going into Q1, and both George and I talked about it, is the growth in cloud ARR is starting to have a much bigger impact positively on revenue growth as well as gross margins, which goes to up. And so that would be the one area I would ask you to consider as you do your models for next year. And again, we'll guide Q1 on the Q4 call. Go ahead, Mehdi. Yes. So thanks for the question, Wamsi. So we do \u2013 going into Q1 after Q4, assuming Q4 plays out as we expect that really all depends on the availability of supply and specific supply. And mix matters here a lot. George talked about the components affecting a lot of the products across our portfolio. So as it sits today and as we look into Q1, we would expect to see some of that flow into fiscal 2023. When that's going to hit really depends on where we are from a supply chain perspective and specific components. And again, we'll update you on the Q4 call in terms of Q1. And certainly, the backdrop is to say we feel really good about the demand environment. Timing of those are really dependent on the supply chain situation, Wamsi. You bet. Hey, Aaron, it's Mike. So thanks for the question. So this is super important. So just as a context, as you look at fiscal 2023, just a couple of things for you folks to think about. We really think we executed well on the things that we can control in Q3. And we've raised guidance and revenue ARR and EPS, largely due to the great work of the team. And we have multiple new highs. We would expect to continue to execute well going into fiscal 2023. This is, as we sit today, we're not guiding Q3, but what we would say is, hey, let's do a replay of what we have said, and I think this will help you, which is product revenue has grown for four straight quarters. We expect that to continue into next year. We've talked about the supply chain issues. We expect to moderate as we go through the first half of fiscal 2023. So, we would hope and expect that we would get back to that mid-50s during the second half of next year. And that's really driven by the three things George talked about, the improving supply chain situation, freight and expedite and the impact of the price increase. So as you look at next year, yes, we would expect to get back sometime in the second half of the year. Hopefully, that helps you with your modeling. Again, we're not giving guidance for Q3, just as we sit today. But hopefully, that helps a lot, Aaron. Sure. So this is Mike. I'll take the first part. So we finished cloud ARR at $469 million, as you referenced 98% growth. In that number CloudCheckr represented about $35 million of ARR. So their core organic business, about $434 million, that was a year-over-year growth of about 83% versus 80% in Q2 and 89% in Q1. So really nice growth on the organic business. And as we called out, that was really driven by Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Insights and Spot. Yes. So an answer to the first question is the large majority of the PCS business is generated in the Americas, to the extent that there is international business that flows through entities internationally, we would certainly report it that way. The strong results in the Americas, as you mentioned, they did have a very strong quarter. That's where we saw a lot of the strong order growth coming in. So the Americas had a good quarter, both in the Hybrid Cloud and the Public Cloud segments, Rod. Thank you. Hey, Jason, on your question \u2013 I'm sorry, did you want to add something? Okay. Great. So I'll go back over what basically Aaron's question, so we're exiting \u2013 when you look at the different revenue components, four straight quarters of growth in product. We've guided for the fifth in Q4, and we expect that to continue in 2023. On a year-to-date basis, product is up about 11%. Support, we've talked about when you normalize for FX, hey, the last seven quarters, it's been a 4%, 5%, 6% grower. And again, look hard at deferred revenue, especially short-term deferred because more than 90% of support revenue in a quarter comes off the balance sheet. The cloud ARR, again, we'll update you in March, but you can do your own forecast there. As I talked about in my script, cloud contributed four of the 10 percentage points of growth in the quarter. So it's really starting to have a meaningful impact. And then, hey, nice results in professional services, but it's pretty small. So those would be the puts and takes going into next year. The one thing to keep in mind is that's largely organic. We'll continue to obviously be disciplined acquirers, but we do look to expand our cloud portfolio next year as well. Sure. So Shannon, its Mike here. On OpEx, yes, we did come in a little bit below guidance. That was really driven by timing of program spend. And quite frankly, we had baked in being able to hire more folks than we were able to. So that were \u2013 those were the two big drivers. From Q3 to Q4, we've talked about it, hey; we want to make sure that we're investing in the areas that drive growth. So the increase is driven by cloud, both in sales and in product. There is some program spend that we didn't spend in Q3 that will flow into Q4. And then there's always timing around things like commissions, so that's Q4. And it's a great question on toggling OpEx. I mean, again, our view is this is temporary. It's going to work its way through to 2023. Therefore, we don't want to do anything that hamstrings the growth in the business. If something changes during 2023, we'll certainly take a look at it, but that's not our stance today. The Asia revenue drop that you saw is really driven by two things, largely supply chain and us not being able to deliver. So that was mostly supply chain related versus we were able to deliver more in the other geos, which is why you saw that year-over-year drop in revenue. Thank you. Yes. So Amit, this is Mike. So we go down in the segment reporting the gross margin. At this point, we don't have any plans to go down to operating margin. We'll continue to look at that, but we're going to report segment reporting revenue down to gross margin. So the majority of the headwinds are from components versus freight. Freight and logistics are there, but the components are a bigger piece of that. And then we won't quantify what that was from a revenue perspective, what we'd say is that's all baked into the Q4 and full year guidance that we gave. Yes. So there was a previous question on that. What we'd say is to the extent that we have supply available and we're able to deliver those, then they could flow into Q1. We're not guiding Q1 yet. We'll do that at the end of Q4. But that is almost entirely dependent on the supply chain situation. And mix matters here, it's super important in terms of what is the mix and what are the components. Thank you."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to our Q3 FY 2022 earnings call. We delivered another outstanding quarter, building on the momentum we've had in recent periods. Demand for our solutions is strong and powered by the alignment of our differentiated technology portfolio with customer priorities. In Q3, our focused execution delivered: double-digit revenue growth, led by the impressive performance of our Public Cloud Services and All-flash array businesses; record high gross margin dollars, operating income, and earnings per share. NetApp plays a critical role in helping customers achieve their business and cloud transformation goals. I am pleased that our differentiation here continues to receive third-party validation by industry leaders, independent analysts, and existing and new customers. We were recognized by Amazon Web Services for our achievements as an AWS partner. NetApp was named the 2021 AWS Independent Software Vendor Design Partner of the Year \u2013 U.S., for the jointly engineered and natively integrated Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP service. Additionally, GigaOm called out NetApp as the only vendor with a multi-cloud strategy and execution that translates to a continuous data management plane across clouds and locations, a comprehensive enterprise-grade feature set, and flexible deployment options. We were listed as a leader in three GigaOm Radar reports: Cloud File Systems, Primary Storage for Large Enterprises, and Enterprise Scale-Out File Systems. Not only are we a leader in each category, we are the only vendor to lead in all three. This recognition spotlights the value we bring to our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys. Customers are also endorsing our value, creating strong demand for solutions in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment was driven by continued strength in object storage and All-flash arrays. Our All-flash array business hit another milestone in Q3, with a record high annualized run rate of $3.2 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year. All-flash array penetration of our installed base ticked up another point to 31% of installed base systems, giving us substantial headroom to continue to help existing and new customers modernize their storage environments with cloud-connected flash arrays. We further enhanced our position with the introduction of the AFF A900, which delivers unified support for file, block, and object protocols, built-in data protection with cutting-edge anti-ransomware capabilities, and the high performance and resiliency required to support the most critical business workloads. Public Cloud ARR grew to $469 million, an increase of 98% year-over-year, including the benefit from the CloudCheckr acquisition which closed early in Q3. Public Cloud dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains healthy at 169%, as customers increase their usage of our public cloud services and adopt new products. The expanded market reach from our cloud partners and the broadening participation of our field sales organization has delivered outstanding performance in our Public Cloud segment this year, which puts us well ahead of our plan to achieve $1 billion in ARR in fiscal year 2025. We, uniquely, have fully integrated services with all the major public cloud providers. I am pleased with the level of engagement from our cloud partners and with the performance of our Cloud Storage services. Azure NetApp Files again grew ahead of plan; Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud is ramping nicely; and, while still very early days, we are seeing lots of proofs of concept and activity with AWS FSx for NetApp ONTAP. Our differentiated CloudOps portfolio for multi-cloud infrastructure management is also growing well, led by Spot and Cloud Insights. It is expanding our addressable market, and opening opportunities with new buyers at existing customers and with new customers as we help them reduce the cost and complexity of managing their rapidly growing cloud environments. We are delivering innovation at cloud speed and enhancing our solutions to address the needs of cloud natives and born-in-the-cloud applications. We've made Cloud Backup Kubernetes aware and broaden Spot Ocean with automated cloud infrastructure and application management for Apache Spark and Ocean CD, enabling faster deployment of Kubernetes applications with end-to-end visibility and management. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the CloudCheckr acquisition early in Q3. CloudCheckr complements the FinOps capabilities of Spot with the multi-cloud reports, analytics and governance needed to plan, manage and optimize cloud costs to ensure organizations get the most out of their cloud investment. We continue the rapid pace of organic and inorganic innovation with today's announcement of the acquisition of Fylamynt. Fylamynt extends our leadership in cloud operations. Adding Fylamynt's cloud automation technology to the Spot platform will make it easy for customers to integrate Spot solutions with their existing tools, processes and infrastructure code. This will accelerate their ability to take advantage of Spot's suite of capabilities for understanding and optimizing their cloud infrastructure. I'm excited to welcome the Fylamynt team to NetApp. As I've said many times, our strategy to help customers deal with the challenges of managing data and applications in hybrid multi-cloud environments is helping us expand our business by winning new customers and displacing the competition. A global third-party logistics company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to host data migrated from Nutanix systems in its data centers. They chose NetApp-based cloud services for our resiliency, cost efficiency and multi-protocol support. This win marks a new logo for us and has already created additional opportunity for Cloud Manager and Cloud Insights. Another new customer win came from a multinational energy infrastructure company, who chose Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure to migrate workloads away from on-premises Dell systems. They are now considering replacing expired Dell systems with on-premises NetApp systems to make it easier to move data across environments in the future. We had a first-time win at an international government agency with Spot Eco to optimize its multimillion-dollar cloud spend. This win becomes a lighthouse reference account for us which we can leverage to reach into other related agencies. In summary, our strong Q3 results underscore our unique position in solving organization's most significant challenges in both cloud-native and traditional applications, on-premises and in hybrid multi-cloud environments. First, we help customers simplify and modernize existing data centers and deploy traditional applications quickly and confidently. Second, we help customers adopt modern application architectures like Kubernetes and microservices for new workloads and deploy data-rich applications like machine and deep learning. And third, we help customers optimize cost, performance, availability and security for applications and associated infrastructure across multiple clouds. The complexities created by rapid data growth, multi-cloud management and the adoption of next-gen technologies creates a sizable opportunity for us with focused execution, I am confident in our ability to capture that opportunity and deliver continued growth. We're holding an Investor Day on March 22, where we'll talk more about our growth opportunity and our plans to drive shareholder value. You can register at investors.netapp.com. If you have any questions, please reach out to the IR team. Before I turn the call over to Mike to walk you through the numbers, I want to take a moment to welcome Harv Bhela to NetApp as our Chief Product Officer. Harv brings with him more than 25 years of experience building industry-defining software categories and cloud services. I also want to thank Brad Anderson for his leadership and wish him well in his retirement. With that, I'll hand it over to Mike. First of all, with regard to the large items in our bill of materials, meaning processors, DRAM, hard drive, solid-state storage, we have a very well-managed supply chain and have seen continued support from our leading suppliers. Most of our storage media are multi-sourced as you would expect. And we have had really good engagement from them. I think the places where we have seen supply decommits have been mostly in analog semiconductors. These are low volume \u2013 low value components that are used across a lot of our product families for things like voltage stabilization and other kinds of analog functions in those systems. So they are broad-based across our systems portfolio, and which is why we've had to resort to, in some cases, open market purchases to offset constrained supply or supplier decommits that we saw in the middle of Q3. With regard to the logistics, as you all know, cargo airfreight has been the major source of distribution of both parts and finished products, and airfreight was impacted by Omicron. We're hopeful that we can see a steady recovery as we head into fiscal year 2023 of both parts availability and logistics constraints. And I can certainly share with you the multistep action plan that we have taken that includes engineering programs, that includes strong supplier engagement, that includes pricing uplifts and discount management as well as close customer engagement to get us through this process. Yes. With regard to our customer footprint, we are winning with multiple elements of our portfolio. All-flash arrays continue to be well ahead of market growth rates, which is a clear indication that we are gaining share, and we are doing that by both winning new workloads in existing customers, as well as new customers. Our cloud portfolio, as I mentioned with an example on our call, gives us strength not only in net new to NetApp customers on the Public Cloud, but also an opportunity to displace their previous suppliers in their data centers as they harmonize their cloud environment with their data center environment and our CloudOps portfolio, Spot, Cloud Insights, CloudCheckr have been a source of great new customer additions. Okay. Let me take that in two parts. So let me first talk about the NAND, SSD market and then talk about the rest of the supply base, if that's all right? On the NAND side, we obviously have strong supplier relationships across the memory industry and are clearly multisource for all elements of our supply portfolio and SSDs. With regard to the recent incident impacting one of the members of that industry ecosystem, they, as you know, are not our leading supplier for SSDs. And so we feel good about the work that we've done on our SSD base. There may be some increases in prices in SSDs, but our engineering and manufacturing team has done a super job, and we expect that for the go-forward, the total storage media cost will be flat year-on-year. So we feel good about that, offsetting certain elements of the supply base with other elements of the supply base. With regard to the broader \u2013 why do we believe product gross margins are a trough in Q4, listen, there's been a lot of work that we have undertaken to deal with the supply constraints? Clearly, we have most of the large volume items and the high dollar items in our supply base are well managed, and we do not see them impacted by the supply constraints that we have seen so far. There are certain elements of our supply base that we are dealing with, with decommits in the quarter that has required us to be in the open market. And we have engineering qualifications going on for all of the major elements to create alternate sources of supply or to engineer our way around those supply constraints. And some of those engineering solutions have reached the market and will come to market over the course of the first half of fiscal year 2023. The second \u2013 the third element is pricing and discount management. As you know, we have communicated previously that we did raise prices in the fall, and we have recently also communicated another impending price increase that takes effect this month. Those two price increases will have the primary impact later in Q4 and going through, for the most part, the benefit will be seen in fiscal year 2023. And those are all the mechanisms that cause us to feel confident that while we have been dealing with the constrained supply base, we have put in place a lot of controls to allow us to feel better about the path forward. I think we're pleased with all of our partnerships. Azure NetApp Files was a really strong performer this quarter as it has been for several quarters now, which demonstrates both our ability and knowledge of how to scale a hyperscaler relationship and the enormous strength and leverage that gives us once it's scaled. I would say the earliest of the three is Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. We announced it in September, and we are very, very pleased with the level of trials and early activity. They have frankly, surpassed our expectations, but it's early in the going. And so it takes time to translate those trials into paid customers and to expand the relationships across the FSx. So, I would say we're excited, but we've got a lot of work to do, and we know where, what that work is. And so you should expect, broadly speaking, I see FSx about 18 months behind where we saw AMS with Microsoft Azure. Google is in between. Google has \u2013 we have seen several big customer successes with Google, and we are working to expand the range of workloads and the range of use cases with them across the portfolio. As Mike mentioned, the new partnerships are not material contributors yet. We are excited about the potential, but you should see that potential realized over the next few years. I think that in the past quarter, the vast majority of the acceleration comes from both new customer additions as well as when you see a really strong dollar-based net retention rate. It shows that once the customer uses one of these cloud portfolios, they expand their use quite substantially. So, I think that's where the vast majority of the progress has been. Listen, we don't see any unusual behavior. We have close relationships with our customers. Clearly, we are monitoring, given the supply chain situation, a very, very tight inspection of our order backlog and our order pipeline. We see healthy broad-based demand but no sense of shadow demand or multiple purchases in our pipeline. So we feel good about the sort of the real demand in the business, and we're doing as much as we can to meet it. Demand, as Mike has said, is outpacing supply. Listen, I won't give you a specific number. I'll just say your read of the industry and our participation in it is in the target range, right? So obviously, we monitor the behavior of the industry and the cost of our supply, and we take appropriate action. We've taken two actions as we mentioned earlier, one in the fall and the second one in February, and we should see the benefits of those play out over time. We have to give our customers the benefit of those orders that are already in flight. Our quotes that are in flight, you have to honor them to be a good partner to customers. But over the course of Q4 and certainly heading into the new fiscal year, you should see the benefits of that come into the business. With regard to the likely duration and so on, listen, we always trade off being a good partner to customers with the need to maintain margins in our business. It's too early for me to comment. We will continue to monitor the situation, and if we make changes, we will let you know. Demand, as we said, demand is outpacing supply. We've been aggressive to meet demand wherever we could. And I'll just say, our team executed really well. I think that we'll just be transparent. Demand has outpaced supply both in Q3 and we expect in Q4. I think, first of all, listen. We know we are clearly ahead of our $1 billion ARR target. We will communicate the long-term targets and our perspectives on the cloud business at our Investor Day, right? So I am really excited about the portfolio we've built. We started with cloud storage. We have natively integrated cloud storage with the world's leading cloud providers, and you are seeing the acceleration of that business. We also expanded our cloud portfolio with a strong position in cloud infrastructure management with Spot, Cloud Insights, CloudCheckr and now Fylamynt helping the entire portfolio get easily adopted by customers. And so I really do feel like we have built two strong beachheads in markets that are expanding to our overall TAM and are demonstrating the ability for us to get new customers and cross-sell and upsell them a lot of different things. So I'm really excited about our portfolio. We continue to be disciplined acquirers and manage shareholder returns, both with investing for the long-term growth of our business while returning a significant amount of free cash flow to shareholders. Listen, I think we continue to see steady broad-based demand, right? It's very solid. It's across a lot of different industries, a lot of different verticals, and they are for use cases that are headline news in the industry, digital transformation, cloud enablement, unstructured data analytics, artificial intelligence, ransomware protection. I mean these are all well-known use cases with broad secular demand. I did not believe that there was a V-shaped recovery, to be honest. I think IT departments are mature buying centers, and they buy steadily over time. I think the year-on-year compares in some cases, were exacerbated by the fact that during COVID, you saw the opposite pattern for many companies. We had a good business pattern even during COVID. So I continue to remain optimistic. Our team has executed excellently. We have gained share in every category that we have played in, and our Hybrid Cloud business has two strong growth engines in object storage and all-flash. Thank you. We feel good about the ability to serve customers in all of the ways that you talked about, absolutely on target. I think we've seen \u2013 while we haven't seen any sort of radical shift in behavior, the long-term trends around cloud and the use of as a service model is broadly defined, continue to be playing out for us. Our cloud portfolio continues to be really, really strong and we are able to help customers deploy workloads very quickly on public cloud environments, if they aren't able to build and deploy an environment in their data center. Keystone also had a good quarter. It's early in the going, but we continue to see more and more vertical industry wins, more and more new customer wins and also wins across our geographic base, just like you would expect us to be focused on when managing an early business. So I feel good about both parts of the business. And then, of course, our differentiated product portfolio, as we said, we're focused on growing all-flash and object storage. We have the best operating system in the market for hybrid flash that had a good quarter. So good execution across the board. Listen, I think these are all the conversations that we have with our supply base. We have good long-term suppliers that support the vast majority of our bond and that we manage directly. There are other components that are integrated into subassemblies in our overall systems that sometimes are \u2013 have been a part of the challenge here. There's sort of multiple discussions there, right? I think clearly, we want to understand the reasons for such a decommit. We want to understand where we are in sort of the ability for the customer \u2013 for the supplier to meet our demand profile. And then there are ways that we have worked really hard in engineering to continue to build diversity of supply across our entire bill of materials and in the cases where we don't feel like we can rely on a supplier to give us access to other suppliers. And so you'll see us continuing to work that over the next several quarters to make sure that we have all the levers at our disposal to meet demand. I mean all-flash arrays clearly, we are the strongest vendor in the mid-range systems and mid-range is displacing traditional high-end systems. So we are in more and more and more customers winning the really high end of the market as well. So really strong broad-based distribution of our portfolio. Our hybrid flash systems have done really well in the entry market. If you look at the entry price bands growth rates, those are much more hybrid flash businesses than all-flash business. And so the combination of those two give us the ability to cover a broad range of use cases with the right form factor. With regard to object storage, it's another extension of our unstructured data portfolio. The unstructured data started out in files for the most part and increasingly, as the scale of those repositories have grown, customers are starting to use object technology to allow for management and ease of administration. Our solutions have been really, really strong. I think we're focused on that market. We have a really good cost-effective, highly scalable, centrally managed object support solution. And even in the object world, we have unique integrations with the Public Cloud that allows us to build a truly hybrid object environment, combining some parts of the environment being in customers' data centers and some parts being in true public cloud under one policy framework. Yes. Listen, I think you hit the points quite accurately. I think we see the improvements in the overall sort of return to work and the impact from omicron, sort of easing through the course of the year, all things remaining the same. And we think that demand continues to be really solid, steady and broad based. And so we're excited about the year ahead. We're certainly not guiding next fiscal. We'll guide when we guide it. But as I said in my remarks, we feel very, very good about the demand picture, and we're working hard to meet it with as much supply as we can get. Thank you. As we wrap up, I want to leave you with three callouts, the sizable and enduring trends of cloud and data-driven digital transformation, where we at NetApp play a critical role in helping customers achieve their goals are driving broad-based customer demand for our products and services. Our embracive cloud has expanded our addressable market. The real opportunity is still in front of us. And thanks to our strong Public Cloud Services performance, we are well ahead of our plan to achieve $1 billion in ARR in fiscal year 2025. Our focused execution and effective management of temporary supply chain headwind enable us to capture our expanding opportunity and deliver operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins. Thank you and I hope to see you at our Investor Day next month, where we will talk more about our long-term growth and value drivers."

Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K including in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections. During the call all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I will now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris and welcome everyone to our Q2 fiscal year '22 earnings call. We delivered another strong quarter, with results all at the high-end or above our guidance. Building on the momentum of last year and the previous quarter, revenue grew 11% year-over-year, with Public Cloud segment revenue growth of 85% and Hybrid Cloud segment revenue growth of 8%. Product revenue grew 9% year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share are all at record highs for the first half of the fiscal year. Our performance reflects continued broad-based customer demand created by the sizeable and long-term trends of cloud and data-driven digital transformation, where NetApp is playing an increasingly important role in helping customers achieve their business and hybrid cloud transformation goals. NetApp is uniquely positioned to solve organizations\u2019 most significant challenges in both modern and traditional applications, on-premises, and in hybrid, multi-cloud environments. As I\u2019ve said many times, our Public Cloud services not only allow us to participate in the rapidly growing cloud market, but they also make us a more strategic data center partner to our enterprise customers, driving share gains in our Hybrid Cloud business. We are seeing this play out in the strong results from both our Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud segments. In Q2, we had a number of announcements that further solidify our leadership position as we continue to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment, while scaling our Public Cloud segment. Public Cloud revenue grew 85% year-over-year, driven by Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Insights, and Spot by NetApp. Public Cloud ARR grew to $388 million, an increase of 80% year-over-year, and Public Cloud dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains healthy at 179%. During Q2, we advanced our cloud agenda significantly, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of reaching $1 billion ARR in fiscal year '25, with a gross margin profile that is accretive to the corporate average. In Q2, Amazon Web Services, AWS, announced the general availability of Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, a native, fully managed AWS storage service powered by ONTAP. This new first party product is fully integrated into the AWS console and is sold, supported, run and billed by AWS, making it easy and cost effective for customers to take advantage of NetApp\u2019s suite of enterprise grade data services while running in an AWS native experience. As we saw with Azure NetApp Files, it will take time for FSx for NetApp ONTAP to ramp, but we are extraordinarily pleased with the early indicators and number of customers piloting this service. Additionally, Google Cloud announced that NetApp will provide storage infrastructure for its Google Distributed Cloud Hosted, where data resides in customer-owned data centers and co-location facilities. Google is previewing the integration of Google Cloud VMware Engine with NetApp Cloud Volumes Service, a fully managed service that helps organizations meet their needs for storage and disaster recovery. We also expanded availability of Cloud Volumes Service in the Google Cloud. Much like any other Google Cloud native service, Cloud Volumes Service can be provisioned and consumed against existing Google Cloud agreements making it easier for customers to expand their cloud engagements with both Google and NetApp. Finally, Microsoft announced that whitelisting has been removed from Azure NetApp Files. Azure NetApp Files has been generally available since May 2019 with customers around the world relying on it to run their most demanding enterprise workloads in the Azure cloud. Now customers can instantaneously leverage Azure NetApp Files to accelerate the deployment of mission-critical enterprise applications to Azure. Additionally, we expanded the backup/restore service and cross region replication capabilities for Azure NetApp Files. We now have fully integrated services with all the major public cloud providers to give organizations the benefits of our storage and data management expertise and experience no matter which cloud they choose. We have deepened each partnership and co-engineered services directly with the cloud providers, enabling their customers to buy directly from them. This level of integration streamlines purchasing, billing, operations and support and eliminates the complexity of additional contracts, product installations, or patching. Importantly for NetApp, these partnerships create a new and massive go-to-market growth engine, as three of the largest and most innovative companies in the world are reselling our technology. Each of these announcements represent years of hard work, partnership, and continuous innovation bringing ONTAP to the cloud at cloud speed and represent the opportunity for continued expansion. We are now the first and only storage environment that is natively integrated into each of the major public cloud providers. We also made significant enhancements to the Spot portfolio. We introduced Spot Security, a new product designed to keep cloud infrastructure secure. Delivering continuous, automated AI-based security, Spot Security analyzes, detects, and prioritizes threats to surface the most critical vulnerabilities and provides actionable compliance, remediation, and prevention. We also released intelligent traffic flow, a new functionality to Spot Elastigroup, which further enhances our customers\u2019 ability to optimize their applications by intelligently managing and controlling incoming network traffic for optimal instance utilization and high performance. Additionally, we announced Spot PC, a fully managed, secured, and continuously optimized desktop service built together with Microsoft to provide a complete solution for Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop. At the beginning of Q3, we closed the acquisition of CloudCheckr, whose industry-leading cloud billing analytics and cloud configuration management, monitoring, and assessments solutions will augment the full suite of Spot services. In addition to being a solid technology acquisition, CloudCheckr will enhance our partner strategy for cloud, and we will leverage the CloudCheckr platform to build and extend distributor and partner businesses in both the private and public sectors. Also in Q2, we held our annual flagship customer event, Insight, with more than 10,000 attendees and we introduced NetAppTV to stay engaged with customers throughout the year. At Insight, we announced enhancements to our hybrid cloud portfolio with the latest version of ONTAP that delivers even better performance for SAN and modern workloads like AI and analytics, expanded capabilities for object storage, increasingly automated storage system management, and autonomous ransomware protection based on machine learning. The strength of our storage offerings was recognized by Gartner, which named NetApp once again as a leader in the 2021 Magic Quadrant for Primary Storage. Gartner called out our robust product and cloud service portfolio as well as Keystone Flex subscription, our comprehensive and flexible storage as a service offering. We were also recognized among this year\u2019s top vendor solutions evaluated in the 2021 Gartner Critical Capabilities for Primary Storage across all use cases. Growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment was driven by strength in Object Storage for the rapidly growing unstructured data and analytics use cases, and our All-flash array portfolio. In Q2, our All-flash array business reached a record high annualized run rate of $3.1 billion, an increase of 22% year-on-year. All-flash arrays now compose 30% of our installed base systems. We see substantial headroom to continue to help existing and new customers modernize their storage environments. Based on our continued strong revenue growth, I\u2019m confident that we once again gained share in the enterprise storage and All-flash array markets. Like everyone in our industry, we are faced with a challenging supply environment. While the situation is dynamic and continues to evolve, we are doing everything we can to mitigate the supply chain headwinds. We believe that we can continue to manage through them and address the substantial customer demand. As Mike will explain, we have factored the ongoing supply chain uncertainty into our guidance for Q3 and the full year. I am pleased with how we have navigated these challenges and want to thank our suppliers for their support and the NetApp team for their hard work in this environment. In summary, our Q2 results reflect healthy momentum, a clear vision, and exceptional execution across our business. As we close the first half of fiscal year '22, I'm proud of our team and what we have accomplished. We continue to bring industry-leading capabilities to market, further enhancing our differentiated position in cloud and software. As our customers accelerate their digital transformation and their adoption of hybrid cloud and hybrid work strategies, we believe we are well-positioned to capture the sizeable opportunity ahead. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to invite you all to join us for our Investor Day on March 22, 2022. Please mark your calendars and stay tuned for more information. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you George. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today\u2019s discussion. Number 1, Q2 was another strong quarter, with results at the high-end or above our guidance; number 2, our business model continues to show significant operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins; number 3, our Cloud business had another outstanding quarter as we march towards the $1 billion ARR target; and number 4, we are increasing our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and Public Cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr, and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year. Now to the details. In fiscal Q2 we delivered strong revenue, gross margin, and operating leverage across the entire business. Outstanding execution by the NetApp team yielded Q2 billings of $1.55 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.57 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Our solid Q2 results were driven by healthy demand across both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high-end of guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.48 billion was up 8% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue throughout fiscal '22. Product revenue of $814 million increased 9% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we\u2019ve seen over the last year, software product revenue of $475 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our All-flash portfolio. Total Q2 recurring support revenue of $590 million increased 7% year-over-year. As George highlighted, our All-flash revenue run rate, which includes both product and support revenue, eclipsed $3 billion for the first time in the company\u2019s history and was up 22% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited Q2 at $388 million, up 80% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, driven by strong growth in Azure NetApp Files, Spot and Cloud Insights. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $87 million, up 85% year-over-year. The growing scale of our Public Cloud platform continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3 of the 11 points in revenue growth. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $677 million was up 13% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. When combined, software product revenue, recurring support and Public Cloud revenue totaled $1.2 billion and increased 13% year-over-year, representing 74% of total revenue, up from 72% in Q2 '21. We ended Q2 with $3.9 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q2 marks the 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for continued recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 68%, reflecting the value of our software portfolio and Public Cloud platform. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 68% in Q2. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 55% and benefited from the continued mix shift towards software-rich All-flash systems. Our recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. We expect Public Cloud gross margins to continue to trend towards our long-term goal of 75% to 80%, as an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business will be built on software-only solutions. We recently introduced the new FSx for ONTAP product with AWS, and also closed the Cloud Checkr acquisition, both are software-only offerings and support our long-term margin goal. Q2 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 24%, an all-time company high. EPS of $1.28 was up 22% year-over-year and also represented a new quarterly record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $298 million and free cash flow was $252 million. DSO in Q2 was an impressive 38 days, highlighting a strong collections process and healthy linearity throughout the quarter. Year-to-date free cash flow of $443 million is up 43% year-over-year. During Q2, we repurchased $125 million in stock and paid out $112 million in cash dividends. In total we returned $237 million to shareholders, representing 94% of free cash flow. We closed Q2 with $4.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. As you all know, the dynamic supply chain headwinds have intensified recently. Our excellent supply chain and procurement team continues to work closely with our partner ecosystem, with the goal of meeting as much customer demand as possible. Towards this goal, we will continue to invest incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments. That said, we do anticipate the supply chain challenges facing the overall technology industry to impact our product revenue and product gross margins in the second half of fiscal '22. These supply chain headwinds, and our ongoing actions to mitigate them, have been factored into our Q3 and updated full year guidance. With our strong execution in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr, and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance. We now expect revenues to grow 9% to 10% year-over-year, even with the challenging supply chain environment. We also have growing confidence in our expanding Public Cloud opportunity, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper and broader cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. As a result, we are raising the guidance on our organic Public Cloud ARR, with a new range of $475 million to $500 million. As you know, we closed the CloudCheckr acquisition early in Q3. We anticipate CloudCheckr to contribute an additional $35 million to $40 million in Public Cloud ARR exiting the year. In total, our new guidance for exit fiscal '22 Public Cloud ARR is $510 million to $540 million, which at the midpoint, implies a 74% increase year-over-year. For fiscal \u201822, we continue to forecast total gross margin to be approximately 68%. However, the current supply chain challenges with temporarily higher freight and expedite charges, will pressure product margins in Q3 and Q4. We now anticipate product margins to be approximately 54% for the full year. We are reaffirming our full-year operating margin guidance of 23% to 24%. We are forecasting operating expenses to range between $2.795 million and $2.815 billion, driven by investment in revenue generating activities, including expanding our Public Cloud portfolio, and investments in both our Cloud and customer success sales teams. Our new OpEx guidance also includes $10 million per quarter from CloudCheckr. As we discussed at our Investor Day last September, we remain committed to growing revenue faster than operating expenses. We are raising our fiscal \u201922 EPS guidance. We now expect EPS to range between $4.90 and $5.10, representing 23% year-over-year growth, at the mid-point. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $60 million and our effective tax-rate will remain at 19%. We remain committed to delivering more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22, as our Hybrid Cloud business continues to fund the growth in our Public Cloud platform. Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase year-over-year. We anticipate consolidated gross margin to range between 67% and 68% and operating margin to be approximately 23%. Assumed in this guidance are Q3 operating expenses of $705 million to $715 million, which includes CloudCheckr. We expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $1.21 and $1.31 per share. Assumed in our Q3 guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $15 million and our tax-rate will be approximately 19%. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in the first half of our fiscal year. The team stayed focused on our core priorities and were not distracted by external events out of their control. We are excited to build on that momentum as we continue to scale a truly differentiated Public Cloud platform, while maintaining an unwavering focus on the Hybrid Cloud business. As George mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day in the spring, where we will further discuss the long-term value drivers for our shareholders, customers and partners. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks Mike. Let\u2019s open the call for Q&A. Please keep to just one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: Yes, thanks. Hey, guys. I guess my question for you George is, as we think about the cloud services business, there is a lot of different elements within their just announced FSx for NetApp ONTAP, obviously, Azure NetApp Files is going well, the whole Spot business and our CloudCheckr. I guess it's hard to figure out from our perspective I think which are going to be the most important, let's call it, 3 to 5 years from now. How would you help us think about that just in terms of magnitude? And I\u2019m particular I\u2019m curious about the FSx business. I mean, how should we be thinking about how important that particular service will be to your cloud services ARR over time?\nGeorge Kurian: I think, first of all, we saw strong performance this past quarter from all three important pieces of our cloud portfolio; Cloud Volumes, which is cloud storage services; Cloud Insights, which is monitoring, and our Spot portfolio, which has dynamic optimization of compute and storage in the cloud. All of them have really strong quarters and we're really pleased. In terms of FSx for ONTAP, I will just say that it's very early days. But we are extraordinarily pleased. Listen, if you look at the cloud file storage market, the public data suggests that Amazon Web Services is the dominant player in that market. And having a needed first party ONTAP Enterprise File storage service in the Amazon cloud is an enormous opportunity. We are doing the innovation and the enablement work to scale that business. We're really pleased with the early results. But we have a long, kind of, we will see that play out over the next several quarters, right? Just like Microsoft Azure NetApp files is now a really stellar product for us.\nJason Ader: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKaty Huberty: Yes, thank you. Mike, you sized the profit impact of the supply chain constraints. But what is the impact to product revenue in the back half? And should we think of any shortfall in revenue just contributing to fiscal '23 growth?\nMike Berry: Sure. Thanks for the question, Katy. So hey, let's put it in context a little bit, as we did the guidance for the full year. We feel really good about how Q3 in the fiscal year shaping up. Coming off a really strong Q2, we've raised the revenue growth, even with the tougher supply chain situation. And we're calling for growth across both product and cloud. As we said in the prepared remarks, we've baked all of that into our guidance, we'll work very diligently with our supply chain team, our customers, our partners to make sure we're able to fulfill as much as we can. But we're not going to break out, hey, what was the implication of supply chain? Candidly, we don't want to have two guidance numbers. We fully baked that in, as it relates to fiscal '23, we'll have to see how the second half goes, really in terms of does it continue into our fiscal '23. At what level? And how does it work its way through the rest of this fiscal year.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think broadly speaking, our team has managed the environment really well. And I think if you look at the second half guidance, my expectation is you should see that continued progression of the first half trends with product and cloud services growing quickly, and our services business growing a little bit slower than that in the overall revenue mix.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall: Yes, great. Thanks for the question. I wanted to dig back into the cloud services, George, a little bit. A couple of questions for me. One thing we've seen in the industry kind of emerging is direct hardware sales into some application in hyper scalars for low cost flash storage. And I wonder if I know that you're amortizing hardware as a service, sort of in some of these instances. But I wonder if you see an opportunity to maybe directly sell hardware into some of these things for specific applications. And I'm also curious, just strategically, I know, the question was asked earlier, what are these three services are going to be bigger? But where do you take this strategically? Can you give us some way to think about, kind of where you're taking as a service part of the business, where the opportunities lie, where you think the most opportunity is? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think with regard to our approach to serve customers, together with the cloud providers, we look at a broad range of opportunities. I think they don't exist solely in the Public Cloud. I think you could see, for example, the, in my prepared remarks, the commentary on working with Google around a distributed cloud platform and so, you'll see us continue to broaden the range of innovation opportunities that we deliver with the hyper scalars so that we can truly build a hybrid multi cloud data management and infrastructure services management platform with them. I think within the public cloud, there are going to be continued opportunities for substantial growth. I think as I said, we feel really, really good about the progress towards the $1 billion ARR targets that we had laid out. We will share more about the specific updates to our long-term plans at our analysts conference, right, let but let me just say, Cloud Storage is a massive opportunity. Cloud file storage alone is a very rapidly growing multibillion opportunity. And we are positioned at the sweet spot of that alongside the biggest three cloud providers in the world. Second, cloud compute management and cloud cost management is another massively important customer priority. And Spot plus CloudCheckr gives us a differentiated platform to go after that set of use cases. And we see more and more types of workloads collapsing onto these two important elements of Infrastructure as a Service, and Cloud Insights, our monitoring platform service customers not only deploy those infrastructure services, but also monitor them. So I feel really, really, really good about our cloud progress.\nRod Hall: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is open.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, thank you. I was hoping you could discuss how you plan to integrate CloudCheckr into your cloud insights and spa portfolio. And as you address that question, as you grow the cloud business toward this $1 billion target and drive gross margins in the high 70s. Should we expect a cloud business can achieve operating margins, maybe in line with the corporate average? Or could that actually happen earlier, given the go-to-market appears to be shifting to your cloud partners, rather than relying simply on your own sales force? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think with regard to CloudCheckr, what spot allows customers to do is to optimize their cloud spend by dynamically deploying cloud computing and storage environments, on the most efficient platform available, right. So we addressed about 70% of the customers spend using the Spot technology. What CloudCheckr allows customers to do is to first be able to analyze and prioritize which of those environments they should move to Spot first and most quickly, so that they can get the best savings. And then subsequently, also gives them an integrated build for their entire environment now optimized with Spot. So we're excited about what CloudCheckr brings from a technology perspective. From a route to market perspective, it has a strong footprint in public sector, and in managed service providers who use it as an integrated billing and analytics platform for all of their downstream customers. And so it expands our reach into the marketplace. With regard to cloud operating margins, today, we don't break our operating margins. I would just tell you, that we are a highly leveraged operating model for the company, if you look at the first half of this year, more than 50% of total revenue growth fell to the bottom line. We see the opportunity in cloud to be a fast growing high gross margin opportunity. And we are going to invest to capture that. But we are doing so while continuing to drive the operating margin profile of the total company. So I'm excited about possibilities ahead and the continued increase in margin rich software and cloud services in our portfolio. Mike, you have anything else?\nMike Berry: Yes, thanks, George. Karl, I would just add a couple things to what George said. We do benefit in a couple ways as it relates to the cloud business. One is there's a lot of synergies in R&D, because as you know, ONTAP goes across both of those. So that will help, as you call it, the operating margin, even though we don't break it out. The other thing we've talked about is yes, the route to market and the hyperscalers sales channel certainly helps. We also have our own sales team as well. They will get more and more efficient, especially as we build up that customer success team. So as we look at that $1 billion target, as we've talked about, you look at the comps that have about a $1 billion of ARR. And certainly those operating margins are very near our corporate average today.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. Just one more cloud question for you, George, you talked about how you now have fully integrated services with all the cloud service providers. How do you think you start to leverage that? Can you sort of give us a roadmap for how that builds upon itself? And where you would see initial success from having that full portfolio and then maybe later success? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes, certainly, we have three ways that we drive success in the cloud business. The first is technology certification and workload expansion. So we work with the cloud providers to qualify more and more and more workloads that can be best served using our technology. An example that I cited recently is the VMware, cloud in Google, now being certified to use NetApp Cloud Volumes as the primary as a primary data store, which has enormous benefits to VMware customers of NetApp and VMware to be able to now expand to the cloud as well as new customers that want to deploy mission critical environments on the VMware Cloud, right. So that's one. Workload certifications and expansions, the second is additional regions, and enablement for the go-to-market engines. You've seen us grow the Azure NetApp files business steadily and very successfully over a period of time. Amazon and Google are behind that. But we know the recipe and we're working to scale that. And then finally, cross-selling and upselling and customer wants to get on our service. Dollar based net retention rate is a very healthy 179%. It's early days in our customer base. So over time, that should come down. But it shows that once a customer uses one of our services, they expand dramatically, and then we get to sell them a portfolio of more services. So lots of ways to grow our cloud business ahead. We're super excited. And we worked really, really hard to get here and we're going to capitalize on the opportunity.\nSteven Fox: Thanks for that. That's very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I want to see if you could maybe unpack a little bit of the trends you're seeing in the traditional storage market. In particular, we're seeing very strong growth from your All-flash business, which would imply that there are aspects that are declining, and at least one of your competitors seems to be suffering, some steep declines at the high-end. I'm wondering if maybe mid range and flash is encroaching on more high-end performance? And how you see the sub segments trending for NetApp? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes, absolutely. I think we have said for a long time, that mid range systems with clustering software, will cannibalize the high-end free memory business of some of our competitors. And you're seeing that play out. The mid range systems offer the sweet spot from a price performance standpoint for our customers. And with clustering, you can build enormously large environments to consolidate a range of different workloads. And we expect that trend to continue going forward, the days of the free [indiscernible] are over to be completely transparent. And so we'll continue to see that trend going on over time. With regard to how these -- within our business, All-flash arrays will have an important and growing part of the customers data center. Hybrid Flash arrays will continue to have a long-term position in the data center. So today in our installed base, for example, all flash is about a 30% of the installed base. We expect as more flash technologies come to play that number to grow to about 70% over time. I think, however, we do not subscribe to the theory that hard disk drives no longer have value, they will have enduring value for certain sets of workloads that they are built for capacity oriented workloads, backup and archival, media retention, images, things like that. So we feel good about our position in the market. We're going to stay focused and continue to execute against our All-flash array business and our object storage businesses priorities for the enterprise storage environment. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is open.\nNik Todorov: Yes, Thanks and congrats on another great quarter. Another question on the Hybrid Cloud side. It sounds to me that you're seeing accelerating demand there. So the question is, given the supply chain challenges, how much visibility do you have from a pipeline perspective? I think you talked about seeing is very strong second half. Also, are you seeing any of normal backlog at this point? And what kind of impact do you think that could have on your model in the second half and forward. Thanks.\nMike Berry: Hey, Nik, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. Yes, we feel very good about the demand environment. As we look at the second half, we certainly have a much better view at this point now and pipeline going into the second half. And as we've talked about, a lot of what's baked into the guidance is really a result of supply chain. Again, we feel really good about the overall demand environment. There is -- as we look at backlog, there's really been no significant shift there. And I do also want to make sure a note, we haven't seen any what I would call unusual Poland's either, as it relates to purchasing behavior on a quarterly basis is there's always pull ins and push outs. We haven't seen anything unusual there either. So going into second half feel really good about what the pipeline looks like in the buying behavior of our customers. And hopefully that continues as we go forward into next year.\nNik Todorov: Sounds great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you. George and Mike, now is hopefully society is getting back to a little bit of more normalcy post the pandemic hopefully. Can you compare and contrast, like the purchasing trends that you're seeing, pre versus post, is it longer lead times because of supply chain, you think that might be here for good or more of a push to cloud or All-flash away, I'm just kind of compare and contrast of what you saw may be pre-pandemic versus now in the discussions you're having with customers. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We see continuing trends for digital transformation, hybrid work and hybrid IT, those have been our long-term perspective on how business architectures and technology architectures evolve. That has certainly come sharper into focus with COVID. But they have always been part of the long-term roadmap of our customers. We have seen the acceleration of cloud-based environments for certain workloads, especially workloads, like virtual desktops, or in schools for the ability for teachers to be able to use cloud based environments to conduct classrooms, and we think those will continue on and you're going forward, as the future of work remains hybrid. Within the enterprise storage environments, we've always believed that flash will have a growing part of the customer data center, as the economics of flash and the ability to consolidate and simplify your data center environment grows. That being said, there are workloads like I've mentioned earlier in the call that will continue to stay on hard drives. And I think the big early draft to flash is now sort of stabilizing and people understand what flash is going to be used for, and understand what HDDs are going to be used for. And so we see a more steady pattern there. With regard to, lead times and transactions and things like that, as Mike mentioned, we didn't see anything unusual. We have been able to meet customers through a variety of mechanisms, digital conferences, using video conferencing mechanisms, as well as now starting to meet some customers in person. And so we expect that to continue going forward for a period of time, at least.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much, and congratulations to you and your teams.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTim Long: Thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and strategy given, commodity moving prices and obviously inflation that you're facing on the supply chain side. Could you just talk a little bit about how you see that kind of flowing through the model over the next few quarters here? And what do you think competitors will be doing? And will there be any differentiation in how some view NetApp and some of the other -- your peer companies are going to tackle these challenges in a market where sometimes pricing is somewhat of a factor. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Hey, Tim. It's Mike. So, yes, so thanks for the question. We have not seen much of a change in the pricing environment. As we've talked about before, it's still relatively rational marquee [ph] everyone's a while somebody does something to grab a customer or keep one. But that's going to certainly be an unusual event. As we've looked forward, look I won't speak for any of our competitors. I think everybody's looking at their business saying, hey, costs have gone up across the board, especially in freight component costs. We're all dealing with that. So I do expect that you will continue to hear folks talk about doing price increases. I think a lot of this depends on how long we're in this situation. Again, from a NetApp perspective, we've looked at that. We have implemented a price increase. So we do expect that to start to have an impact later in our fiscal year. I would expect to continue to see that across our competitors. But again, I don't want to speak for them. I think a lot of this depends on how long this short supply chain shortage last, and as well our component manufacturers, how they approach the market as well.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the free cash flow. So based on your full year guidance, it would imply about 60% of the full year free cash flow, what happened the second half of the fiscal year? That's below the 5 year average of color about 70%. It's definitely lower since maybe 2015. First of all, is my math right, second if so anything you would highlight that may change this cash flow seasonality? And particularly, do you expect supply constrained being a factor in terms of cash flow generation? Thanks.\nMike Berry: All right. Hey, awesome, thanks for the capital question. So yes, let's talk about it and let's start at the top. We did guide for free cash flow $1.2 billion or greater, so let's do operating cash first, that would imply for your operating cash off, call it, 1.425 billion. To your point, we've already generated $540 million. So what you saw in Q2 was a record for us low DSLs. We had a great collections quarter in Q2, that did pull forward some collections into Q2. So as we look at the second half of '22, you should expect to see the seasonality as you called it be a little bit lower in the second half, because of the really strong Q2. Still getting to at least that, that $1.4 billion operating cash number. As on your question about supply chain, we have baked in an assumption that we'll continue to invest in inventory. You saw that our inventory turns went from 17 in Q1 to 13 in Q2, that was planned. We talked about that with you folks as well for the last couple of quarters. So we have baked that into our assumption. Going forward, I think you should expect to see kind of the seasonal averages return. Again, it was just in a very, very good Q2 from a collections perspective. And I wouldn't expect that to continue into the future. So again, thanks for that question. Hopefully that answers your question.\nSidney Ho: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital. Your line is open.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes, thanks and congrats on strong Public Cloud services. That's great to see. On the overall business, buildings did decelerate pretty materially on a year-over-year basis. Can you talk to what were the dynamics behind that? And then why do you say you feel good about the pipeline giving -- given the billings?\nGeorge Kurian: Sure. So thanks, Nehal and hello. So as we talked about in Q1, billings grew by about 20%. In Q2 billings grew by about 7%. Keep in mind that so on a -- on a year-to-date basis, right around 12% to 13% growth, that number is going to jump around a little bit each quarter based on the dynamics of deferred revenue, as well as FX as well. So we calculate billings as net revenue in the quarter and then quarter-over-quarter change in deferred excluding the impact of FX in deferred. So that's going to move the numbers a little bit, there's a little bit of seasonality to that. So looking forward, we would expect to continue to see billings overall grow at or above the revenue number. And again, I would encourage you -- and take a look at the year-to-date number or the trailing 12 months. Billings will jump around a little bit based on the components of our billings, mix matters as well as seasonality.\nNehal Chokshi: Got it. Great. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. On your guide for Q3 and Q4, maybe you can express this a little differently on the puts and takes from Q3 to Q4 trajectory. Are you expecting component issues to be resolved through Q3? And that drives better seasonality Q3 to Q4? Or is there something else like a better pipeline? For Q4, Mike, you also mentioned increased pricing as well. So maybe you could bridge Q3 to Q4, that'd be helpful.\nGeorge Kurian: Q4 is the finish of our fiscal year, as you might know, we run a semi-annual plan. And so, we had a strong Q2, and we'll have a strong Q4. So that reflects the seasonality in our business, driven by our compensation planning, as well as customer buying through the year. I think with regard to margins, I'll have Mike cover that. In terms of the supply chain and the margin profile, I would just tell you, we do not expect the near-term resolution of the supply situation. What we have seen through excellent execution with our teams and our partners is that component costs for the full year are largely flat year-on-year . There are some elements of the components that are up year-on-year and others that are down year-on-year, but as we have said before, component costs are largely flat on a year-on-year basis. I think what we see is really the expedite and freight costs that are at a premium now, and that is reflected in the pricing left that we have implemented at the start of November, and which will take some time to flow through our systems. I will let Mike characterize.\nMike Berry: Great. Thank you, George. And just add to that, on this specific question, Wamsi, if you go from Q3 to Q4, a couple of things to keep in mind. One is, hey, the services revenue will continue to grow, you're going to see Cloud Support, hopefully professional services that add to that quarter-on-quarter growth. As we look at Q4 versus Q3 to George's point, always want our seasonally high quarter. We're doing a lot of work not only in supply chain, but in engineering and in other things to make sure that we can deliver as much as we can in Q4. And then certainly the price increase, it'll take a little bit of time to work its way through the system. So add all those together in those. That's what added up into our guidance, our implied guide for Q3 and Q4.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes, perfect. Thank you and thanks for taking my question. I guess the questions is around cloud services business. George, I was just wondering how -- when you think about AWS partnership somewhat in the early stages, how would you stack that up against Azure at this time? Just anything in terms of number of pilots or the workload that you bring with AWS right now, what would you do with Azure? And then really when I think about the $1 billion roadmap that you've given us, a while back, did you envision the AWS partnership, especially how fully integrated NetApp is on the console, and the fact that AWS is proactively selling NetApp? Did you envision all this in the $1 billion roadmap? Or is this incremental to that narrative?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think first of all, AWS and Azure have enormous scale and reach into the customer base. These are trillion dollar corporations with enormous impact on the IT market. And we are honored to work with both of them. They have different approaches to the customer base and different ways and different strengths. And so we're excited to work with Amazon and Microsoft. I think the overall opportunity set reflects their scale in the market, right. So Amazon has massive market presence and market share. I think in the file space, they are a very large part of the files market. So the fact that we have a play with them gives us enormous scale into the file storage market. I think, we are from an execution standpoint, listen, we've learned a lot over the last few years. We know what it takes to scale a business. And we've done that in partnership with Microsoft. We continue to scale that with innovation and co-engineering and go-to-market. But we are also taking some of those lessons learned into how we can scale other services more quickly. With regard to the $1 billion plants, listen, we always believed that we would be working with multiple hyperscalars. I don't think you should assume that we were cocky enough to say that we had that in the bag. But we had that as part of our roadmap and we're honored to have the partnership with AWS. I think, as I said, I feel very, very good about where we are in our roadmap to a $1 billion. We'll tell you more about the timing and the mix and all of that when we get to Analysts Date, right, but I feel really good about where we are.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Yes, George and Mike, I guess, nice on the business model. How do you guys think about the interplay, or the trade off maybe in a place last trade off? Now that the margins continue to expand? I think you guys are actually absorbing like 100 to 200 basis points of op origin, sort of expense, supply chain, kind of components, et cetera, which really has the margins already be in the mid 20%. If we're at 25% or so, how do you guys think about the interplay between investing and growth, investing in M&A as the margins continue to go up, seemingly towards 30%. Appreciate it. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: So a great, great question. So as we've talked about for the last couple years is our goal is to continue to invest in the business to drive growth. Being fully cognizant of investing in operating expense and COGS at a lower rate than revenue to drive a margins. You saw an incredible really operating leverage so far this year. And if you take the midpoint of the guide, your revenue is up almost $550 million year-over-year, on a $118 million or $120 million, pick your favorite number, OpEx number. So we're continuing to drive really good scale while investing in the business. We will continue to do that going forward, very much focused not only on where we need to invest, but what does that return. That's why we're so focused on cloud as well as incremental sales and product development. So you should expect to see us continue to invest going forward. Now outside of OpEx, we've talked about it before, we will continue to be active in M&A. And we're still allocating at least 30% of our free cash flow. Plus, we have a very nice cash balance and a lot of flexibility on the balance sheet to fund acquisitions. So, yes, you should expect to see us continue to increase OpEx to drive growth, as well as be active in the M&A market.\nAnanda Baruah: So it sounds like opportunity to keep accelerating revenue growth, expanding margins and get bigger in M&A, the free cash flow goes up like \u2026\nGeorge Kurian: And doesn't that sound like fun? That's exactly what we're focused on.\nAnanda Baruah: Thanks, guys.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess my question was just following up on the pricing discussion earlier. You mentioned you've taken some pricing and the flow through would take a bit of time. Just how should we think about the stickiness of those price increases? Are they as supply chain kind of eases to those price increases we have competed away? And I'm just trying to think how much for benefit can they be like the next fiscal year as they take time to flow into the P&L? Or how sticky can they be? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes, great, great questions. So as you look at the rest of this fiscal year, and I'll work it into next year, you shouldn't really expect to see much of a benefit in Q3. There's a lot of cones in flight, it takes a while for that to take effect. So we expect to start to see some of that in Q4. As we roll into '23, I think it depends on a lot of things. The earlier question on what are your competitors doing? What's the overall pricing environment? What happens with component costs and freight? I think there's a lot in that for us to be able to say, hey, we think X amount sticks. Certainly we are very disciplined around our pricing. And we want to ensure that we are doing the right things for our customers, while we are taking care of covering our costs as well. So we'll be very focused on it. We'll talk to you as we guide to next year on the impact of that. But I did want to be clear just on the impact of '22. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We have delivered a solid first half with great operating leverage in our business model as we grow revenues and margins. We're gaining share in the key markets of All-flash and Object Storage, while rapidly scaling our Public Cloud business. The innovation we bring to market and our unique and deep cloud partnerships, position us well to execute again, the significant opportunity ahead. We increased our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and Public Cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year. Thank you. I look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter and at our upcoming Investor Day in March.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you George. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion. Number 1, Q2 was another strong quarter, with results at the high-end or above our guidance; number 2, our business model continues to show significant operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins; number 3, our Cloud business had another outstanding quarter as we march towards the $1 billion ARR target; and number 4, we are increasing our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and Public Cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr, and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year. Now to the details. In fiscal Q2 we delivered strong revenue, gross margin, and operating leverage across the entire business. Outstanding execution by the NetApp team yielded Q2 billings of $1.55 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.57 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Our solid Q2 results were driven by healthy demand across both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high-end of guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.48 billion was up 8% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue throughout fiscal '22. Product revenue of $814 million increased 9% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we've seen over the last year, software product revenue of $475 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our All-flash portfolio. Total Q2 recurring support revenue of $590 million increased 7% year-over-year. As George highlighted, our All-flash revenue run rate, which includes both product and support revenue, eclipsed $3 billion for the first time in the company's history and was up 22% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited Q2 at $388 million, up 80% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, driven by strong growth in Azure NetApp Files, Spot and Cloud Insights. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $87 million, up 85% year-over-year. The growing scale of our Public Cloud platform continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3 of the 11 points in revenue growth. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $677 million was up 13% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. When combined, software product revenue, recurring support and Public Cloud revenue totaled $1.2 billion and increased 13% year-over-year, representing 74% of total revenue, up from 72% in Q2 '21. We ended Q2 with $3.9 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q2 marks the 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for continued recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 68%, reflecting the value of our software portfolio and Public Cloud platform. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 68% in Q2. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 55% and benefited from the continued mix shift towards software-rich All-flash systems. Our recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. We expect Public Cloud gross margins to continue to trend towards our long-term goal of 75% to 80%, as an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business will be built on software-only solutions. We recently introduced the new FSx for ONTAP product with AWS, and also closed the Cloud Checkr acquisition, both are software-only offerings and support our long-term margin goal. Q2 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 24%, an all-time company high. EPS of $1.28 was up 22% year-over-year and also represented a new quarterly record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $298 million and free cash flow was $252 million. DSO in Q2 was an impressive 38 days, highlighting a strong collections process and healthy linearity throughout the quarter. Year-to-date free cash flow of $443 million is up 43% year-over-year. During Q2, we repurchased $125 million in stock and paid out $112 million in cash dividends. In total we returned $237 million to shareholders, representing 94% of free cash flow. We closed Q2 with $4.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. As you all know, the dynamic supply chain headwinds have intensified recently. Our excellent supply chain and procurement team continues to work closely with our partner ecosystem, with the goal of meeting as much customer demand as possible. Towards this goal, we will continue to invest incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments. That said, we do anticipate the supply chain challenges facing the overall technology industry to impact our product revenue and product gross margins in the second half of fiscal '22. These supply chain headwinds, and our ongoing actions to mitigate them, have been factored into our Q3 and updated full year guidance. With our strong execution in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr, and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance. We now expect revenues to grow 9% to 10% year-over-year, even with the challenging supply chain environment. We also have growing confidence in our expanding Public Cloud opportunity, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper and broader cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. As a result, we are raising the guidance on our organic Public Cloud ARR, with a new range of $475 million to $500 million. As you know, we closed the CloudCheckr acquisition early in Q3. We anticipate CloudCheckr to contribute an additional $35 million to $40 million in Public Cloud ARR exiting the year. In total, our new guidance for exit fiscal '22 Public Cloud ARR is $510 million to $540 million, which at the midpoint, implies a 74% increase year-over-year. For fiscal \u201822, we continue to forecast total gross margin to be approximately 68%. However, the current supply chain challenges with temporarily higher freight and expedite charges, will pressure product margins in Q3 and Q4. We now anticipate product margins to be approximately 54% for the full year. We are reaffirming our full-year operating margin guidance of 23% to 24%. We are forecasting operating expenses to range between $2.795 million and $2.815 billion, driven by investment in revenue generating activities, including expanding our Public Cloud portfolio, and investments in both our Cloud and customer success sales teams. Our new OpEx guidance also includes $10 million per quarter from CloudCheckr. As we discussed at our Investor Day last September, we remain committed to growing revenue faster than operating expenses. We are raising our fiscal '22 EPS guidance. We now expect EPS to range between $4.90 and $5.10, representing 23% year-over-year growth, at the mid-point. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $60 million and our effective tax-rate will remain at 19%. We remain committed to delivering more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22, as our Hybrid Cloud business continues to fund the growth in our Public Cloud platform. Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase year-over-year. We anticipate consolidated gross margin to range between 67% and 68% and operating margin to be approximately 23%. Assumed in this guidance are Q3 operating expenses of $705 million to $715 million, which includes CloudCheckr. We expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $1.21 and $1.31 per share. Assumed in our Q3 guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $15 million and our tax-rate will be approximately 19%. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in the first half of our fiscal year. The team stayed focused on our core priorities and were not distracted by external events out of their control. We are excited to build on that momentum as we continue to scale a truly differentiated Public Cloud platform, while maintaining an unwavering focus on the Hybrid Cloud business. As George mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day in the spring, where we will further discuss the long-term value drivers for our shareholders, customers and partners. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Sure. Thanks for the question, Katy. So hey, let's put it in context a little bit, as we did the guidance for the full year. We feel really good about how Q3 in the fiscal year shaping up. Coming off a really strong Q2, we've raised the revenue growth, even with the tougher supply chain situation. And we're calling for growth across both product and cloud. As we said in the prepared remarks, we've baked all of that into our guidance, we'll work very diligently with our supply chain team, our customers, our partners to make sure we're able to fulfill as much as we can. But we're not going to break out, hey, what was the implication of supply chain? Candidly, we don't want to have two guidance numbers. We fully baked that in, as it relates to fiscal '23, we'll have to see how the second half goes, really in terms of does it continue into our fiscal '23. At what level? And how does it work its way through the rest of this fiscal year. Yes, thanks, George. Karl, I would just add a couple things to what George said. We do benefit in a couple ways as it relates to the cloud business. One is there's a lot of synergies in R&D, because as you know, ONTAP goes across both of those. So that will help, as you call it, the operating margin, even though we don't break it out. The other thing we've talked about is yes, the route to market and the hyperscalers sales channel certainly helps. We also have our own sales team as well. They will get more and more efficient, especially as we build up that customer success team. So as we look at that $1 billion target, as we've talked about, you look at the comps that have about a $1 billion of ARR. And certainly those operating margins are very near our corporate average today. Hey, Nik, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. Yes, we feel very good about the demand environment. As we look at the second half, we certainly have a much better view at this point now and pipeline going into the second half. And as we've talked about, a lot of what's baked into the guidance is really a result of supply chain. Again, we feel really good about the overall demand environment. There is -- as we look at backlog, there's really been no significant shift there. And I do also want to make sure a note, we haven't seen any what I would call unusual Poland's either, as it relates to purchasing behavior on a quarterly basis is there's always pull ins and push outs. We haven't seen anything unusual there either. So going into second half feel really good about what the pipeline looks like in the buying behavior of our customers. And hopefully that continues as we go forward into next year. Hey, Tim. It's Mike. So, yes, so thanks for the question. We have not seen much of a change in the pricing environment. As we've talked about before, it's still relatively rational marquee [ph] everyone's a while somebody does something to grab a customer or keep one. But that's going to certainly be an unusual event. As we've looked forward, look I won't speak for any of our competitors. I think everybody's looking at their business saying, hey, costs have gone up across the board, especially in freight component costs. We're all dealing with that. So I do expect that you will continue to hear folks talk about doing price increases. I think a lot of this depends on how long we're in this situation. Again, from a NetApp perspective, we've looked at that. We have implemented a price increase. So we do expect that to start to have an impact later in our fiscal year. I would expect to continue to see that across our competitors. But again, I don't want to speak for them. I think a lot of this depends on how long this short supply chain shortage last, and as well our component manufacturers, how they approach the market as well. All right. Hey, awesome, thanks for the capital question. So yes, let's talk about it and let's start at the top. We did guide for free cash flow $1.2 billion or greater, so let's do operating cash first, that would imply for your operating cash off, call it, 1.425 billion. To your point, we've already generated $540 million. So what you saw in Q2 was a record for us low DSLs. We had a great collections quarter in Q2, that did pull forward some collections into Q2. So as we look at the second half of '22, you should expect to see the seasonality as you called it be a little bit lower in the second half, because of the really strong Q2. Still getting to at least that, that $1.4 billion operating cash number. As on your question about supply chain, we have baked in an assumption that we'll continue to invest in inventory. You saw that our inventory turns went from 17 in Q1 to 13 in Q2, that was planned. We talked about that with you folks as well for the last couple of quarters. So we have baked that into our assumption. Going forward, I think you should expect to see kind of the seasonal averages return. Again, it was just in a very, very good Q2 from a collections perspective. And I wouldn't expect that to continue into the future. So again, thanks for that question. Hopefully that answers your question. Great. Thank you, George. And just add to that, on this specific question, Wamsi, if you go from Q3 to Q4, a couple of things to keep in mind. One is, hey, the services revenue will continue to grow, you're going to see Cloud Support, hopefully professional services that add to that quarter-on-quarter growth. As we look at Q4 versus Q3 to George's point, always want our seasonally high quarter. We're doing a lot of work not only in supply chain, but in engineering and in other things to make sure that we can deliver as much as we can in Q4. And then certainly the price increase, it'll take a little bit of time to work its way through the system. So add all those together in those. That's what added up into our guidance, our implied guide for Q3 and Q4. Thank you."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks, Kris and welcome everyone to our Q2 fiscal year '22 earnings call. We delivered another strong quarter, with results all at the high-end or above our guidance. Building on the momentum of last year and the previous quarter, revenue grew 11% year-over-year, with Public Cloud segment revenue growth of 85% and Hybrid Cloud segment revenue growth of 8%. Product revenue grew 9% year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share are all at record highs for the first half of the fiscal year. Our performance reflects continued broad-based customer demand created by the sizeable and long-term trends of cloud and data-driven digital transformation, where NetApp is playing an increasingly important role in helping customers achieve their business and hybrid cloud transformation goals. NetApp is uniquely positioned to solve organizations' most significant challenges in both modern and traditional applications, on-premises, and in hybrid, multi-cloud environments. As I've said many times, our Public Cloud services not only allow us to participate in the rapidly growing cloud market, but they also make us a more strategic data center partner to our enterprise customers, driving share gains in our Hybrid Cloud business. We are seeing this play out in the strong results from both our Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud segments. In Q2, we had a number of announcements that further solidify our leadership position as we continue to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment, while scaling our Public Cloud segment. Public Cloud revenue grew 85% year-over-year, driven by Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Insights, and Spot by NetApp. Public Cloud ARR grew to $388 million, an increase of 80% year-over-year, and Public Cloud dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains healthy at 179%. During Q2, we advanced our cloud agenda significantly, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of reaching $1 billion ARR in fiscal year '25, with a gross margin profile that is accretive to the corporate average. In Q2, Amazon Web Services, AWS, announced the general availability of Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, a native, fully managed AWS storage service powered by ONTAP. This new first party product is fully integrated into the AWS console and is sold, supported, run and billed by AWS, making it easy and cost effective for customers to take advantage of NetApp's suite of enterprise grade data services while running in an AWS native experience. As we saw with Azure NetApp Files, it will take time for FSx for NetApp ONTAP to ramp, but we are extraordinarily pleased with the early indicators and number of customers piloting this service. Additionally, Google Cloud announced that NetApp will provide storage infrastructure for its Google Distributed Cloud Hosted, where data resides in customer-owned data centers and co-location facilities. Google is previewing the integration of Google Cloud VMware Engine with NetApp Cloud Volumes Service, a fully managed service that helps organizations meet their needs for storage and disaster recovery. We also expanded availability of Cloud Volumes Service in the Google Cloud. Much like any other Google Cloud native service, Cloud Volumes Service can be provisioned and consumed against existing Google Cloud agreements making it easier for customers to expand their cloud engagements with both Google and NetApp. Finally, Microsoft announced that whitelisting has been removed from Azure NetApp Files. Azure NetApp Files has been generally available since May 2019 with customers around the world relying on it to run their most demanding enterprise workloads in the Azure cloud. Now customers can instantaneously leverage Azure NetApp Files to accelerate the deployment of mission-critical enterprise applications to Azure. Additionally, we expanded the backup/restore service and cross region replication capabilities for Azure NetApp Files. We now have fully integrated services with all the major public cloud providers to give organizations the benefits of our storage and data management expertise and experience no matter which cloud they choose. We have deepened each partnership and co-engineered services directly with the cloud providers, enabling their customers to buy directly from them. This level of integration streamlines purchasing, billing, operations and support and eliminates the complexity of additional contracts, product installations, or patching. Importantly for NetApp, these partnerships create a new and massive go-to-market growth engine, as three of the largest and most innovative companies in the world are reselling our technology. Each of these announcements represent years of hard work, partnership, and continuous innovation bringing ONTAP to the cloud at cloud speed and represent the opportunity for continued expansion. We are now the first and only storage environment that is natively integrated into each of the major public cloud providers. We also made significant enhancements to the Spot portfolio. We introduced Spot Security, a new product designed to keep cloud infrastructure secure. Delivering continuous, automated AI-based security, Spot Security analyzes, detects, and prioritizes threats to surface the most critical vulnerabilities and provides actionable compliance, remediation, and prevention. We also released intelligent traffic flow, a new functionality to Spot Elastigroup, which further enhances our customers' ability to optimize their applications by intelligently managing and controlling incoming network traffic for optimal instance utilization and high performance. Additionally, we announced Spot PC, a fully managed, secured, and continuously optimized desktop service built together with Microsoft to provide a complete solution for Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop. At the beginning of Q3, we closed the acquisition of CloudCheckr, whose industry-leading cloud billing analytics and cloud configuration management, monitoring, and assessments solutions will augment the full suite of Spot services. In addition to being a solid technology acquisition, CloudCheckr will enhance our partner strategy for cloud, and we will leverage the CloudCheckr platform to build and extend distributor and partner businesses in both the private and public sectors. Also in Q2, we held our annual flagship customer event, Insight, with more than 10,000 attendees and we introduced NetAppTV to stay engaged with customers throughout the year. At Insight, we announced enhancements to our hybrid cloud portfolio with the latest version of ONTAP that delivers even better performance for SAN and modern workloads like AI and analytics, expanded capabilities for object storage, increasingly automated storage system management, and autonomous ransomware protection based on machine learning. The strength of our storage offerings was recognized by Gartner, which named NetApp once again as a leader in the 2021 Magic Quadrant for Primary Storage. Gartner called out our robust product and cloud service portfolio as well as Keystone Flex subscription, our comprehensive and flexible storage as a service offering. We were also recognized among this year's top vendor solutions evaluated in the 2021 Gartner Critical Capabilities for Primary Storage across all use cases. Growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment was driven by strength in Object Storage for the rapidly growing unstructured data and analytics use cases, and our All-flash array portfolio. In Q2, our All-flash array business reached a record high annualized run rate of $3.1 billion, an increase of 22% year-on-year. All-flash arrays now compose 30% of our installed base systems. We see substantial headroom to continue to help existing and new customers modernize their storage environments. Based on our continued strong revenue growth, I'm confident that we once again gained share in the enterprise storage and All-flash array markets. Like everyone in our industry, we are faced with a challenging supply environment. While the situation is dynamic and continues to evolve, we are doing everything we can to mitigate the supply chain headwinds. We believe that we can continue to manage through them and address the substantial customer demand. As Mike will explain, we have factored the ongoing supply chain uncertainty into our guidance for Q3 and the full year. I am pleased with how we have navigated these challenges and want to thank our suppliers for their support and the NetApp team for their hard work in this environment. In summary, our Q2 results reflect healthy momentum, a clear vision, and exceptional execution across our business. As we close the first half of fiscal year '22, I'm proud of our team and what we have accomplished. We continue to bring industry-leading capabilities to market, further enhancing our differentiated position in cloud and software. As our customers accelerate their digital transformation and their adoption of hybrid cloud and hybrid work strategies, we believe we are well-positioned to capture the sizeable opportunity ahead. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to invite you all to join us for our Investor Day on March 22, 2022. Please mark your calendars and stay tuned for more information. I'll now turn it over to Mike. I think, first of all, we saw strong performance this past quarter from all three important pieces of our cloud portfolio; Cloud Volumes, which is cloud storage services; Cloud Insights, which is monitoring, and our Spot portfolio, which has dynamic optimization of compute and storage in the cloud. All of them have really strong quarters and we're really pleased. In terms of FSx for ONTAP, I will just say that it's very early days. But we are extraordinarily pleased. Listen, if you look at the cloud file storage market, the public data suggests that Amazon Web Services is the dominant player in that market. And having a needed first party ONTAP Enterprise File storage service in the Amazon cloud is an enormous opportunity. We are doing the innovation and the enablement work to scale that business. We're really pleased with the early results. But we have a long, kind of, we will see that play out over the next several quarters, right? Just like Microsoft Azure NetApp files is now a really stellar product for us. I think broadly speaking, our team has managed the environment really well. And I think if you look at the second half guidance, my expectation is you should see that continued progression of the first half trends with product and cloud services growing quickly, and our services business growing a little bit slower than that in the overall revenue mix. Listen, I think with regard to our approach to serve customers, together with the cloud providers, we look at a broad range of opportunities. I think they don't exist solely in the Public Cloud. I think you could see, for example, the, in my prepared remarks, the commentary on working with Google around a distributed cloud platform and so, you'll see us continue to broaden the range of innovation opportunities that we deliver with the hyper scalars so that we can truly build a hybrid multi cloud data management and infrastructure services management platform with them. I think within the public cloud, there are going to be continued opportunities for substantial growth. I think as I said, we feel really, really good about the progress towards the $1 billion ARR targets that we had laid out. We will share more about the specific updates to our long-term plans at our analysts conference, right, let but let me just say, Cloud Storage is a massive opportunity. Cloud file storage alone is a very rapidly growing multibillion opportunity. And we are positioned at the sweet spot of that alongside the biggest three cloud providers in the world. Second, cloud compute management and cloud cost management is another massively important customer priority. And Spot plus CloudCheckr gives us a differentiated platform to go after that set of use cases. And we see more and more types of workloads collapsing onto these two important elements of Infrastructure as a Service, and Cloud Insights, our monitoring platform service customers not only deploy those infrastructure services, but also monitor them. So I feel really, really, really good about our cloud progress. Listen, I think with regard to CloudCheckr, what spot allows customers to do is to optimize their cloud spend by dynamically deploying cloud computing and storage environments, on the most efficient platform available, right. So we addressed about 70% of the customers spend using the Spot technology. What CloudCheckr allows customers to do is to first be able to analyze and prioritize which of those environments they should move to Spot first and most quickly, so that they can get the best savings. And then subsequently, also gives them an integrated build for their entire environment now optimized with Spot. So we're excited about what CloudCheckr brings from a technology perspective. From a route to market perspective, it has a strong footprint in public sector, and in managed service providers who use it as an integrated billing and analytics platform for all of their downstream customers. And so it expands our reach into the marketplace. With regard to cloud operating margins, today, we don't break our operating margins. I would just tell you, that we are a highly leveraged operating model for the company, if you look at the first half of this year, more than 50% of total revenue growth fell to the bottom line. We see the opportunity in cloud to be a fast growing high gross margin opportunity. And we are going to invest to capture that. But we are doing so while continuing to drive the operating margin profile of the total company. So I'm excited about possibilities ahead and the continued increase in margin rich software and cloud services in our portfolio. Mike, you have anything else? Yes, certainly, we have three ways that we drive success in the cloud business. The first is technology certification and workload expansion. So we work with the cloud providers to qualify more and more and more workloads that can be best served using our technology. An example that I cited recently is the VMware, cloud in Google, now being certified to use NetApp Cloud Volumes as the primary as a primary data store, which has enormous benefits to VMware customers of NetApp and VMware to be able to now expand to the cloud as well as new customers that want to deploy mission critical environments on the VMware Cloud, right. So that's one. Workload certifications and expansions, the second is additional regions, and enablement for the go-to-market engines. You've seen us grow the Azure NetApp files business steadily and very successfully over a period of time. Amazon and Google are behind that. But we know the recipe and we're working to scale that. And then finally, cross-selling and upselling and customer wants to get on our service. Dollar based net retention rate is a very healthy 179%. It's early days in our customer base. So over time, that should come down. But it shows that once a customer uses one of our services, they expand dramatically, and then we get to sell them a portfolio of more services. So lots of ways to grow our cloud business ahead. We're super excited. And we worked really, really hard to get here and we're going to capitalize on the opportunity. Yes, absolutely. I think we have said for a long time, that mid range systems with clustering software, will cannibalize the high-end free memory business of some of our competitors. And you're seeing that play out. The mid range systems offer the sweet spot from a price performance standpoint for our customers. And with clustering, you can build enormously large environments to consolidate a range of different workloads. And we expect that trend to continue going forward, the days of the free [indiscernible] are over to be completely transparent. And so we'll continue to see that trend going on over time. With regard to how these -- within our business, All-flash arrays will have an important and growing part of the customers data center. Hybrid Flash arrays will continue to have a long-term position in the data center. So today in our installed base, for example, all flash is about a 30% of the installed base. We expect as more flash technologies come to play that number to grow to about 70% over time. I think, however, we do not subscribe to the theory that hard disk drives no longer have value, they will have enduring value for certain sets of workloads that they are built for capacity oriented workloads, backup and archival, media retention, images, things like that. So we feel good about our position in the market. We're going to stay focused and continue to execute against our All-flash array business and our object storage businesses priorities for the enterprise storage environment. Thank you. We see continuing trends for digital transformation, hybrid work and hybrid IT, those have been our long-term perspective on how business architectures and technology architectures evolve. That has certainly come sharper into focus with COVID. But they have always been part of the long-term roadmap of our customers. We have seen the acceleration of cloud-based environments for certain workloads, especially workloads, like virtual desktops, or in schools for the ability for teachers to be able to use cloud based environments to conduct classrooms, and we think those will continue on and you're going forward, as the future of work remains hybrid. Within the enterprise storage environments, we've always believed that flash will have a growing part of the customer data center, as the economics of flash and the ability to consolidate and simplify your data center environment grows. That being said, there are workloads like I've mentioned earlier in the call that will continue to stay on hard drives. And I think the big early draft to flash is now sort of stabilizing and people understand what flash is going to be used for, and understand what HDDs are going to be used for. And so we see a more steady pattern there. With regard to, lead times and transactions and things like that, as Mike mentioned, we didn't see anything unusual. We have been able to meet customers through a variety of mechanisms, digital conferences, using video conferencing mechanisms, as well as now starting to meet some customers in person. And so we expect that to continue going forward for a period of time, at least. Thank you. Thank you. Sure. So thanks, Nehal and hello. So as we talked about in Q1, billings grew by about 20%. In Q2 billings grew by about 7%. Keep in mind that so on a -- on a year-to-date basis, right around 12% to 13% growth, that number is going to jump around a little bit each quarter based on the dynamics of deferred revenue, as well as FX as well. So we calculate billings as net revenue in the quarter and then quarter-over-quarter change in deferred excluding the impact of FX in deferred. So that's going to move the numbers a little bit, there's a little bit of seasonality to that. So looking forward, we would expect to continue to see billings overall grow at or above the revenue number. And again, I would encourage you -- and take a look at the year-to-date number or the trailing 12 months. Billings will jump around a little bit based on the components of our billings, mix matters as well as seasonality. Thank you. Q4 is the finish of our fiscal year, as you might know, we run a semi-annual plan. And so, we had a strong Q2, and we'll have a strong Q4. So that reflects the seasonality in our business, driven by our compensation planning, as well as customer buying through the year. I think with regard to margins, I'll have Mike cover that. In terms of the supply chain and the margin profile, I would just tell you, we do not expect the near-term resolution of the supply situation. What we have seen through excellent execution with our teams and our partners is that component costs for the full year are largely flat year-on-year . There are some elements of the components that are up year-on-year and others that are down year-on-year, but as we have said before, component costs are largely flat on a year-on-year basis. I think what we see is really the expedite and freight costs that are at a premium now, and that is reflected in the pricing left that we have implemented at the start of November, and which will take some time to flow through our systems. I will let Mike characterize. Thank you. Listen, I think first of all, AWS and Azure have enormous scale and reach into the customer base. These are trillion dollar corporations with enormous impact on the IT market. And we are honored to work with both of them. They have different approaches to the customer base and different ways and different strengths. And so we're excited to work with Amazon and Microsoft. I think the overall opportunity set reflects their scale in the market, right. So Amazon has massive market presence and market share. I think in the file space, they are a very large part of the files market. So the fact that we have a play with them gives us enormous scale into the file storage market. I think, we are from an execution standpoint, listen, we've learned a lot over the last few years. We know what it takes to scale a business. And we've done that in partnership with Microsoft. We continue to scale that with innovation and co-engineering and go-to-market. But we are also taking some of those lessons learned into how we can scale other services more quickly. With regard to the $1 billion plants, listen, we always believed that we would be working with multiple hyperscalars. I don't think you should assume that we were cocky enough to say that we had that in the bag. But we had that as part of our roadmap and we're honored to have the partnership with AWS. I think, as I said, I feel very, very good about where we are in our roadmap to a $1 billion. We'll tell you more about the timing and the mix and all of that when we get to Analysts Date, right, but I feel really good about where we are. So a great, great question. So as we've talked about for the last couple years is our goal is to continue to invest in the business to drive growth. Being fully cognizant of investing in operating expense and COGS at a lower rate than revenue to drive a margins. You saw an incredible really operating leverage so far this year. And if you take the midpoint of the guide, your revenue is up almost $550 million year-over-year, on a $118 million or $120 million, pick your favorite number, OpEx number. So we're continuing to drive really good scale while investing in the business. We will continue to do that going forward, very much focused not only on where we need to invest, but what does that return. That's why we're so focused on cloud as well as incremental sales and product development. So you should expect to see us continue to invest going forward. Now outside of OpEx, we've talked about it before, we will continue to be active in M&A. And we're still allocating at least 30% of our free cash flow. Plus, we have a very nice cash balance and a lot of flexibility on the balance sheet to fund acquisitions. So, yes, you should expect to see us continue to increase OpEx to drive growth, as well as be active in the M&A market. And doesn't that sound like fun? That's exactly what we're focused on. Thank you. Yes, great, great questions. So as you look at the rest of this fiscal year, and I'll work it into next year, you shouldn't really expect to see much of a benefit in Q3. There's a lot of cones in flight, it takes a while for that to take effect. So we expect to start to see some of that in Q4. As we roll into '23, I think it depends on a lot of things. The earlier question on what are your competitors doing? What's the overall pricing environment? What happens with component costs and freight? I think there's a lot in that for us to be able to say, hey, we think X amount sticks. Certainly we are very disciplined around our pricing. And we want to ensure that we are doing the right things for our customers, while we are taking care of covering our costs as well. So we'll be very focused on it. We'll talk to you as we guide to next year on the impact of that. But I did want to be clear just on the impact of '22. Thank you. We have delivered a solid first half with great operating leverage in our business model as we grow revenues and margins. We're gaining share in the key markets of All-flash and Object Storage, while rapidly scaling our Public Cloud business. The innovation we bring to market and our unique and deep cloud partnerships, position us well to execute again, the significant opportunity ahead. We increased our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and Public Cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year. Thank you. I look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter and at our upcoming Investor Day in March."

I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon. And thanks to everyone for joining our Q1 fiscal year '22 earnings call. Building on our accelerating momentum through fiscal year 21, we delivered a strong start to fiscal year 22 with results at the high-end or above our guidance for Q1. Broad-based strength drove 12% revenue growth and 16% product revenue growth year-over-year.  Public cloud revenue grew triple-digits again this quarter up 155% from Q1 a year ago. Our results reflect solid customer demand and strong execution by our team in the quarter. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives remain top customer priorities, and we continue to benefit from these sizable long-term trends.  Customers need to simplify and modernize existing data centers and deploy traditional applications quickly and confidently. At the same time, customers are also accelerating their use of cloud, adopting modern application architectures like Kubernetes and micro-services for new workloads and deploying data-rich applications, like machine and deep learning.  With our data fabric strategy, we are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' most significant challenges in both modern and traditional applications on-premises and in hybrid multi-cloud environments. As I've said many times, our public cloud services not only allow us to participate in the rapidly growing cloud market, they also make us a more strategic data center partner to our enterprise customers, driving share gains in our hybrid cloud business.  In Q1, we introduced our new segment reporting disclosures for hybrid cloud and public cloud, corresponding with how I look at our business. We provided financial information for both segments in our earnings materials to give you better insight into the dynamics of the 2 segments.  We will maintain our focus on driving growth with our hybrid cloud portfolio while scaling our public cloud services in fiscal year '22. In Q1, hybrid cloud revenue grew 8% year-over-year, led by outstanding growth in our All-Flash-Array business, which increased 23% to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. Based on our strong revenue growth, I am confident that we again gained share in the storage and all-flash markets.  In the quarter, we delivered significant innovation that advances our flexible foundation for hybrid cloud, unified data management across on-premises and cloud environments. And simplifies the consumption and operation of hybrid cloud services. We further enhance the industry's leading and only cloud-ready storage operating system by introducing ONTAP 9.9, with security enhancements, new integrated data protection capabilities, and improved stamp performance.  We also released storage grid 11.5, which supports for data encryption using external key management, ransomware protection with S3 object locks, and increased performance with intelligent load balancing. And we announced a broad range of enhancements to Keystone flex subscription with new features for service providers, additional cloud support, a partner-delivered FlexPod as a service, and integration with Equinix colocation services.  Public cloud revenue grew 155% year-over-year, driven by Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights, and Spot by NetApp. It's been a year since we acquired Spot. And we are excited by the innovation we've brought to market under the Spot by NetApp brand. And the momentum we have with the spot offerings.  Public cloud ARR grew to $337 million, an increase of 89% year-over-year and public cloud dollar-based net retention rate remains healthy at 192%. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and growing. I am honored that we were recognized by Microsoft as the winner of their global customer experience partner of the year, and of their U.S. SAP on Azure Partner of the Year award.  We continue to broaden our public cloud services beyond storage and data management services. Today, we have customers extend, migrate, automate, and optimize the infrastructure, and data management capabilities for enterprise and cloud-native applications. Customers use NetApp public cloud services because we enabled them to use more Cloud at less cost. In Q1, we announced Spot PC, a fully managed, secure, and cost-effective Cloud desktop as a service for Azure virtual desktop, and Windows 365.  Additionally, we acquired Data Mechanics to accelerate the roadmap for spot wave, infrastructure and application, automation and optimization platform for high-growth, big data, and machine learning workloads in the Cloud. We also continue to deliver on our vision and strategy around application-aware infrastructure and data management for containers.  Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability with the optimal blend of spot reserved and on-demand compute instances reducing costs by up to 90%. In Q1, we evolve Spot Ocean into a suite of DevOps solutions. with Ocean Continuous Delivery and Ocean Insights. Ocean Continuous Delivery focuses on the most painful aspects of modern application delivery by automating mission-critical deployment in verification processes.  Ocean Insights is an analytical tool that gives users a full view of their application clusters and then previews the potential savings from Ocean. Last year, we introduced Astra Control, a rich set of storage and application-aware, data management services for cloud-based Kubernetes workloads. Astra extends the data fabric to the cloud-native world. And in Q1, we extended Astra to be a deployable on-premises software solution, Astra Control Center.  Wherever a customer chooses to deploy Kubernetes applications, we can accelerate the deployment, operation, and protection of these critical environments. Let me share with you a customer story to highlight the value Astra Control Center brings to enterprise customers. As a part of its transformation strategy, a leading telecommunications provider is using a modern IT architecture based on container-native applications.  These workloads are mission-critical and the customer turned to NetApp and Astra Control Center to address the challenges of data protection and disaster recovery that don't exist in the Kubernetes natively. Additionally, Astra helped them realize their vision of application portability across multiple Kubernetes distributions, and data sharing across multiple clusters. We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise storage and data management technology.  Our public cloud services drive further differentiation, expand our addressable market, and enable us to reach new customers. We deliver not only industry-leading storage services in the cloud, but also cloud automation and optimization services, and cloud infrastructure monitoring services.  You should expect us to capitalize on our advantage by enhancing our go-to-market activities, deepening our cloud partnerships, and delivering best-in-class, organic and inorganic innovations. Our strong customer momentum and the uniqueness of our public cloud services position furthers my confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal year \u201825.  Our strong first-quarter results underscore our value to customers in a hybrid multi-cloud, data-driven digital world. We are confident that we are well-positioned with the right portfolio and strategy to solve our customers' most pressing challenges. With focused execution and demonstrated leadership in hybrid multi-cloud, we are reshaping the industry.  We made a number of innovation announcements this quarter, and we will continue to bring industry-leading capabilities to market, further enhancing our differentiated position in Cloud and software. I am excited for what this year will bring. And I'm confident in our ability to deliver top-line growth as we support our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys.  Before I turn the call over to Mike to walk through our financial results and expectations, I want to thank the NetApp team, our customers, and our partners for an outstanding quarter. I also want to remind you that we'll be hosting our fully Digital Insight customer event in October. I hope you'll be able to join us. With that, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non - GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Fiscal '22 is off to a great start with strong revenue, gross margin, and operating leverage across the entire business. Excellent execution by the whole NetApp team yielded Q1 billings of $1.38 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.46 billion up 12% year-over-year.  Our solid Q1 results were driven by healthy demand across both our hybrid cloud and public cloud segments. Gross margin, operating margin, and EPS all came in above the high-end of guidance. As George noted in our earnings materials today, we introduced our new segment reporting disclosures for both hybrid cloud and public cloud.  Hybrid cloud captures all the revenue streams from our enterprise data center business, which include product support and professional services. Our public cloud segment provides incremental visibility into the revenue and gross margin profile of our rapidly growing Cloud business.  Total hybrid cloud revenue of $1.38 billion was up 8% year-over-year. Within the hybrid cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, and expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal '22. Product revenue of $730 million increased 16% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we saw throughout fiscal '21, software products revenue of $414 million increased 33% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our All-Flash portfolio.  Totaled Q1 recurring support revenue was $578 million flat year-over-year, excluding the 14th week from last year's compare, recurring support revenue was up 8% year-over-year. As George highlighted, public cloud ARR exited one at $337 million up 89% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Public cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $79 million up 155% year-over-year. The growing scale of our public cloud platform continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp delivering four of the 12 points in revenue growth.  When combined, software revenue, recurring support, and public cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 17% year-over-year, representing 73% of total revenue, versus 71% in Q1 21. Recurring support and public cloud revenue of $657 million was up 8% year-over-year, constituting 45% of total revenue. Excluding last year's 14th week from the comparison, recurring support and public cloud revenue were up a healthy 16% year-over-year. We ended Q1 with over $3.9 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 8% year-over-year.  Q1 marks the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which continues to be the best indicator of the health of our recurring revenue. The total gross margin of 69% was an all-time Company high, reflecting the value of our software portfolio and public cloud platform. The total hybrid cloud gross margin was also 69% in Q1. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, the product gross margin was 55% and benefited from the continued mix shift towards software-rich All-Flash systems.  Our recurring support business continues to be very profitable with a gross margin of 92%. The public cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. This is a major milestone for the public cloud business as we continue to build out a diversified portfolio of cloud-based software offerings, we expect this trend to continue as an increasing percentage of our public cloud business is built on software-only solutions.  Q1 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model with an operating margin of 23%, an all-time high for our Q1. EPS of $1.15 came in above the high end of guidance and was up 58% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $242 million, and free cash flow was $191 million. During Q1, we repurchased $100 million in stock and paid out a $112 million in cash dividend. In total, we returned $212 million to shareholders representing 111% of free cash flow. We closed Q1 with $4.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.  As you all know, the supply chain situation remains fluent. Our excellent supply chain and procurement team continues to work closely with our partner ecosystem with the goal of keeping backlog and customer lead times at a normal level. Towards this goal, we will continue to invest incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments to help mitigate any potential supply risks.  Aiding this effort is the fact that we have a singular software platform that powers all of our key storage products, which provides us added flexibility to work with our contract manufacturers and customers to meet and demand. With our strong execution in Q1 and our expectation of continued growth for the remainder of the year. We are raising our fiscal '22 guidance across the board.  We now expect revenues to grow 8% to 9% year-over-year with billings growth expected to outpace revenue growth, given the continued strength and recurring support contracts and our public cloud platform. We also have growing confidence in our public cloud opportunity and are raising the low end of our fiscal 22 guides.  We now expect to exit fiscal 22 with a public cloud ARR of 450 to $500 million driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships, and continued product innovation. As George noted, we are solidly on track to deliver on our commitment to eclipsed $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal '25. In fiscal '22, we expect the total gross margin to be approximately 68%, with a product margin of approximately 55% for the full year. We anticipate the operating margin to range between 23 to 24%.  Operating expense expectations remain unchanged at 2.75 to $2.8 billion, driven by continued investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our public cloud portfolio, targeted investments in go-to-market resources, and continued investment in our customer success sales team. As we discussed at our Investor Day last September, we continue to grow revenue faster than operating expenses. We are committed to delivering $4.85 to $5.05 in fiscal '22 EPS, representing 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.  Implied in this guidance is our expectation that other income and expenses will be a negative $60 million to $65 million and our effective tax rate will remain at 19%. We now expect to generate more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22 as our hybrid cloud business continues to fund the growth in our public cloud platform. We are committed to the capital allocation framework we outlined during our Q4 call.  The dividend will remain the first call on capital while share repurchases will continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. In fiscal '22, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, we expect the share count to remain flat at 229 million shares exiting fiscal 22. Consistent with NetApp's long history of discipline M and A, the remaining free cash flow generation will go towards our acquisition strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic public cloud roadmap.  Now on the Q2 guidance, we expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.49 billion and $1.59 and $1.59 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 9% increase year-over-year. We expect the consolidated gross margin to be approximately 68% and the operating margin to be approximately 23%. assumed in this guidance, our Q2 operating expenses of 690 to $700 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 19% and we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $1.1 and $1.24 per share.  Assumed in our Q2 guidance is our expectation that other income and expenses will be a negative $15 million to $20 million. As a reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow. This is further compounded by the one-time tax payment associated with the sale of our Sunnyvale campus. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for working tirelessly throughout Q1 to maintain the momentum we had exiting last year.  We are at a unique inflection point in the Company's history as we continue to build out a truly differentiated public cloud platform while maintaining an unwavering focus on the hybrid cloud business. As a result, we are more confident than ever in our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, customers, and partners as we execute against both opportunities. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Let's open the call for Q&A. Please keep to just one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKaty Huberty: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter, especially the cloud profitability milestone. I have a question on the Cloud business. Last quarter you emphasized the seasonality that you expect in this business, weaker 1Q, 3Q, and stronger 2Q, 4Q seasonality.  I just wanted to confirm that that would imply in your second quarter that you would expect in ARR sequential increase that's greater than what you just posted for the July quarter. And then just to add color to that, any shift in the sources of Cloud ARR and revenue in terms of your different cloud offerings or the different public cloud platforms that are driving the growth. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Hey, Kate. It's Mike. Thanks for the question. I will take the first one and George will jump in on the second one. So, we would expect the same seasonality we discussed last time a little bit more in Q2 and in Q4 on a sequential basis. That's really driven by our, as you know, our bi-annual sales plan that we have now, so yes, correct. We would expect sequential to be a little bit higher in Q2.\nGeorge Kurian: I think with regard to the second question, you had Katy with a mix of offerings, we feel really good about Spot by NetApp, and the work that we're doing with the hyperscalers, both especially Microsoft and Google were strong in the quarter. I think the seasonality reflected in, as we had said, reflected in the offerings that were sold by NetApp they grew nicely, but not as much as the hyperscalers than Spot did.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: Yeah. Thank you. The first question on the public cloud growth, revenue ARR, how much of that was organic?\nMike Berry: Sorry, if you -- it's Mike. If you look at the revenue growth it was a 155% year-over-year growth. If you exclude the acquisitions, then we're still very strong at about 138%. So super strong.\nJason Ader: Great. And you had Spot in the numbers last year, correct? Last Q1.\nMike Berry: Great question. We only had Spot for less than a month. We closed that --\nJason Ader: Less than a month, okay.\nMike Berry: -- Early July, so it was very little in Q1 last year.\nJason Ader: Okay. All right. So Q2 will be kind of apples-to-apples that was Spot.\nMike Berry: Yeah, you're going to get a full quarter in each --\nJason Ader: Okay.\nMike Berry: -- In Q2 this year.\nJason Ader: All right. And then George, on the growth on the product side, how much do you think is coming from pent-up demand as the economy started to reopen here over the last several months, 6 months or so. And then what type of sustainable revenue growth do you think is reasonable? Beyond this year where you know, there are some I guess easier comps?\nGeorge Kurian: And so, I think that we have never signaled of V-shaped snapback or anything like that. Our belief has been that other than a small number of customers who were directly impacted by COVID, the vast majority of the customers that we've worked with had a steady demand pattern for several quarters now, certainly, we are seeing strengthening in demand as the economies reopen.  But this is a reflection of more long-term trends, transformational work that customers are doing to digitize or hybridize their business, the work that they're doing to build cloud environments, and so on.  So, I don't think that we see this as a pent-up demand kind of model. I think with regard to the sustainability of our business, we feel really good about product revenue. We -- as we said, we think that we can sustain product revenue growth each of the quarters of this year.  And particularly our Flash segment is very, very strong. And so, we see really good momentum there. And no reason to feel anything but real good confidence about where we are. Listen, we just finished a phenomenal quarter. In Q1, we grew our all-flash business by 23% overall product revenue by 16%, and cloud by 155% year-on-year.  We raised our fiscal year to 8% to 9% growth and anticipate delivering close to $5 in earnings per share. These are all record numbers, operating margins full year, and earnings per share for the Company. I feel very, very good about where we are.\nJason Ader: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Thanks for taking the question. I guess kind of two related questions if I can. First of all, is the kind of industry we've seen a lot of evidence of component constraints and inflationary component pricing dynamics.  As you've seen that. How do you believe your customers have behaved as far as putting orders in place? How has your lead times may be changed with relation to that or has that not been a factor and you don't believe that will be a risk factor as we move forward?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think that components being constrained and the supply base being dynamic and fluid is something that everybody in the industry faces. Our team has done an excellent job, and the fact that we have a single operating system and a single architecture for the vast majority of our revenue gives us the flexibility to adapt and react in real-time to potential supply constraints.  Both the gross margin guide and the revenue guide that we've given anticipate puts and takes across the supply chain. With regard to our ability to manage pricing in an inflationary environment, I think the product gross margin strength in Q1 and the outlook for Q2 remains strong and is a reflection of the discipline in our field organization.  With regard to do I see customers buying up products ahead of scheduled to deal with supply constraints. I don't see that, maybe there are occasional anecdote situations. But the vast majority as we've said, it's a pretty steady and strong demand pattern across a broad range of deals. You see that in our results this quarter. Mike, do you want to add anything?\nMike Berry: No, as George talked about, it's obviously very fluid. I would just give another shout-out to not only our team but obviously our partners as well for all the work that goes on, they had a really good quarter and we expect them to continue to perform and help us get through this as everybody in the industry faces.\nAaron Rakers: That's perfect guys, congrats. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot, and thanks for taking my question. I just have one, I guess. George really impressive set of numbers across the board and you took up your ARR estimates for the year by 25 million at the end. I'd love to just understand what is giving you the confidence to raise the guide this early in the year? Is it better sales execution, go-to-market, or are you just seeing better adoption as a cloud company?  Just help me understand what's driving the confidence to uplift the guide for fiscal '22 on cloud services. And then Mike, relating to that, you achieved that in a gross margin number of cloud services a lot quicker than you may have had. How does the rest of the year look like from a cloud gross margin perspective?\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to our confidence in the cloud business, I think we feel very, very good about the portfolio that we have. It serves a broader and broader range of used cases, both traditional applications, as well as net-new applications. Second, we are adding a lot of customers, both through NetApp pathways and particularly the hyperscaler pathways.  Third, once a customer joins our platform, as you can see from our dollar-based net retention rate, they expand quite substantially with NetApp. They like the portfolio when they do a lot more with us. I think those three key fundamentals of the business drive my confidence in being able to take up the bottom of the range to this early in the year.\nMike Berry: And then on the gross margin, questions are great questions. If you remember back in September Amit we talked about, there are really 4 things that we think will drive increased gross margins in the public cloud business. And it was revenue scale and we've certainly exceeded our expectations. There's increased hardware utilization.  The team's doing a wonderful job making sure as we deploy that hardware that we drive utilization. Remember as well ONTAP drives everything here at NetApp on-prem, as well as in the cloud, and we continue to see great improvements there. And the one that I think is underappreciated is more software. Keep in mind that of the 4 major products in that portfolio Cloud Volumes Services, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Cloud Insights, and Spot, only services is \u2013 call it hardware dependent. The other three are all software Cloud offerings, and they've grown all very nicely, which has helped us get to where we are from a margin perspective. Thanks for that. And then, hey, Jason, just so I can sleep at night. I gave you 138, -- it was 135, still a very good number on the organic revenue growth if you exclude all acquisitions. Thank you for that question.\nAmit Daryanani: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRod Hall: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I will just come back to these product gross margins and just try to check. I mean, you beat your guide substantially, beat our expectations substantially for total gross margin, I should say.  But also, the product is over 2 points better than what we anticipated. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what the surprise was there. I mean, what was different and what may be what you were thinking last quarter and then I've got a follow-up on that?\nMike Berry: Sure, Rob, its Mike, so I think there were two things that really drove that performance. And the first one was the large majority of which was to grow and All-Flash. And that going from, I believe it was 11% year-over-year growth last year to 23.  And you know, that comes with much better margins, more software rich, mix matters as well in that business as we've talked about in the past. The other thing that helps the percentage as well as pay -- as you know, we de-prioritized things like HCI last year. Those come in at lower margin percentages. So, you add those 2 together and that's really what drove the higher gross -- product gross margin number.\nRod Hall: Okay. That's great Mike it's helped a lot. I wanted to also ask about cash flow and seasonality. I know you -- I think I heard you call out that next quarter should be a low point for cash flow and then you've given us a full-year guide on cash flow.  I'm just curious like, what is pushing all that cash flow of the backend of the year? Is it I mean, I see quite a bit of compensation accrual, but I'm just curious why the flow of cash looks the way that it does this particular year? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Sure. Love cash flow questions, happy to answer those any time. In Q1, if you look at the balance, you see that accrued expenses were done significantly and that that's when a lot of variable pay gets paid in Q1.  In Q2, cash flows are largely going to follow billings growth from an aggregate perspective. Q1 from a total dollar\u2019s perspective is our lowest billings. That then flows into lower collections in Q2 as well. That's -- the other big mover there is cash taxes, and I highlighted that. Keep in mind, we'll pay about 40 million in state and federal taxes on the Sunnyvale campus.  Then in the second half, as we build billings, that's when collections go up. Every [Indiscernible] has largely relatively similar. The big movers are seasonality of collections, variable pay timing, and then cash taxes.\nRod Hall: Great. And what you say is a big thing on a year-to-year, it's just that sale of the headquarters last year which positively impacted cash flow quite a bit, right?\nMike Berry: That, yeah -- and keep in mind that it helped cash balances, it didn't go into operating cash flow of [Indiscernible], right.\nRod Hall: Okay. Great. Thanks very much, Mike. Helpful.\nMike Berry: Absolutely. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMatt Cabral: Yes. Thank you very much. Sounds like the demand environment continues to pick up. Curious what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint as that demand has improved, whether it's discounting your pricing and just what you're seeing in terms of the broader environment at this point.\nMike Berry: I think we see, as I cited my prepared remarks, solid steady demand across all the geos. I think all of our geographies have executed extremely well to capture that demand. I feel very good about the differentiation in our offerings, both on-premises as well as in the public cloud that gives us a chance to drive value conversations with customers.  Our public cloud services clearly help our on-premises hybrid cloud business because customers see us as the only storage vendor with a cloud already operating system and that's for them to get to the public cloud. And the combination of those two is allowing us to bring on new customers and to be able to maintain and differentiated value proposition in the market. Very good execution by the team against steady solid demand across all geographies.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one on operating margins. You're guiding to 23 to 24 for the full year. That's about 300 basis points expansion. But if we start to look beyond this fiscal year, how should we think about headroom on margins?  I know you referred to OpEx leverage a couple of times in your prepared remarks, but just trying to think about kind of the magnitude of margin expansion beyond this fiscal year, and the drivers between gross margin and OpEx leverage. How should we think about the balance of that?\nGeorge Kurian: I think overall, as we said, we continue to be a disciplined management team in the way we run the business. You should expect, as you see in the numbers this year that we should grow topline ahead of expenses, and that should create leverage in the model.  I think as Mike outlined, we wanted to get to 55 points of product gross margins in the hybrid cloud business, we have achieved that and we want to maintain that for the rest of this year. And then in terms of public cloud, we said that we wanted to get it to be accretive to the margin structure of the core business, which it is.  And we weren't -- we have expectations to continue to improve that over time towards a more SaaS-like gross margin model. Both of those elements top line as well as gross margin should allow us to be kind of creating leverage in the operating margin model of the Company. Mike, do you want to add anything?\nMike Berry: No. Well, put. Those are the puts and.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is open.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, thank you. Your all-flash array portfolio grew 23% off a difficult comparison, and that only gets better in the second half from a comparison standpoint. So, it seems that that's driving the bulk of your upwardly revised fiscal '22 outlook for hardware.  But I'd love to hear what you are seeing from hybrid arrays across both commercial and even SMB environments because component providers would also suggest that area is also doing well too. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think hybrid arrays as we have consistently said, have a place in customer environments. There are a set of use cases we have consistently maintained that a hybrid array has a better solution to offer than an all-flash array.  And so, we continue to see an opportunity for hybrid arrays to have a go-forward, enduring place. And customer\u2019s environments are hybrid array business is a strong business. We have a differentiated value proposition in hybrid, just like we do in all-flash.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. George, you threw a lot at us on the public cloud side in your prepared remarks about the types of services you have today and where they're going. If we step back and you mentioned we have the near-term trends are going.  But if we step back and thought about the 2 to 3-year plan around what will be the dominant services then versus now. And what maybe isn't in the revenue base today. Can you just sort of put all of that in perspective for us, how it drives towards that $1 billion ARR target? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think we are in the early innings of enterprise use of Cloud for [Indiscernible] mission-critical, business-critical application. I think we see that over the next few years, as businesses deploy more of their core operations on public clouds.  The opportunities we have around compute, automation, and management through Spot storage and data protection and management through Cloud Volumes, and monitoring through Cloud Insights will be a very, very strong business.  And all of the hyperscaler partners that we work with see it much the same way, which is why they're building more and more capabilities with us. We also see a new growth engine in the public cloud segment.  You, all the cloud-native work we're doing around containers and some are less. So, Spot Ocean be mentioned, is the same value proposition that spot brings for enterprise applications to containerized applications. That is seeing very strong adoption.  We've worked with some of the hyperscalers around Astra Control, and we're starting to see that get to wrap, especially with new cloud-native Kubernetes applications. And then we have started work on Cloud Insights for Kubernetes to bring monitoring and management. I feel very good about the portfolio. There's a lot of organic innovation and Spot has proven to be a really stellar acquisition for the Company.\nSteven Fox: Thanks very much. Appreciate that color.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is open.\nNik Todorov: Thanks, and congrats on great results, guys. George, can you give us more color on your on-prem share gains? Can you talk about which segments of the market do you see the strongest momentum there? And also, if you can comment on -- your direct sales grew faster than you\u2019re indirect for the 5th quarter in a row. Is there any particular reason for that? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think with regard to where we see strength, I mean, this was a really balanced quarter across all the geographies. You can look at our results in the Americas, you look at the results in Europe and in Asia-Pacific, we grew in all the major geographies very, very nicely.  So, I feel very good about that. With regard to the direct versus indirect, I think it's a reflection of some of our largest customers who continue to buy direct, being a strong contributor to some of our all-flash array growth tried so I think that's sort of the puts and takes.  I wouldn't read anything into the specific quarter-on-quarter trends in the channel, like [Indiscernible] seek good opportunities to grow our business across both direct and indirect channels.\nNik Todorov: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I just wanted to dig a little bit more into the longer-term impact from obviously the shift to cloud, now that you are breaking it out. And I understand on the gross margin side, but I'm curious if there are SG&A and R&D differentials in terms of how you would allocate or how we think about it from an OpEx perspective?  And then the same on cash flow. I know it will be lumpy depending on the investments you need to support Cloud. But longer-term, how should we think about sort of the specific shift impacting the model? Thank you.\nMike Berry: I appreciate it, it's Mike. So, a couple of things as it relates to OpEx, keep in mind that the two largest operating expense lines, sales and marketing, and R&D, there's a lot of shared resources across there. Let's do R&D first, we've talked about it. We get a lot of efficiencies from the ONTAP group in terms of the work they do, both on-prem and in the cloud.  We would expect to continue that where they're focused on both of those, and we get a lot of efficiencies there. Clearly, most of the growth in that line has been focused around Cloud, and it probably still will be. That doesn't -- and that excludes any acquisitions that could certainly play into that as well.  And then from a sales and marketing perspective, we've now had at where our core sales team is selling both. And so that will continue to be a focus, but we will also add like our customer success team that we've talked about that's largely focused on the cloud business in terms of expansion and upsell and cross-sell to that team.  I think over time you'll continue to see that investment there from a cash flow perspective, I think that probably largely follows where operating income would if you're down to free cash flow, you get a little bit of difference in.  From the hardware. But we've also talked about the next couple of years will continue to see good, better hardware, especially as it relates to Azure. But over the next couple of years that will flatten out.  It's much more of a -- hey, we're adding in a certain location versus [Indiscernible] it. Once you get to almost 100% then it's more of a replacement motion. So those are the puts-and-takes around OpEx and cash flow for those 2 segments.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you. And the additional colors in detail were greatly appreciated. The upside for this quarter, was it due to mostly volumes or better pricing? And if the answer is both, can you kind of help us to say it was a little bit more of one versus the other. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Hey, Jim, it's Mike. It was largely related to volumes. We haven't seen much of a change in external pricing for -- as we've talked about competitive environment has always been competitive, but relatively similar.  So, it's largely going to move with volumes. We saw, we didn't see much of a mixing shaft. We've talked about that in previous quarters, so it was all relatively consistent, mostly driven by buoyancy.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much and congratulations and we appreciate the details.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital? Your line is open.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay. Thank you. Hey, George, when we look back to 2018, it was a very strong year. When we get to 2022, and I'm referring to spending broadly on capital equipment for data centers. When we get to 2022 will be at the four-year anniversary.  Not necessarily looking at guidance and maybe it's obviously a little bit early to ask that question. But keep the macro and the last cycle and that we had a couple of down years and '20, can you see that enterprise and commercial customers or hopefully coming strongly back to the market in 2022?\nGeorge Kurian: We have seen a steady consistent demand for our offerings and our capabilities for several quarters now. I want to just remind us that we had a strong year last year, particularly the second half of last year. And so, we continue to see that the overall demand environment is brightening steadily.  We have said from many quarters, we saw the U.S. and China leading the recovery. Europe a few months, 6 to 12 months behind that. And then the developing economies, maybe another 6 to 12 months beyond that, we continue to hold that perspective with the benefit of several quarters of experience.  And so, I feel very good. I think that we have customers who are seeing a better economic environment, starting to build confidence in spending on technology. I think within that segment, hybrid cloud, digital transformation initiatives are well-positioned and NetApp is well-positioned to go after that.\nLouis Miscioscia: Good. That's helpful. Thank you. Any comment on components availability and pricing obviously your margin structure has improved. So, congratulations on that. But what should we think about for the next six months there? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think as Mike and I said in prepared remarks, the component supply chain is a dynamic and slowing supply chain. It is well understood in the industry. Our team has done an excellent job managing through that. We have good deep relationships with suppliers and long-term commitments with many of them.  I think as Mike and I have suggested, we will continue to use cash to buy ahead of what we need so that we can maintain supply availability. You think that's a good use of cash in the current environment. And I think that having a single operating system that drives the vast majority of our business allows us to qualify and adapt to the environment that we're in.  I want to thank our supply chain teams for continued execution and our engineering team and our partners for working with us. And I think our Sales teams have done a really good job managing through the environment to capture the value that we should for our products.\nLouis Miscioscia: Good luck with the rest of the year.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. George, on the AFA site, can you give us an update on where you stand with respect to penetration of the installed base? And are you seeing any changes on the competitive side? And then one clarification for Mike too.\nGeorge Kurian: It's 29%, so it's up another percent. As we have said, consistently, our installed base continues to grow as we acquire new customers and new workloads. And Flash is penetrating that installed base and incremental 1% to 2% at a time, right?  So, a long runway ahead on that installed base. With regard to the competitive environment, again, we don't see any sort of substantive changes. I think we have a really good offering in the market.  I think we believe we have taken a share in the environment and we're going to continue to stay focused on winning not only 30, so workloads, but also new types of workloads like Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Data lakes, and others with our all-flash portfolio.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, thanks, George. And Mike, just a clarification on these product growth margins. I heard your commentary on better software mix, also discipline in the field. But was there any contribution from either new ELAs or renewal of prior ELAs that had any impact on margins in the quarter?\nMike Berry: So, thanks for the question Wamsi. So, as we've talked about, look, it's such a small piece of the business. We're not going to talk about ELAs, here's what I would point you to, and I've said it every quarter.  If you look at the financial results, specifically the amount of software and hardware revenue, you can see that in Q1 software increase, but sorted hardware, they've basically moved in lockstep the last four quarters. And if anything, if there are any large transactions that are different than our current mix, you will see it in the numbers.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nSimon Leopold: I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your methodology for forecasting the business, your public cloud compared to your hybrid Cloud. They're different animals, they're different maturity and I just want to understand how you're doing it and if you have some advice for the analyst community on what we can do to better enable our ability to forecast your public cloud trends. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Yeah. Hey Simon, it's Mike. I'll take that one. When we look at the public cloud business, certainly it is much -- it's -- it is similar to some of the hybrid cloud dynamics, I will talk about that in a second. There are certainly new transactions that we forecast, not only coming in from the hyperscalers.  But from our sales team as well, we got pipeline reports, we see what that looks like. So, we're able to forecast that more and more, it's also renewal rates, being able to forecast renewals and then really the big driver of all cloud software businesses up-sell, cross-sell. That's, obviously difficult for you folks to see those details.  But we\u2019ve looked at all of those, certainly sales capacity as part of that on the hybrid cloud business. Keep in mind, I think it's now $2.3 billion of support revenue every year. That's much more of a renewal rate. We do look at cross-selling, upsell, and we also look at where we are in terms of pipelines and conversion rates and a big piece for us is obviously, do we have enough sales capacity?  So, I know we get a lot of questions about a net absolute go quarter-on-quarter sequentially. I would just encourage you when you look at that sequential, keep in mind, hey, the last couple of years. Have been very different than the last 10.  And it makes it -- I understand it makes it a little bit difficult, but hopefully, when we get through this COVID environment and it gets back to normal, those are more relevant, I think now it's very difficult to use those sequential growths to try to forecast the business.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on the public cloud business. Obviously, you raised your target exit rate for this year, gross margin is already above the corporate average, it sounds like it's going to go higher given the software mix. You haven't talked too much about operating margins.  But should we think about this revenue stream will eventually get to above-corporate average levels. Is there a certain revenue target we should be thinking about when that happened, or is there a time element? What are some of the things that we should consider when we think about this business growth?\nMike Berry: Sidney, its Mike. Just to make sure I get the -- you're talking about operating profits for the public cloud segment. That's your question?\nSidney Ho: Correct.\nMike Berry: Okay. Yeah. I think the best way that I would encourage you to look at that is here's the great thing about the Cloud businesses. There is a lot of good comps out there that we look at all the time. And as we look at businesses that call it 250 million in ARR, as they grow to a billion.  There, you'd see not only a slight uptick in gross margin, but then obviously you see the dynamics of operating income. So, I would encourage you to take a look at some of those comparisons. We look at that a lot in terms of benchmarking our business largely went ends up happening is they turn cash-flow positive before they turn operating income because of again, the way they recognize revenue ratable.  So, I would encourage you to. We'll take a look at those and there's really no reason to believe, as we said today, that we wouldn't follow that comparable group as we march to $1 billion in ARR.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nAnanda Baruah: Hi, good afternoon, guys. Really appreciate you taking the question. I'd love to get your thoughts as you see. it's sort of more workloads shift to the cloud to what extent, if any, are you guys up to seeing a hardware benefit particularly and sort of like an on-prem hardware benefit as opposed to [Indiscernible] move workloads to the Cloud, particularly given your, software [Indiscernible]. Thanks a lot.\nGeorge Kurian: I think with regard to the work that we're doing in the public cloud, as Mike has mentioned, and I've said before, the vast majority of our solutions are software-based. And we scale that software out using clustering so that it can go faster by going wider to more computing demand.  With regard to certain traditional applications that are more scale-up applications like an [Indiscernible] or something like that that requires a scale-up platform to support it, that's where we used hardware. And I think the software that we have can be run on generic hardware for the broad range of used cases, or our proprietary, our own hardware, for the narrow, really specific application in this case.\nAnanda Baruah: Okay, got it. Yeah, thank you. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nNehal Chokshi: Thank you. And congrats on the strong results and nice seat, increasing rate of capital we'll return to shareholders as well. My question here is that sounds like the acceleration All-Flash-Array it was behind the acceleration of software product revenues, 33% year-over-year growth. Is that correct? And then, what do you see as a sustainable growth rate in product software?\nMike Berry: Yes. So, 33% increase in the software portion of product revenue. It's driven for the earlier question really by two things. One is the really nice growth in all-flash, but also less growth in HCI in some of the products that have less software and more hardware.  And I would expect if going forward, if we're talking about growth in product revenue, given the continued mix shift towards All-Flash, you should expect to see software -- the software portion grow faster than the total product portion.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. Well, will 20-plus percent growth in products software be viable?\nMike Berry: We're not going to guide to that other than to say it should grow faster than the total product number.\nNehal Chokshi: Understood. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you Nehal. I'm going to pass it back to George for some closing remarks.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. In closing, we delivered a great start to FY '22. And now very well positioned for continued growth throughout the year. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives. The remaining top customer priorities. And we continue to benefit from these sizable long-term trends.  Our hybrid cloud and public cloud offerings put NetApp in a unique position to address our customers' most pressing challenges. Our cloud and software intellectual property truly differentiate us. As a result, I'm more confident than ever in our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, customers, and partners. Thanks for joining us.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non - GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Fiscal '22 is off to a great start with strong revenue, gross margin, and operating leverage across the entire business. Excellent execution by the whole NetApp team yielded Q1 billings of $1.38 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.46 billion up 12% year-over-year.  Our solid Q1 results were driven by healthy demand across both our hybrid cloud and public cloud segments. Gross margin, operating margin, and EPS all came in above the high-end of guidance. As George noted in our earnings materials today, we introduced our new segment reporting disclosures for both hybrid cloud and public cloud.  Hybrid cloud captures all the revenue streams from our enterprise data center business, which include product support and professional services. Our public cloud segment provides incremental visibility into the revenue and gross margin profile of our rapidly growing Cloud business.  Total hybrid cloud revenue of $1.38 billion was up 8% year-over-year. Within the hybrid cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, and expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal '22. Product revenue of $730 million increased 16% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we saw throughout fiscal '21, software products revenue of $414 million increased 33% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our All-Flash portfolio.  Totaled Q1 recurring support revenue was $578 million flat year-over-year, excluding the 14th week from last year's compare, recurring support revenue was up 8% year-over-year. As George highlighted, public cloud ARR exited one at $337 million up 89% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Public cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $79 million up 155% year-over-year. The growing scale of our public cloud platform continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp delivering four of the 12 points in revenue growth.  When combined, software revenue, recurring support, and public cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 17% year-over-year, representing 73% of total revenue, versus 71% in Q1 21. Recurring support and public cloud revenue of $657 million was up 8% year-over-year, constituting 45% of total revenue. Excluding last year's 14th week from the comparison, recurring support and public cloud revenue were up a healthy 16% year-over-year. We ended Q1 with over $3.9 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 8% year-over-year.  Q1 marks the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which continues to be the best indicator of the health of our recurring revenue. The total gross margin of 69% was an all-time Company high, reflecting the value of our software portfolio and public cloud platform. The total hybrid cloud gross margin was also 69% in Q1. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, the product gross margin was 55% and benefited from the continued mix shift towards software-rich All-Flash systems.  Our recurring support business continues to be very profitable with a gross margin of 92%. The public cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. This is a major milestone for the public cloud business as we continue to build out a diversified portfolio of cloud-based software offerings, we expect this trend to continue as an increasing percentage of our public cloud business is built on software-only solutions.  Q1 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model with an operating margin of 23%, an all-time high for our Q1. EPS of $1.15 came in above the high end of guidance and was up 58% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $242 million, and free cash flow was $191 million. During Q1, we repurchased $100 million in stock and paid out a $112 million in cash dividend. In total, we returned $212 million to shareholders representing 111% of free cash flow. We closed Q1 with $4.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.  As you all know, the supply chain situation remains fluent. Our excellent supply chain and procurement team continues to work closely with our partner ecosystem with the goal of keeping backlog and customer lead times at a normal level. Towards this goal, we will continue to invest incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments to help mitigate any potential supply risks.  Aiding this effort is the fact that we have a singular software platform that powers all of our key storage products, which provides us added flexibility to work with our contract manufacturers and customers to meet and demand. With our strong execution in Q1 and our expectation of continued growth for the remainder of the year. We are raising our fiscal '22 guidance across the board.  We now expect revenues to grow 8% to 9% year-over-year with billings growth expected to outpace revenue growth, given the continued strength and recurring support contracts and our public cloud platform. We also have growing confidence in our public cloud opportunity and are raising the low end of our fiscal 22 guides.  We now expect to exit fiscal 22 with a public cloud ARR of 450 to $500 million driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships, and continued product innovation. As George noted, we are solidly on track to deliver on our commitment to eclipsed $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal '25. In fiscal '22, we expect the total gross margin to be approximately 68%, with a product margin of approximately 55% for the full year. We anticipate the operating margin to range between 23 to 24%.  Operating expense expectations remain unchanged at 2.75 to $2.8 billion, driven by continued investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our public cloud portfolio, targeted investments in go-to-market resources, and continued investment in our customer success sales team. As we discussed at our Investor Day last September, we continue to grow revenue faster than operating expenses. We are committed to delivering $4.85 to $5.05 in fiscal '22 EPS, representing 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.  Implied in this guidance is our expectation that other income and expenses will be a negative $60 million to $65 million and our effective tax rate will remain at 19%. We now expect to generate more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22 as our hybrid cloud business continues to fund the growth in our public cloud platform. We are committed to the capital allocation framework we outlined during our Q4 call.  The dividend will remain the first call on capital while share repurchases will continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. In fiscal '22, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, we expect the share count to remain flat at 229 million shares exiting fiscal 22. Consistent with NetApp's long history of discipline M and A, the remaining free cash flow generation will go towards our acquisition strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic public cloud roadmap.  Now on the Q2 guidance, we expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.49 billion and $1.59 and $1.59 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 9% increase year-over-year. We expect the consolidated gross margin to be approximately 68% and the operating margin to be approximately 23%. assumed in this guidance, our Q2 operating expenses of 690 to $700 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 19% and we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $1.1 and $1.24 per share.  Assumed in our Q2 guidance is our expectation that other income and expenses will be a negative $15 million to $20 million. As a reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow. This is further compounded by the one-time tax payment associated with the sale of our Sunnyvale campus. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for working tirelessly throughout Q1 to maintain the momentum we had exiting last year.  We are at a unique inflection point in the Company's history as we continue to build out a truly differentiated public cloud platform while maintaining an unwavering focus on the hybrid cloud business. As a result, we are more confident than ever in our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, customers, and partners as we execute against both opportunities. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Hey, Kate. It's Mike. Thanks for the question. I will take the first one and George will jump in on the second one. So, we would expect the same seasonality we discussed last time a little bit more in Q2 and in Q4 on a sequential basis. That's really driven by our, as you know, our bi-annual sales plan that we have now, so yes, correct. We would expect sequential to be a little bit higher in Q2. Sorry, if you -- it's Mike. If you look at the revenue growth it was a 155% year-over-year growth. If you exclude the acquisitions, then we're still very strong at about 138%. So super strong. Great question. We only had Spot for less than a month. We closed that -- -- Early July, so it was very little in Q1 last year. Yeah, you're going to get a full quarter in each -- -- In Q2 this year. No, as George talked about, it's obviously very fluid. I would just give another shout-out to not only our team but obviously our partners as well for all the work that goes on, they had a really good quarter and we expect them to continue to perform and help us get through this as everybody in the industry faces. And then on the gross margin, questions are great questions. If you remember back in September Amit we talked about, there are really 4 things that we think will drive increased gross margins in the public cloud business. And it was revenue scale and we've certainly exceeded our expectations. There's increased hardware utilization.  The team's doing a wonderful job making sure as we deploy that hardware that we drive utilization. Remember as well ONTAP drives everything here at NetApp on-prem, as well as in the cloud, and we continue to see great improvements there. And the one that I think is underappreciated is more software. Keep in mind that of the 4 major products in that portfolio Cloud Volumes Services, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Cloud Insights, and Spot, only services is \u2013 call it hardware dependent. The other three are all software Cloud offerings, and they've grown all very nicely, which has helped us get to where we are from a margin perspective. Thanks for that. And then, hey, Jason, just so I can sleep at night. I gave you 138, -- it was 135, still a very good number on the organic revenue growth if you exclude all acquisitions. Thank you for that question. Sure, Rob, its Mike, so I think there were two things that really drove that performance. And the first one was the large majority of which was to grow and All-Flash. And that going from, I believe it was 11% year-over-year growth last year to 23.  And you know, that comes with much better margins, more software rich, mix matters as well in that business as we've talked about in the past. The other thing that helps the percentage as well as pay -- as you know, we de-prioritized things like HCI last year. Those come in at lower margin percentages. So, you add those 2 together and that's really what drove the higher gross -- product gross margin number. Sure. Love cash flow questions, happy to answer those any time. In Q1, if you look at the balance, you see that accrued expenses were done significantly and that that's when a lot of variable pay gets paid in Q1.  In Q2, cash flows are largely going to follow billings growth from an aggregate perspective. Q1 from a total dollar's perspective is our lowest billings. That then flows into lower collections in Q2 as well. That's -- the other big mover there is cash taxes, and I highlighted that. Keep in mind, we'll pay about 40 million in state and federal taxes on the Sunnyvale campus.  Then in the second half, as we build billings, that's when collections go up. Every [Indiscernible] has largely relatively similar. The big movers are seasonality of collections, variable pay timing, and then cash taxes. That, yeah -- and keep in mind that it helped cash balances, it didn't go into operating cash flow of [Indiscernible], right. Absolutely. Thank you. I think we see, as I cited my prepared remarks, solid steady demand across all the geos. I think all of our geographies have executed extremely well to capture that demand. I feel very good about the differentiation in our offerings, both on-premises as well as in the public cloud that gives us a chance to drive value conversations with customers.  Our public cloud services clearly help our on-premises hybrid cloud business because customers see us as the only storage vendor with a cloud already operating system and that's for them to get to the public cloud. And the combination of those two is allowing us to bring on new customers and to be able to maintain and differentiated value proposition in the market. Very good execution by the team against steady solid demand across all geographies. No. Well, put. Those are the puts and. I appreciate it, it's Mike. So, a couple of things as it relates to OpEx, keep in mind that the two largest operating expense lines, sales and marketing, and R&D, there's a lot of shared resources across there. Let's do R&D first, we've talked about it. We get a lot of efficiencies from the ONTAP group in terms of the work they do, both on-prem and in the cloud.  We would expect to continue that where they're focused on both of those, and we get a lot of efficiencies there. Clearly, most of the growth in that line has been focused around Cloud, and it probably still will be. That doesn't -- and that excludes any acquisitions that could certainly play into that as well.  And then from a sales and marketing perspective, we've now had at where our core sales team is selling both. And so that will continue to be a focus, but we will also add like our customer success team that we've talked about that's largely focused on the cloud business in terms of expansion and upsell and cross-sell to that team.  I think over time you'll continue to see that investment there from a cash flow perspective, I think that probably largely follows where operating income would if you're down to free cash flow, you get a little bit of difference in.  From the hardware. But we've also talked about the next couple of years will continue to see good, better hardware, especially as it relates to Azure. But over the next couple of years that will flatten out.  It's much more of a -- hey, we're adding in a certain location versus [Indiscernible] it. Once you get to almost 100% then it's more of a replacement motion. So those are the puts-and-takes around OpEx and cash flow for those 2 segments. Hey, Jim, it's Mike. It was largely related to volumes. We haven't seen much of a change in external pricing for -- as we've talked about competitive environment has always been competitive, but relatively similar.  So, it's largely going to move with volumes. We saw, we didn't see much of a mixing shaft. We've talked about that in previous quarters, so it was all relatively consistent, mostly driven by buoyancy. Thank you. So, thanks for the question Wamsi. So, as we've talked about, look, it's such a small piece of the business. We're not going to talk about ELAs, here's what I would point you to, and I've said it every quarter.  If you look at the financial results, specifically the amount of software and hardware revenue, you can see that in Q1 software increase, but sorted hardware, they've basically moved in lockstep the last four quarters. And if anything, if there are any large transactions that are different than our current mix, you will see it in the numbers. Yeah. Hey Simon, it's Mike. I'll take that one. When we look at the public cloud business, certainly it is much -- it's -- it is similar to some of the hybrid cloud dynamics, I will talk about that in a second. There are certainly new transactions that we forecast, not only coming in from the hyperscalers.  But from our sales team as well, we got pipeline reports, we see what that looks like. So, we're able to forecast that more and more, it's also renewal rates, being able to forecast renewals and then really the big driver of all cloud software businesses up-sell, cross-sell. That's, obviously difficult for you folks to see those details.  But we've looked at all of those, certainly sales capacity as part of that on the hybrid cloud business. Keep in mind, I think it's now $2.3 billion of support revenue every year. That's much more of a renewal rate. We do look at cross-selling, upsell, and we also look at where we are in terms of pipelines and conversion rates and a big piece for us is obviously, do we have enough sales capacity?  So, I know we get a lot of questions about a net absolute go quarter-on-quarter sequentially. I would just encourage you when you look at that sequential, keep in mind, hey, the last couple of years. Have been very different than the last 10.  And it makes it -- I understand it makes it a little bit difficult, but hopefully, when we get through this COVID environment and it gets back to normal, those are more relevant, I think now it's very difficult to use those sequential growths to try to forecast the business. Sidney, its Mike. Just to make sure I get the -- you're talking about operating profits for the public cloud segment. That's your question? Okay. Yeah. I think the best way that I would encourage you to look at that is here's the great thing about the Cloud businesses. There is a lot of good comps out there that we look at all the time. And as we look at businesses that call it 250 million in ARR, as they grow to a billion.  There, you'd see not only a slight uptick in gross margin, but then obviously you see the dynamics of operating income. So, I would encourage you to take a look at some of those comparisons. We look at that a lot in terms of benchmarking our business largely went ends up happening is they turn cash-flow positive before they turn operating income because of again, the way they recognize revenue ratable.  So, I would encourage you to. We'll take a look at those and there's really no reason to believe, as we said today, that we wouldn't follow that comparable group as we march to $1 billion in ARR. Thank you. Yes. So, 33% increase in the software portion of product revenue. It's driven for the earlier question really by two things. One is the really nice growth in all-flash, but also less growth in HCI in some of the products that have less software and more hardware.  And I would expect if going forward, if we're talking about growth in product revenue, given the continued mix shift towards All-Flash, you should expect to see software -- the software portion grow faster than the total product portion. We're not going to guide to that other than to say it should grow faster than the total product number. Thank you."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon. And thanks to everyone for joining our Q1 fiscal year '22 earnings call. Building on our accelerating momentum through fiscal year 21, we delivered a strong start to fiscal year 22 with results at the high-end or above our guidance for Q1. Broad-based strength drove 12% revenue growth and 16% product revenue growth year-over-year.  Public cloud revenue grew triple-digits again this quarter up 155% from Q1 a year ago. Our results reflect solid customer demand and strong execution by our team in the quarter. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives remain top customer priorities, and we continue to benefit from these sizable long-term trends.  Customers need to simplify and modernize existing data centers and deploy traditional applications quickly and confidently. At the same time, customers are also accelerating their use of cloud, adopting modern application architectures like Kubernetes and micro-services for new workloads and deploying data-rich applications, like machine and deep learning.  With our data fabric strategy, we are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' most significant challenges in both modern and traditional applications on-premises and in hybrid multi-cloud environments. As I've said many times, our public cloud services not only allow us to participate in the rapidly growing cloud market, they also make us a more strategic data center partner to our enterprise customers, driving share gains in our hybrid cloud business.  In Q1, we introduced our new segment reporting disclosures for hybrid cloud and public cloud, corresponding with how I look at our business. We provided financial information for both segments in our earnings materials to give you better insight into the dynamics of the 2 segments.  We will maintain our focus on driving growth with our hybrid cloud portfolio while scaling our public cloud services in fiscal year '22. In Q1, hybrid cloud revenue grew 8% year-over-year, led by outstanding growth in our All-Flash-Array business, which increased 23% to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. Based on our strong revenue growth, I am confident that we again gained share in the storage and all-flash markets.  In the quarter, we delivered significant innovation that advances our flexible foundation for hybrid cloud, unified data management across on-premises and cloud environments. And simplifies the consumption and operation of hybrid cloud services. We further enhance the industry's leading and only cloud-ready storage operating system by introducing ONTAP 9.9, with security enhancements, new integrated data protection capabilities, and improved stamp performance.  We also released storage grid 11.5, which supports for data encryption using external key management, ransomware protection with S3 object locks, and increased performance with intelligent load balancing. And we announced a broad range of enhancements to Keystone flex subscription with new features for service providers, additional cloud support, a partner-delivered FlexPod as a service, and integration with Equinix colocation services.  Public cloud revenue grew 155% year-over-year, driven by Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights, and Spot by NetApp. It's been a year since we acquired Spot. And we are excited by the innovation we've brought to market under the Spot by NetApp brand. And the momentum we have with the spot offerings.  Public cloud ARR grew to $337 million, an increase of 89% year-over-year and public cloud dollar-based net retention rate remains healthy at 192%. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and growing. I am honored that we were recognized by Microsoft as the winner of their global customer experience partner of the year, and of their U.S. SAP on Azure Partner of the Year award.  We continue to broaden our public cloud services beyond storage and data management services. Today, we have customers extend, migrate, automate, and optimize the infrastructure, and data management capabilities for enterprise and cloud-native applications. Customers use NetApp public cloud services because we enabled them to use more Cloud at less cost. In Q1, we announced Spot PC, a fully managed, secure, and cost-effective Cloud desktop as a service for Azure virtual desktop, and Windows 365.  Additionally, we acquired Data Mechanics to accelerate the roadmap for spot wave, infrastructure and application, automation and optimization platform for high-growth, big data, and machine learning workloads in the Cloud. We also continue to deliver on our vision and strategy around application-aware infrastructure and data management for containers.  Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability with the optimal blend of spot reserved and on-demand compute instances reducing costs by up to 90%. In Q1, we evolve Spot Ocean into a suite of DevOps solutions. with Ocean Continuous Delivery and Ocean Insights. Ocean Continuous Delivery focuses on the most painful aspects of modern application delivery by automating mission-critical deployment in verification processes.  Ocean Insights is an analytical tool that gives users a full view of their application clusters and then previews the potential savings from Ocean. Last year, we introduced Astra Control, a rich set of storage and application-aware, data management services for cloud-based Kubernetes workloads. Astra extends the data fabric to the cloud-native world. And in Q1, we extended Astra to be a deployable on-premises software solution, Astra Control Center.  Wherever a customer chooses to deploy Kubernetes applications, we can accelerate the deployment, operation, and protection of these critical environments. Let me share with you a customer story to highlight the value Astra Control Center brings to enterprise customers. As a part of its transformation strategy, a leading telecommunications provider is using a modern IT architecture based on container-native applications.  These workloads are mission-critical and the customer turned to NetApp and Astra Control Center to address the challenges of data protection and disaster recovery that don't exist in the Kubernetes natively. Additionally, Astra helped them realize their vision of application portability across multiple Kubernetes distributions, and data sharing across multiple clusters. We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise storage and data management technology.  Our public cloud services drive further differentiation, expand our addressable market, and enable us to reach new customers. We deliver not only industry-leading storage services in the cloud, but also cloud automation and optimization services, and cloud infrastructure monitoring services.  You should expect us to capitalize on our advantage by enhancing our go-to-market activities, deepening our cloud partnerships, and delivering best-in-class, organic and inorganic innovations. Our strong customer momentum and the uniqueness of our public cloud services position furthers my confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal year \u201825.  Our strong first-quarter results underscore our value to customers in a hybrid multi-cloud, data-driven digital world. We are confident that we are well-positioned with the right portfolio and strategy to solve our customers' most pressing challenges. With focused execution and demonstrated leadership in hybrid multi-cloud, we are reshaping the industry.  We made a number of innovation announcements this quarter, and we will continue to bring industry-leading capabilities to market, further enhancing our differentiated position in Cloud and software. I am excited for what this year will bring. And I'm confident in our ability to deliver top-line growth as we support our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys.  Before I turn the call over to Mike to walk through our financial results and expectations, I want to thank the NetApp team, our customers, and our partners for an outstanding quarter. I also want to remind you that we'll be hosting our fully Digital Insight customer event in October. I hope you'll be able to join us. With that, I will turn it over to Mike. I think with regard to the second question, you had Katy with a mix of offerings, we feel really good about Spot by NetApp, and the work that we're doing with the hyperscalers, both especially Microsoft and Google were strong in the quarter. I think the seasonality reflected in, as we had said, reflected in the offerings that were sold by NetApp they grew nicely, but not as much as the hyperscalers than Spot did. And so, I think that we have never signaled of V-shaped snapback or anything like that. Our belief has been that other than a small number of customers who were directly impacted by COVID, the vast majority of the customers that we've worked with had a steady demand pattern for several quarters now, certainly, we are seeing strengthening in demand as the economies reopen.  But this is a reflection of more long-term trends, transformational work that customers are doing to digitize or hybridize their business, the work that they're doing to build cloud environments, and so on.  So, I don't think that we see this as a pent-up demand kind of model. I think with regard to the sustainability of our business, we feel really good about product revenue. We -- as we said, we think that we can sustain product revenue growth each of the quarters of this year.  And particularly our Flash segment is very, very strong. And so, we see really good momentum there. And no reason to feel anything but real good confidence about where we are. Listen, we just finished a phenomenal quarter. In Q1, we grew our all-flash business by 23% overall product revenue by 16%, and cloud by 155% year-on-year.  We raised our fiscal year to 8% to 9% growth and anticipate delivering close to $5 in earnings per share. These are all record numbers, operating margins full year, and earnings per share for the Company. I feel very, very good about where we are. Listen, I think that components being constrained and the supply base being dynamic and fluid is something that everybody in the industry faces. Our team has done an excellent job, and the fact that we have a single operating system and a single architecture for the vast majority of our revenue gives us the flexibility to adapt and react in real-time to potential supply constraints.  Both the gross margin guide and the revenue guide that we've given anticipate puts and takes across the supply chain. With regard to our ability to manage pricing in an inflationary environment, I think the product gross margin strength in Q1 and the outlook for Q2 remains strong and is a reflection of the discipline in our field organization.  With regard to do I see customers buying up products ahead of scheduled to deal with supply constraints. I don't see that, maybe there are occasional anecdote situations. But the vast majority as we've said, it's a pretty steady and strong demand pattern across a broad range of deals. You see that in our results this quarter. Mike, do you want to add anything? With regard to our confidence in the cloud business, I think we feel very, very good about the portfolio that we have. It serves a broader and broader range of used cases, both traditional applications, as well as net-new applications. Second, we are adding a lot of customers, both through NetApp pathways and particularly the hyperscaler pathways.  Third, once a customer joins our platform, as you can see from our dollar-based net retention rate, they expand quite substantially with NetApp. They like the portfolio when they do a lot more with us. I think those three key fundamentals of the business drive my confidence in being able to take up the bottom of the range to this early in the year. I think overall, as we said, we continue to be a disciplined management team in the way we run the business. You should expect, as you see in the numbers this year that we should grow topline ahead of expenses, and that should create leverage in the model.  I think as Mike outlined, we wanted to get to 55 points of product gross margins in the hybrid cloud business, we have achieved that and we want to maintain that for the rest of this year. And then in terms of public cloud, we said that we wanted to get it to be accretive to the margin structure of the core business, which it is.  And we weren't -- we have expectations to continue to improve that over time towards a more SaaS-like gross margin model. Both of those elements top line as well as gross margin should allow us to be kind of creating leverage in the operating margin model of the Company. Mike, do you want to add anything? I think hybrid arrays as we have consistently said, have a place in customer environments. There are a set of use cases we have consistently maintained that a hybrid array has a better solution to offer than an all-flash array.  And so, we continue to see an opportunity for hybrid arrays to have a go-forward, enduring place. And customer's environments are hybrid array business is a strong business. We have a differentiated value proposition in hybrid, just like we do in all-flash. I think we are in the early innings of enterprise use of Cloud for [Indiscernible] mission-critical, business-critical application. I think we see that over the next few years, as businesses deploy more of their core operations on public clouds.  The opportunities we have around compute, automation, and management through Spot storage and data protection and management through Cloud Volumes, and monitoring through Cloud Insights will be a very, very strong business.  And all of the hyperscaler partners that we work with see it much the same way, which is why they're building more and more capabilities with us. We also see a new growth engine in the public cloud segment.  You, all the cloud-native work we're doing around containers and some are less. So, Spot Ocean be mentioned, is the same value proposition that spot brings for enterprise applications to containerized applications. That is seeing very strong adoption.  We've worked with some of the hyperscalers around Astra Control, and we're starting to see that get to wrap, especially with new cloud-native Kubernetes applications. And then we have started work on Cloud Insights for Kubernetes to bring monitoring and management. I feel very good about the portfolio. There's a lot of organic innovation and Spot has proven to be a really stellar acquisition for the Company. Thank you. I think with regard to where we see strength, I mean, this was a really balanced quarter across all the geographies. You can look at our results in the Americas, you look at the results in Europe and in Asia-Pacific, we grew in all the major geographies very, very nicely.  So, I feel very good about that. With regard to the direct versus indirect, I think it's a reflection of some of our largest customers who continue to buy direct, being a strong contributor to some of our all-flash array growth tried so I think that's sort of the puts and takes.  I wouldn't read anything into the specific quarter-on-quarter trends in the channel, like [Indiscernible] seek good opportunities to grow our business across both direct and indirect channels. We have seen a steady consistent demand for our offerings and our capabilities for several quarters now. I want to just remind us that we had a strong year last year, particularly the second half of last year. And so, we continue to see that the overall demand environment is brightening steadily.  We have said from many quarters, we saw the U.S. and China leading the recovery. Europe a few months, 6 to 12 months behind that. And then the developing economies, maybe another 6 to 12 months beyond that, we continue to hold that perspective with the benefit of several quarters of experience.  And so, I feel very good. I think that we have customers who are seeing a better economic environment, starting to build confidence in spending on technology. I think within that segment, hybrid cloud, digital transformation initiatives are well-positioned and NetApp is well-positioned to go after that. Listen, I think as Mike and I said in prepared remarks, the component supply chain is a dynamic and slowing supply chain. It is well understood in the industry. Our team has done an excellent job managing through that. We have good deep relationships with suppliers and long-term commitments with many of them.  I think as Mike and I have suggested, we will continue to use cash to buy ahead of what we need so that we can maintain supply availability. You think that's a good use of cash in the current environment. And I think that having a single operating system that drives the vast majority of our business allows us to qualify and adapt to the environment that we're in.  I want to thank our supply chain teams for continued execution and our engineering team and our partners for working with us. And I think our Sales teams have done a really good job managing through the environment to capture the value that we should for our products. Thank you. It's 29%, so it's up another percent. As we have said, consistently, our installed base continues to grow as we acquire new customers and new workloads. And Flash is penetrating that installed base and incremental 1% to 2% at a time, right?  So, a long runway ahead on that installed base. With regard to the competitive environment, again, we don't see any sort of substantive changes. I think we have a really good offering in the market.  I think we believe we have taken a share in the environment and we're going to continue to stay focused on winning not only 30, so workloads, but also new types of workloads like Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Data lakes, and others with our all-flash portfolio. I think with regard to the work that we're doing in the public cloud, as Mike has mentioned, and I've said before, the vast majority of our solutions are software-based. And we scale that software out using clustering so that it can go faster by going wider to more computing demand.  With regard to certain traditional applications that are more scale-up applications like an [Indiscernible] or something like that that requires a scale-up platform to support it, that's where we used hardware. And I think the software that we have can be run on generic hardware for the broad range of used cases, or our proprietary, our own hardware, for the narrow, really specific application in this case. Thanks, Kris. In closing, we delivered a great start to FY '22. And now very well positioned for continued growth throughout the year. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives. The remaining top customer priorities. And we continue to benefit from these sizable long-term trends.  Our hybrid cloud and public cloud offerings put NetApp in a unique position to address our customers' most pressing challenges. Our cloud and software intellectual property truly differentiate us. As a result, I'm more confident than ever in our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, customers, and partners. Thanks for joining us."

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKris Newton: Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian, and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make a number of forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially.

Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks Kris. Welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter FY 23 call. Our Q4 results reflect solid execution in the face of ongoing macroeconomic challenges. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our guidance, with disciplined operational management yielding all-time high quarterly operating margin and EPS above expectations. For FY 23, we delivered record high annual operating margin and EPS, despite the slow demand environment and relatively flat revenue from FY 22. Even as customers are tightening their budgets in response to the macro, they are not stopping investments in applications and technologies that drive business productivity and growth. Digital transformation projects involving business analytics, AI, data security, and application modernization, both on premises and in the cloud remain top priorities for IT organizations. This drives our confidence in the health of our markets and future growth opportunity, despite the temporary macro headwinds. We are participating in the areas of priority spending with a modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure and data management. By providing customers with the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security, and sustainability, we increase our relevance and value. And we continue to introduce new innovations to deliver greater customer value, further strengthening our position. On our last call, I outlined our three areas of focus to sharpen our execution to better deliver results, while at the same time, positioning ourselves for long-term success. As a reminder, the focus areas are: remain prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts across the company in support of our storage systems business, and build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. As you can see from our Q4 and FY 2023 results, we have demonstrated success in managing the elements within our control and staying flexible to adapt to the ever changing environment. We remain committed to maintaining operational discipline as we move through FY 2024, adjusting as appropriate, to drive operating margin expansion and EPS growth while also continuing to invest for the long-term. Turning to our storage systems business. Q4 Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.4 billion was down 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Our all-flash array business decreased 4% from Q4 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.1 billion. Similar to Q3, headwinds from large enterprises weighed on our product and AFA revenue. As you\u2019ve seen, we are reinvigorating our storage portfolio, innovating to deliver greater customer value, reach new customers, and better address areas of priority spending and market growth. ONTAP AI and FlexPod AI are proven and tested reference architectures to help speed and simplify AI deployments. These solutions are designed around our all-flash arrays which are uniquely suited to meet the performance, multiprotocol, and data mobility demands of AI workloads. In Q4, we demonstrated industry leading performance in the GPU Direct benchmark, proof of our ability to enable customers to use the full power of GPU technology for AI. Our affinity to AI use cases doesn\u2019t stop at performance; ONTAP includes native data management tools that streamline workflows for data science teams and integrate multi-platform, multi-site, and multi-cloud data pipelines. With new performance and data management features planned in upcoming ONTAP releases, we expect to raise the bar again not just for performance but for total workflow solutions that help companies realize the benefits of AI faster and with better results. The new AFF C-series, our comprehensive portfolio of QLC-based all-flash arrays, began shipping late in Q4. We are very pleased with the initial customer response. In addition to lots of quoting activity, we closed a good number of deals in the fourth quarter. One of our early C-series wins was a $15 million deal at a large financial institution for business-critical workloads in its cloud-ready, service-level defined environment. We beat the competition with a solution that was significantly denser and more energy efficient. Following this highly successful launch, we introduced the NetApp ASA A-series early in Q1. The ASA is a new line of SAN-specific flash storage systems that deliver high levels of performance, scalability, data availability, efficiency, and cloud connectivity with up to 50% lower power consumption and associated carbon emissions than competitive offerings. The ASA complements our unified storage offerings to address block-only use cases, while avoiding the operational and data siloes of competitors' products. We are also innovating to improve the customer experience. In Q4, we introduced NetApp Advance, a portfolio of programs bringing predictability and adaptability, including the Storage Lifecycle Program for non-disruptive storage upgrades. At the start of Q1, we announced ONTAP One, a simple way to buy and consume all the native software capabilities of ONTAP. We\u2019re enhancing the value of these built-in capabilities with our Ransomware Recovery Guarantee, which leverages ONTAP\u2019s unique combination of key built-in security and ransomware protection features to detect, stop, and recover from ransomware attacks in real-time. In addition to delivering significant innovation, we have also rebalanced our go-to-market efforts, including focusing our broad sales organization on selling flash through compensation plans and reinstituting a specialist sales team for cloud. We believe these actions will allow the team to better address the large storage TAM. Entering FY 2024, I am confident that these actions will enable us to drive product revenue growth and regain share in the all-flash array market. We are seeing early, positive signs, but the full benefit of these changes will take time to develop and should be a driver for product revenue growth in the second half. While we are sharpening our attack on the storage market, we are not taking our eye off the Public Cloud opportunity. Public Cloud ARR of $620 million was up 23% year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, driven by strength in Public Cloud storage services. Our Public Cloud business in Q4 was backend loaded, resulting in softer revenue and lower DBNRR than our ARR results would indicate. Public Cloud revenue for Q4 was $151 million and DBNRR was 114%. Our Public Cloud Services are highly differentiated, with a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors and they create customer preference for NetApp. The number of total cloud customers, customers using multiple of our Public Cloud services, and customers with greater than $500,000 of revenue in the quarter, all continue to grow nicely. While, like our cloud partners, we see continued cloud optimizations, some of the customers whose optimizations created significant headwinds for us in FY 2023 have kicked off new projects that we expect to scale over the next 18 months. We believe that our first-party storage services, branded and sold by our cloud partners, represent our biggest opportunity. We have aligned our sales specialist resources to our cloud partners\u2019 customer segmentation and go-to-market structure to tighten our alignment to and improve our execution against this opportunity. Over the course of FY 2024, we will scale our customer success team to further improve customer retention and expansion and develop a more focused cloud channel model. Cloud operations remains an important market for us, and we have dedicated go-to-market resources to address this opportunity. We have not wavered in our conviction that Public Cloud services has the potential to be a multibillion-dollar ARR business for us. While the shift to cloud is experiencing an industry-wide slowdown, the long-term trend in favor of cloud is unchanged. In conclusion, while FY 2023 was not the year we expected at its outset, our disciplined management enabled us to overcome a number of headwinds to deliver all-time high operating margin and EPS. The fundamentals of our business model are sound and our confidence in our strategy and the health of long-term opportunity is unchanged. We are entering fiscal year 2024 with substantially more innovation and a new, more focused operating model to attack the areas of priority spending. In this uncertain environment, we will remain agile and continue to be disciplined stewards of the business. We believe our actions will drive margin expansion and earnings growth while yielding top line growth in the back half of the year. Thank you to the NetApp team for their dedication and focus. I am pleased with our progress, but we recognize our work is not done. We look forward to building on this momentum and driving long-term value for our shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George and good afternoon everyone. As George noted, we are laser focused on managing the elements within our control. Our focus enabled us to deliver strong P&L performance for the full year and Q4. Before getting into the details, let me quickly highlight the key themes of our results and expectations for fiscal year 2024. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. We delivered record setting operating margin and EPS above our guidance range in both Q4 and fiscal year 2023. We will continue to prudently manage the business to position ourselves for long-term success while driving further operating margin expansion and EPS growth in fiscal year 2024. We are confident in the strength of our position and alignment to areas of priority spend. However, macro uncertainties and FX headwinds have pressured IT budgets and lowered spending. We believe these headwinds are temporary and that the spending environment will rebound in time. We reached our product gross margin target of mid-50s ahead of expectations. In fiscal year 2024, we expect to maintain product gross margin at this level and drive improvement to Public Cloud gross margin. In fiscal year 2023, we returned 148% of free cash flow to shareholders and reduced full year share count by 4% from the prior year. We plan to continue a strong policy of shareholder returns in fiscal year 2024. Now to the details. Fiscal year 2023 billings of $6.41 billion were down 4% from fiscal year 2022. Revenue of $6.36 billion was up 1% year-over-year. Adjusting for the headwind from FX, billings would have been down 1%, and revenue would have been up 4% year-over-year. Disciplined operational management yielded all-time fiscal year highs for operating margin and EPS. Operating margin was 24.2%, including a 150-basis point headwind from FX. EPS was $5.59 and included $0.57 of year over year FX headwind. Q4 billings of $1.67 billion were down 17% year-over-year, including roughly two points of FX headwind. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.58 billion, down 6% from last year or 4%, adjusting for FX. The uncertain macro negatively impacted revenue in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments, as customers continue to exhibit caution in capital expenditures and look to optimize cloud spend. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.43 billion was down 8% year-over-year. Product revenue was $744 million and down 17% from Q4 last year. Support revenue of $598 million increased 1% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited the year ahead of expectations at $620 million, up 23% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue composed 10% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 26% year-over-year to $151 million. We exited fiscal year 2023 with $4.31 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 2% year-over-year. Growth of deferred revenue is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth; Q4 marks the 21st consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth. Q4 consolidated gross margin was 69%, above our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 69%. Product gross margin was 55%, well ahead of guidance, driven by lower premiums, better mix, and lower FX headwinds. As we\u2019ve described on previous calls, we expect to retain all the benefit from the reduction in premiums and will be responsive to market pricing of commodity components. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin was 66%. Q4 again highlighted the strength of our business model and our operational discipline with operating margin of 26%, an all-time quarterly high. EPS of $1.54 was comfortably above the high end of guidance and included $0.08 of year-over-year FX headwind. In Q4, cash flow from operations was $235 million and free cash flow was $196 million. Free cash flow for fiscal year 2023 of $868 million came in below expectations due to lower collections and timing of payments. As we noted on our last call, Q4 cash flow included certain one-time restructuring and tax payments, together totaling approximately $85 million. Inventory turns of 12 were steady from last quarter and last year. During Q4, we repurchased $150 million in stock and paid out $106 million in cash dividends. For the year, we repurchased a total of $850 million in stock and paid out $432 million in cash dividends, representing 148% of free cash flow. Q4 diluted share count of 217 million was down 5% year-over-year. We have approximately $400 million left on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of fiscal year 2023 and today are announcing an additional authorization of $1 billion. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We closed the year with $3.07 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now, to guidance. Let me underscore our confidence in our strategy and the strength of our position in addressing key customer priorities, like business analytics, AI, data security, and application modernization. However, we expect the macro to remain challenged, with continued pressure on IT budgets and the demand environment. As a result, we expect fiscal year 2024 total revenue to be down in the low to mid-single-digits measured on a percentage basis. Public Cloud will continue to be a positive contributor with revenue growth expected in the mid-teens. Implied in our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance is year-over-year growth in the second half driven by sales of recently introduced flash products and benefits from our go-to-market changes. While we are hopeful that the macroeconomy will improve in the second half of our fiscal year, our plans for fiscal year 2024 incorporate the environment we are seeing today and do not assume a material change to the economic or demand backdrop. We expect fiscal year 2024 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%. We believe that product margins will remain approximately 55%, supported by lower premiums and a rotation to higher margin, all-flash products. To take advantage of record low NAND prices, we have made strategic purchase commitments to lock in pricing for a large portion of our expected fiscal year 2024 SSD demand. This will help us maintain product gross margin levels when component prices rise in the future. We expect to see Public Cloud gross margin improvement in fiscal year 2024, driven by revenue scale and lower depreciation expense. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin target of 75% to 80%. We anticipate operating margins of approximately 25% and EPS of $5.65 to $5.85. Implied in this guidance is the expectation that we will hold operating expenses roughly flat versus fiscal year 2023. Fiscal year 2024 op ex includes benefits from the Q4 reduction in force, offset by annual merit increases, a reset of variable compensation, and incremental expenses to support our first in-person sales kick off and INSIGHT user conference since 2019. Operating expenses should be spread fairly evenly throughout the year. We expect a tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%. Operating cash flow will move in line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital. As we\u2019ve stated before, fiscal year 2023 should be the peak for CapEx with expenditures beginning to come down in fiscal year 2024. Our healthy cash flow generation enables us to continue our strong program of capital returns to shareholders. In fiscal year 2024, we intend to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in share buybacks and dividends. We plan to hold our quarterly dividend steady at $0.50 per share throughout fiscal year 2024, with the remainder of free cash going to share buybacks. We expect the timing of buybacks to be roughly similar to fiscal year 2023, and to reduce share count by at least 2% in fiscal year 2024. Now, on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 revenue to range between $1.325 billion and $1.475 billion, which at the midpoint implies a decline of 12% year-over-year. Remember that first half fiscal year 2023 revenue, most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog from supply chain constraints, impacting the year-over-year comparisons. We expect Q1 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70% and operating margin to be approximately 20%. EPS should be in the range of $1 to $1.10. Q1 cash flow will be impacted by payments associated with SSD purchase commitments, partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments year-over-year related to our fiscal year 2023 performance. In closing, I want to echo George\u2019s appreciation of the NetApp team and their continued commitment in this uncertain environment. As I look forward into fiscal year 2024, I am confident in our strategy and our ability to continue to improve our execution and increase profitability. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kris for Q&A.\nKris Newton: Thanks Mike. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And our first question will come from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. Thank you. This is Mike on behalf of Aaron. I just wanted to ask, you mentioned some customers have kicked off new projects following a period of digestion or optimization. I'm just curious, can you give us a sense of how many customers you put in this bucket versus ones that continue to be cautious or maybe are becoming incrementally more cautious, just trying to get a sense of how the demand environment has changed? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Broadly speaking, the Q4 demand environment was not substantially different from what we saw in Q3, and our plans for next year contemplate continuation of the same environment. We talked about in the cloud segment, some of the larger customers who had significantly optimized their landscape through the course of the prior quarters began to take on the projects that we anticipated them taking on. These projects take some time to ramp. We also saw strength in new customer additions and the number of customers that were using multiple products from NetApp, so all good signs for future revenue growth. That being said, customers on a broad basis, still cautious about spending and particularly in the large enterprise segment.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thanks for taking my question. I guess for the first one. If I sort of -- you reiterated a few times you're really not baking in any macro improvement to the guide, but you did highlight the opportunity to get back to revenue growth in the second half. Just wondering if you can help us think through both of those pieces, particularly when I sort of put them against each other, it does look like you're calling for more of a share gain than revenue rebound in the second half of the year, what sort of drives confidence in this sort of a sequential ramp in revenue through the year? And is there more to it than sort of share gain? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think broadly speaking, we are super excited about the recent portfolio introductions we've made. We've seen the benefits of improved focus in our field organization. It takes a few quarters to build. And I think if you look at the pattern of sequential linearity through next fiscal year, it is similar to what we have seen in more traditional years. I think FY 2023 was a bit anomalous. And so we feel good about the progress through the year. I think with regard to the macro, we are not -- we've built our plan assuming the macro stays the same. Clearly, if there's upside to the macro, that should be a benefit to us over the course of the year.\nMike Berry: Hey, Samik, it's Mike. If I could just add on to that and want to underline the one point George made. When we talk about our guide for 2024, when we talk about linearity, that's -- and we define that as total revenue we expect in the first half versus the second half. That's much more at where we've been historically, which is about 48% and 52% in those halves. So, when you take a look at the year-over-year growth rates in 2024, just keep in mind that those were heavily influenced by the backlog last year. So when you normalize for that, it looks like a much more normal linearity in 2024.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. On the cloud business, the growth expectations that you have for fiscal 2024. Can you just outline how you're thinking about sort of retention business versus new business wins? And also curious if you obviously highlighted the AI opportunity, but do you see that opportunity on the cloud revenue side as well? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think, first of all, we are very pleased with new customer acquisition, the broadening of our workloads, clearly the performance, and the efficiency and multiprotocol capability of our storage is an advantage whether for AI workloads, whether they are on-premises or in Public Cloud. What we've seen in Public Cloud for AI is a lot of data science teams using the prebuilt tools that are available on the Public Cloud to calibrate and get their learning models of the curve quickly. And that's uniquely available with NetApp. I think with regard to our perspective for the full year, listen, cloud storage, especially the storage that's sold alongside the hyperscalers will be the primary driver of our business next year. I think if you look at the total dollars in any given year, the opportunity to expand existing customers is substantially larger than the amount that new customers contribute because they are just small, but we feel good about the pace of new customer acquisition. And now our installed base of cloud customers is very substantial. So, there's a good opportunity to cross-sell and upsell them more capabilities.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. Great. Thank you. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe first question, you noted starting to kind of -- noted seeing customers coming out of optimization periods and starting to add workloads. Just wanted to gain a sense of, are you seeing that more with larger or smaller customers or any particular types of workloads that they're starting to kind of add back? And then maybe second question, the Series-C customer that you noted winning in the quarter. Just any commentary on whether that was an existing customer? And just you noted efficiency and kind of energy efficiency being the reason for the sale, but just kind of how long that sales cycle was just any details there would be helpful. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. So, let me get the two questions. The first one is what we've seen in the cloud environment is that customers are still progressing new workload deployment, meaning new applications, analytics environment, AIML environment and so on, right, and that has not slowed down. I think there was a period of time where customers were monitoring their environments and optimizing the infrastructure, but the new deployments continue. I think where we have seen people being more cautious is about migration of on-premises environments, for example, to Public Cloud, where they are benchmarking the total cost of each of those landscapes. We have a large and growing opportunity in public cloud on new workloads because of the capabilities and the certifications that we continue to bring. And so we're excited about that opportunity. I think with regard to the customer we mentioned, they were not using NetApp for the landscape that we won. We won -- we replaced a competitive environment, and we did so based on the new C-Series products that had a significant advantage over all the competitive products, both in terms of our traditional advantages around multiprotocol and all of the data management features, but we're also substantially more efficient from a power consumption and density standpoint.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steven Fox of Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi, good afternoon. Just one question for me. I don't think I'm alone in this, but the product gross margin surprised substantially the upside of seven, eight points of upside by my account. Can you just break down how that happened? And whether any of that is transitional? How much carries through the rest of the year in your full fiscal year plan? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Sure. Hey, Steven, it's Mike. So, let's do the walk from Q3 to Q4, what we guided and where we ended up. So, Q3 product margins were about 46%. We guided approximately 50% largely with the full expectation that we would continue to get relief from premiums that we've talked a lot about. And my goal is to never mention the work premium is on another call going forward. That was about 500 basis point benefit to the quarter, and we expected that to be. The two things that were incremental is mix came in better than we expected. And by that, we mean the capacity per system came in a little bit better. If you remember, in Q3, we talked about that, that caused a little bit of a reduction in gross margins as well as a little bit better all-flash margin. And then FX helped a little bit quarter-on-quarter as well. So, that's the walk from 46% to 55%. As we look into next year, we're assuming that we can retain that 55%. There's a little bit of premium benefit left, but we're also going to make sure that we are flexible as the component pricing rolls through that we can be competitive in the market. And then in addition, we also talked about, hey, we've done some strategic purchase commitments to lock in a large portion of the NAND supply for fiscal 2024 at today's prices. So, we're excited about that, being able to not have to deal with that when in the likely event it starts to go up. As we all know, NAND pricing is at an all-time fall. So, that's the walk from Q3 to Q4, how we did a little bit better and our outlook into fiscal 2024.\nSteven Fox: Great, that\u2019s super helpful. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Liu: Hi. Thank you. This is Irvin Liu on for Amit. I wanted to double-click on the drivers of a public cloud ARR outperformance during the quarter. I think you referenced cloud storage services strength. But can you talk about what you saw in data management and cloud optimization. Is there anything to call out for Spot just given the increased focus on optimizing cloud spend? And I also have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: The CloudOps business was relatively flat sequentially. There were new customer additions and some optimizations within existing customers. The majority of the growth rate sequentially from Q3 to Q4 was driven by cloud storage, especially the consumption business with our cloud provider partners.\nIrvin Liu: Got it. Thank you. And then about 11% of your revenue is public sector. From a debt ceiling perspective, I wanted to ask, are there direct impacts we should be thinking about as it relates to your federal government exposure. Is there a potential for a delay in your accounts payable, or any potential changes in how you view the budget environment looking through the back half of calendar 2023?\nMike Berry: Yes. So, thanks for the question. At this point, we don't expect any meaningful change in that business from an AR perspective or from a bookings perspective. We'll certainly watch it. We would expect this thing to have to resolve itself in the relatively near-term. At this point, we don't expect any material impact from all those discussions.\nIrvin Liu: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. George, can you take a step back and maybe talk a bit from a higher level on how conversations with customers are going with regard to AI. And I'm thinking not just like near-term, but I'm trying to understand or figure out because I think we all are, what the various roles IT hardware will play in the AI proliferation that we're seeing? So, I'm wondering, well, you've got training, so do you need fast storage, and then you move to inferencing, so it could be more traditional storage or -- is that not correct? I'm just -- I'm wondering, I know you're having probably a lot of conversations with customers that could be beneficial to us. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. We have done exceptionally well in the analytics, AI, deep learning environments. We have both technology leadership across multi-protocol, high-performance, scale-out storage and multi-cloud, which are super important buckets of what customers need to drive these analytic applications. And we have done -- we've doubled our business this past year to a very significant amount. I think the key use cases are business problems around, for example, in financial services, sentiment analysis, recommendation engines, advanced recommendations engines and e-commerce, precision medicine, cross-department clinical AI solutions. And then even last quarter, we had a substantial win in a new form of metaverse around autonomous driving, right? So, these are advanced analytics engines that are being deployed on very large-scale data sets. They typically require file and object and cloud integration. And today's environments are not the advanced LLM model, the majority of the business we see today are really around re-platforming from Hadoop to more modern environments as well as the use of advanced neural networks. We see the impending onslaught of ChatGPT and tools like that, where customers will take the OpenAI or open source generative AI model, but then build it on top of their own data sets, which require the storage that we have. So, we're excited about the future, and we have real strong performance in our AI and analytics business today.\nShannon Cross: Thank you. That was helpful. Mike, can you talk a bit about -- I know OpEx is supposed to be flatter -- you're planning on it being flat this year. But I'm wondering, you delayed some investments and you've had some cost cutting in that. I'm wondering, given the gross margin outperformance in the relative strength you're seeing or improvement you're seeing, is there room to maybe reaccelerate some of those investments? Or is it just too early to make that call?\nMike Berry: Yes, Shannon. So, I'd say we actually have accelerated some of those investments. We've talked about doing CONVERGE, which is our sales conference in person as well as INSIGHT. That's the first time in three years. We do a very good job. I give the team a lot of credit for reallocating dollars internally to really -- to reallocate to growth initiatives. You've seen us react very quickly from a product perspective in the last couple of months, C-Series and other things. So, I think at this point, we feel good about where we are from an OpEx perspective. We'll see how we get through the year. And when we talk about prudently managing the business for us, it is make sure we spend the money in the right areas, but we always want to make sure we're investing in growth. And that's what you have, and that's what we put in the guide for the year.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you very much.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just picking up on Shannon's AI question, George, do you see an opportunity over time to have the product growth rate altered by AI on-prem. And actually, we just love maybe even a similar question for cloud software as well as this time? T hanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think the AI applications that drive business productivity are a topic of discussion in every CEO room around the globe because it is a key way to bring speed and operating efficiency to companies. And so many of the applications that we talked about help transform a company's business model. And so they will get prioritized in spending envelopes and we are really excited about our opportunity to capitalize on that. We have done the work not only to build high-performance storage, but in addition, build the integrations into all of the AI and data science tool chains that are common in the world and to enable a really flexible data pipeline that can start in the cloud where the tools are available, but then can be operated at a scale on the data in your data center. So, we're really excited about what the future holds and we're going to keep pushing forward. I see cloud and I see AI as two big opportunities for NetApp. We are super well positioned in both, and we look to take advantage of both of them going forward.\nAnanda Baruah: That's great. And I guess as a follow-up, can you just talk a little bit about the ability -- and I guess maybe even over what timeframe that the newer NAND technologies could have on share gains on-premise relative to HDD? Just how should we think about that dynamic and over what period of time? Thanks so much.\nGeorge Kurian: I think the lower cost NAND technology that we've introduced in our products will become a bigger part of our business through the course of fiscal year 2024 and will be the biggest part of the flash storage growth rate in the industry over the next two or three years. These HDD replacement cycles are multiyear, right? I think if you saw the high-performance 15,000 HDD segment, it took multiple years to transition that footprint. And so 10,000, which is an even bigger part of the market will take many years to transition. But we're excited about our offerings, the start that we've had and the opportunity over the next many years.\nAnanda Baruah: Thanks a lot. Really appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nRobert Mertens: Hello. This is Robert Mertens on for Krish. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats on the strong execution and guide with a targeted 2024 product margins of around 55%. Could you give a little bit more color on how the strategic purchases of SSDs plays into the target? And on the flip side, if there's any risk to competitors doing the same or headwinds if pricing declines, if there's any elasticity there? And then I have one follow-up.\nMike Berry: Sure. It's Mike. So, let's take both of those. So, the guide of 55% assumes that's what we came out of Q4 with. There are some nice continued tailwinds going into next year. One is, of course, the continued shift to all-flash, which has higher margins. In addition to that, we do have a little bit of benefit from premium. So, we feel good about the 55% number. The strategic purchases really help, I'll call it hedge that number to lock the prices in that we have today. I would certainly assume given the lower price of NAND that other folks are doing similar exercises. And why we're at 55%, probably we want to make sure that we have some flexibility around pricing to your very point. So, to the extent that there are changes in the market pricing, we feel like we have that flexibility to stay within 55%, but still be able to get to our product revenue goals for the year.\nRobert Mertens: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just one more on the public cloud. Do you think the negative impact from cloud optimization efforts is behind us for the year? And would you mind sharing, just sort of which areas within your cloud portfolio are seeing the strongest growth? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think it's premature to signal that cloud optimization is behind us. As we commented in our prepared remarks, I think that this customers will continue to manage their spend where that is on data center infrastructure or on public cloud. I think what we continue to see is the projects and applications that drive business performance especially core business growth are getting prioritized and invested. Those could be analytics, those could be AI, those could be digital manufacturing projects and on and on, right? I think where we have seen optimization and some amount of caution is in migration of enterprise workloads from data centers, the old lift and shift, I think people are taking a hard look at benchmarking both environments, whether it's public cloud or on-premises. So I think that's where we continue to see some optimization. In the plan for 2024, the real focus is on accelerating our hyperscaler storage. The storage that is sold alongside our cloud providers, it had a good quarter this quarter. We are uniquely positioned in the market, and we are serving a wider and wider range of applications with the strength of our technology. So, we're excited about that.\nRobert Mertens: Got it. Thank you for letting me ask the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Long of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Two, if I could as well, first, I was hoping you could talk a little bit, I think, last quarter, you talked about kind of increased focus given the large enterprises were a little bit more macro impacted, a little bit more focused on small and midsized businesses. Can you give us an update there on how that push into that customer class is going? And then second, if I could just come back to the QLC-based products. George, talking about it taking more share. I'm just curious how you think it's going to further proliferate your portfolio. So, are you going to start moving into different workloads, different use cases? How should we think about kind of progression of new products to help gain more share of all-flash and grow as a percent of your business? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. So, maybe I can start with the portfolio. We've introduced three major expansions of our portfolio in the all-flash segment over the last four months to five months. We have capacity flash, the broadest, most feature-rich, most competitive capacity flash products in the industry. We've announced a set of entry flash products that are shipping, which brings our industry-leading software in an all-flash configuration at a price point that is perfect for midsized enterprises. And we introduced early this quarter and All SAN Array, which is a block-only storage configuration for customers that have large block storage environment and don't want to use unified storage for those offerings. So, major expansion to our product portfolio, the most significant expansion since we introduced our flash portfolio many years ago. So, I'm excited about that. That gives us opportunity to both expand wallet share in enterprise customers going after parts of the wallet that we used to not serve, but importantly, address the expanding opportunity within commercial customers. Our commercial segment has outperformed the enterprise segment throughout this fiscal year and again did so in Q4, representing the resilience of those customers to the macro spending environment. So, we feel good about that. We moved some resources within our spending envelope. We reprioritized some more resources to cover the commercial market for fiscal year 2024.\nTim Long: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes, thank you. Congrats on nice results. Your billings did decelerate quite a bit, the 15% year-over-year decline versus 7% year-over-year into Q3. So, given your guidance for analysts, it sounds like you do expect this billings to represent a low point in terms of the billings trends. Is that correct? And if so, why is that?\nMike Berry: Yes. Hey, Nehal, it's Mike. So, if you take a look at Q4, so total revenue was down year-over-year by about 6%. Total billings were down by about 17%. When you take a look at the difference between billings and revenue, product revenue and product billings are basically the same because there is no change in deferred. What we saw in the second half, especially in Q4, is lower product bookings than correlated with less support bookings, specifically multiyear bookings that come with new sales. So, we do expect to see that come back as we go through next year. That's going to be the difference that you see in billings and revenue. So based on the guidance for the year, which is revenue down low to mid-single-digit percent, we do expect billings to be more flat to somewhere around plus or minus a couple of percentage points to do a little bit better than revenue, again, because of the contribution from support.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. Thank you very much.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could maybe unpack the public cloud business a little bit. In that last quarter, it seemed apparent that some of it was very much a recurring revenue stream and some of it was more sensitive and consumption-based. And I'd just like to get level set as to how to think of the composition of PCS as to what you would consider consumption-based and what you would consider truly recurring? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Hey Simon, it's Mike. So, we'll do those two ways. We've given this detail in the past. So, cloud storage represents approximately 60% of the total cloud ARR. CloudOps represents about 40%. It stayed amazingly consistent through fiscal 2023. If you then look at what is consumption versus subscription, consumption is going to more than half of the business, and it's growing faster than subscription because the two products that are growing the fastest that George referenced, ANf and FSx, which are our first-party cloud storage products are consumption-based. So, you should expect to see that percentage of consumption continue to climb as we go through 2024. And then it doesn't mean that subscription is declining. It means that the consulting business is growing faster. And by consumption, we meant, hey, there is no starter end date. It's not an a or a multiyear subscription. It is a pay-go relationship.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much for that.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Vogt of UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for squeezing me in. So, maybe this is a question for both George and Mike. When you think about sort of the product innovation engine and the new all-flash offerings versus sort of keeping your OpEx flat going forward, how should we think about sort of what you need to invest in the business as theoretically, there should be sort of a pretty steep growth rate in storage demand by some of your customers over the next couple of years? And then maybe as a quick follow-up. When you think about AI and what it means maybe for your business, how do you think about productivity gains and the uses of those productivity gains within NetApp. So does that flow through? Or is that reinvested into the business, whether it's go-to-market channels? I'm just trying to get a sense for how you think about what the benefit for AI would look like for you over the next couple of years as well? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Okay. Let me hit the sort of the broad picture, right, which is, listen, I think that we are disciplined managers of the business. We are balancing an uncertain macro with the strength of our product portfolio and the long-term opportunity. And I think what you'll see us is we continue to invest in the areas where we see the best returns so that we don't forgo the long-term health of the business. If we see the year outperform, we will certainly look at investing to further accelerate the business. But I think at this point in time, we want to be prudent in terms of managing the business just given the macro landscape. I think the second is, with regard to AI uses at NetApp, we have a broad range of users. We already use AI in our customer support and our product portfolio to help customers be able to have much reduced management requirements, right? So, we automate how data is managed in the system and automate self-healing of a system, as well as give customers intelligent chat bots, for example, so that they don't have to wait in queue for all of their basic questions. I think with regard to the big areas that we see opportunity is, is really in software development productivity. We have some exciting work already underway using some of these large language models and this profound opportunity for innovation there that we are leaning into. And you'll see the benefit of that in the ability to deliver more software to customers in a faster period of time. And I think those are some of the key areas of focus for us.\nMike Berry: And David, it's Mike. If I could add one more from a go-to-market. We've talked a lot about building the customer success team, which adds productivity because we're able to shift renewals and cross-sells and upsells and then create capacity for our core sellers. So that's another initiative over the next couple of years.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks George. Thanks Mike.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thank you. I have a cash flow question. So, I know Q1 is going to be impacted by all these strategic buys. But Mike, how are you thinking about free cash flow for the fiscal year, maybe the linearity of that? It sounds like you're expecting to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. At what point, do you think M&A will come back to be a priority? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Yes. Hey, thanks Sidney, so let's start at the top. So, we ended the year fiscal 2023 with $1.1 billion of operating cash flow. We talked about the one-time items, which was the restructuring and the Danish tax case. So, we paid out about $85 million for those two items in the quarter. So, if you add those back, you had about $1.2 billion. We would expect going into next year, I would call that kind of the floor for cash flow going into next year. Working capital then will drive whether we can do a little bit better or not. We will have some lower cash outflow in Q1 because of the incentive compensation payments. So that will help Q1. The strategic buys will start a little bit in Q1 and then they'll build in Q2 and Q3. And that largely by the end of the year, it's not a big number. So, it's more of an intra-year impact. So, -- and again, we do expect cash flow plus or minus a couple of percent, Sidney to be pretty close to non-GAAP net income than it has been historically. As it relates to our capital allocation policy, hey, it's the continuation of what we talked about last March, two March's ago, with a little bit of a tweak, going into the year, we've always said that we've spent about 70% of our free cash flow on return to shareholders and reserve, call it, 30% for acquisitions. Going into fiscal 2024, we'll over-index on share buybacks, especially in the first half. It doesn't mean that we won't do any acquisitions. There's still a pipeline, we're still looking at them. But given where we are from an execution perspective and our focus on the business, we would rather reallocate that to share purchases -- repurchases, especially in the first half, and we'll see where it goes in the second half of the year.\nSidney Ho: Okay, great. Thanks.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Louis Miscioscia of Daiwa Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay. Thank you, George. I think you had said earlier in your script that you're going to regain some all-flash array share. Maybe you could go into that in any more detail. Do you think that you did lose some share, but obviously, now with the new products coming out now in the second half that you're going to start to regain maybe if you could mention how much you think you might have lost and what you think you might be able to gain back? And then just a quick follow-up after that.\nGeorge Kurian: Louis, first of all, if you look at the recent print from our competitors, I think we took share already in the current quarter. So, that's a good start to that dynamic. I think with regard to our overall kind of focus areas, we talked about expanding innovation to support our storage business. And so we've done a lot of product-led innovation into the market as well as broad innovation in storage life cycle management programs, the simplified licensing, the industry's most advanced and complete ransomware protection and recovery guarantees of lots of service innovations as well for our customers. We have aligned our go-to-market teams starting fiscal year 2024 to be laser focused on our flash portfolio. We think we've got a strong opportunity there. Last year, as I mentioned in our Q3 call, we had a compensation plan that was complex, having our frontline sales team sell a broad array of products, and that impacted execution. We have sharpened that starting FY 2024 per our commitment, and we have brought a much more focused approach to our cloud portfolio. So, I expect us to -- we have the strongest hybrid flash portfolio in the industry. We now have the broadest capacity flash portfolio in the industry and truly the only unified storage portfolio in the industry. Unified now includes block, file, object and cloud. And so we've redefined the landscape for unified to take it to the next level. So we're excited about the portfolio. We've got to execute, and we're focused on it.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay. Then a very quick follow-up. On the guidance of down mid- to low single, what is the FX expectation for next year? I assume that you're giving guidance and actual -- what you expect revenues to perform, but I didn't know if you had an FX expectation in there.\nMike Berry: Yes. Hey, Louis, it's Mike. Our expectation is it's not going to be a big impact at all, less than 1% based on where we sit today from a revenue perspective. So, we don't think FX is going to be a big hit. And that's a small benefit where we are. Who knows where FX rates go after all of the fund that we've had with the debt ceiling and other things. So, we don't think it's going to be a big driver next year.\nLouis Miscioscia: Okay. Best of luck on the new year.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nKris Newton : Thank you, Louis. I'm going to pass it over to George for some closing remarks.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks Kris. Our focused execution yielded solid Q4 results, capping off fiscal year 2023 with record high annual operating margin and EPS, despite the slow demand environment. The fundamentals of our business model are sound and our confidence in our strategy and the health of long-term opportunity is unchanged. We will continue to prudently manage the elements within our control to drive margin expansion and improve profitability. I'm excited to enter FY 2024 with substantial new innovations and a more focused operating model to better address areas of priority spending within our customers. I look forward to updating you on our progress on next quarter's call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George and good afternoon everyone. As George noted, we are laser focused on managing the elements within our control. Our focus enabled us to deliver strong P&L performance for the full year and Q4. Before getting into the details, let me quickly highlight the key themes of our results and expectations for fiscal year 2024. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. We delivered record setting operating margin and EPS above our guidance range in both Q4 and fiscal year 2023. We will continue to prudently manage the business to position ourselves for long-term success while driving further operating margin expansion and EPS growth in fiscal year 2024. We are confident in the strength of our position and alignment to areas of priority spend. However, macro uncertainties and FX headwinds have pressured IT budgets and lowered spending. We believe these headwinds are temporary and that the spending environment will rebound in time. We reached our product gross margin target of mid-50s ahead of expectations. In fiscal year 2024, we expect to maintain product gross margin at this level and drive improvement to Public Cloud gross margin. In fiscal year 2023, we returned 148% of free cash flow to shareholders and reduced full year share count by 4% from the prior year. We plan to continue a strong policy of shareholder returns in fiscal year 2024. Now to the details. Fiscal year 2023 billings of $6.41 billion were down 4% from fiscal year 2022. Revenue of $6.36 billion was up 1% year-over-year. Adjusting for the headwind from FX, billings would have been down 1%, and revenue would have been up 4% year-over-year. Disciplined operational management yielded all-time fiscal year highs for operating margin and EPS. Operating margin was 24.2%, including a 150-basis point headwind from FX. EPS was $5.59 and included $0.57 of year over year FX headwind. Q4 billings of $1.67 billion were down 17% year-over-year, including roughly two points of FX headwind. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.58 billion, down 6% from last year or 4%, adjusting for FX. The uncertain macro negatively impacted revenue in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments, as customers continue to exhibit caution in capital expenditures and look to optimize cloud spend. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.43 billion was down 8% year-over-year. Product revenue was $744 million and down 17% from Q4 last year. Support revenue of $598 million increased 1% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited the year ahead of expectations at $620 million, up 23% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue composed 10% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 26% year-over-year to $151 million. We exited fiscal year 2023 with $4.31 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 2% year-over-year. Growth of deferred revenue is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth; Q4 marks the 21st consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth. Q4 consolidated gross margin was 69%, above our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 69%. Product gross margin was 55%, well ahead of guidance, driven by lower premiums, better mix, and lower FX headwinds. As we've described on previous calls, we expect to retain all the benefit from the reduction in premiums and will be responsive to market pricing of commodity components. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin was 66%. Q4 again highlighted the strength of our business model and our operational discipline with operating margin of 26%, an all-time quarterly high. EPS of $1.54 was comfortably above the high end of guidance and included $0.08 of year-over-year FX headwind. In Q4, cash flow from operations was $235 million and free cash flow was $196 million. Free cash flow for fiscal year 2023 of $868 million came in below expectations due to lower collections and timing of payments. As we noted on our last call, Q4 cash flow included certain one-time restructuring and tax payments, together totaling approximately $85 million. Inventory turns of 12 were steady from last quarter and last year. During Q4, we repurchased $150 million in stock and paid out $106 million in cash dividends. For the year, we repurchased a total of $850 million in stock and paid out $432 million in cash dividends, representing 148% of free cash flow. Q4 diluted share count of 217 million was down 5% year-over-year. We have approximately $400 million left on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of fiscal year 2023 and today are announcing an additional authorization of $1 billion. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We closed the year with $3.07 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now, to guidance. Let me underscore our confidence in our strategy and the strength of our position in addressing key customer priorities, like business analytics, AI, data security, and application modernization. However, we expect the macro to remain challenged, with continued pressure on IT budgets and the demand environment. As a result, we expect fiscal year 2024 total revenue to be down in the low to mid-single-digits measured on a percentage basis. Public Cloud will continue to be a positive contributor with revenue growth expected in the mid-teens. Implied in our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance is year-over-year growth in the second half driven by sales of recently introduced flash products and benefits from our go-to-market changes. While we are hopeful that the macroeconomy will improve in the second half of our fiscal year, our plans for fiscal year 2024 incorporate the environment we are seeing today and do not assume a material change to the economic or demand backdrop. We expect fiscal year 2024 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%. We believe that product margins will remain approximately 55%, supported by lower premiums and a rotation to higher margin, all-flash products. To take advantage of record low NAND prices, we have made strategic purchase commitments to lock in pricing for a large portion of our expected fiscal year 2024 SSD demand. This will help us maintain product gross margin levels when component prices rise in the future. We expect to see Public Cloud gross margin improvement in fiscal year 2024, driven by revenue scale and lower depreciation expense. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin target of 75% to 80%. We anticipate operating margins of approximately 25% and EPS of $5.65 to $5.85. Implied in this guidance is the expectation that we will hold operating expenses roughly flat versus fiscal year 2023. Fiscal year 2024 op ex includes benefits from the Q4 reduction in force, offset by annual merit increases, a reset of variable compensation, and incremental expenses to support our first in-person sales kick off and INSIGHT user conference since 2019. Operating expenses should be spread fairly evenly throughout the year. We expect a tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%. Operating cash flow will move in line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital. As we've stated before, fiscal year 2023 should be the peak for CapEx with expenditures beginning to come down in fiscal year 2024. Our healthy cash flow generation enables us to continue our strong program of capital returns to shareholders. In fiscal year 2024, we intend to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in share buybacks and dividends. We plan to hold our quarterly dividend steady at $0.50 per share throughout fiscal year 2024, with the remainder of free cash going to share buybacks. We expect the timing of buybacks to be roughly similar to fiscal year 2023, and to reduce share count by at least 2% in fiscal year 2024. Now, on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 revenue to range between $1.325 billion and $1.475 billion, which at the midpoint implies a decline of 12% year-over-year. Remember that first half fiscal year 2023 revenue, most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog from supply chain constraints, impacting the year-over-year comparisons. We expect Q1 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70% and operating margin to be approximately 20%. EPS should be in the range of $1 to $1.10. Q1 cash flow will be impacted by payments associated with SSD purchase commitments, partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments year-over-year related to our fiscal year 2023 performance. In closing, I want to echo George's appreciation of the NetApp team and their continued commitment in this uncertain environment. As I look forward into fiscal year 2024, I am confident in our strategy and our ability to continue to improve our execution and increase profitability. I'll now turn the call over to Kris for Q&A. Hey, Samik, it's Mike. If I could just add on to that and want to underline the one point George made. When we talk about our guide for 2024, when we talk about linearity, that's -- and we define that as total revenue we expect in the first half versus the second half. That's much more at where we've been historically, which is about 48% and 52% in those halves. So, when you take a look at the year-over-year growth rates in 2024, just keep in mind that those were heavily influenced by the backlog last year. So when you normalize for that, it looks like a much more normal linearity in 2024. Sure. Hey, Steven, it's Mike. So, let's do the walk from Q3 to Q4, what we guided and where we ended up. So, Q3 product margins were about 46%. We guided approximately 50% largely with the full expectation that we would continue to get relief from premiums that we've talked a lot about. And my goal is to never mention the work premium is on another call going forward. That was about 500 basis point benefit to the quarter, and we expected that to be. The two things that were incremental is mix came in better than we expected. And by that, we mean the capacity per system came in a little bit better. If you remember, in Q3, we talked about that, that caused a little bit of a reduction in gross margins as well as a little bit better all-flash margin. And then FX helped a little bit quarter-on-quarter as well. So, that's the walk from 46% to 55%. As we look into next year, we're assuming that we can retain that 55%. There's a little bit of premium benefit left, but we're also going to make sure that we are flexible as the component pricing rolls through that we can be competitive in the market. And then in addition, we also talked about, hey, we've done some strategic purchase commitments to lock in a large portion of the NAND supply for fiscal 2024 at today's prices. So, we're excited about that, being able to not have to deal with that when in the likely event it starts to go up. As we all know, NAND pricing is at an all-time fall. So, that's the walk from Q3 to Q4, how we did a little bit better and our outlook into fiscal 2024. Yes. So, thanks for the question. At this point, we don't expect any meaningful change in that business from an AR perspective or from a bookings perspective. We'll certainly watch it. We would expect this thing to have to resolve itself in the relatively near-term. At this point, we don't expect any material impact from all those discussions. Yes, Shannon. So, I'd say we actually have accelerated some of those investments. We've talked about doing CONVERGE, which is our sales conference in person as well as INSIGHT. That's the first time in three years. We do a very good job. I give the team a lot of credit for reallocating dollars internally to really -- to reallocate to growth initiatives. You've seen us react very quickly from a product perspective in the last couple of months, C-Series and other things. So, I think at this point, we feel good about where we are from an OpEx perspective. We'll see how we get through the year. And when we talk about prudently managing the business for us, it is make sure we spend the money in the right areas, but we always want to make sure we're investing in growth. And that's what you have, and that's what we put in the guide for the year. Thank you. Sure. It's Mike. So, let's take both of those. So, the guide of 55% assumes that's what we came out of Q4 with. There are some nice continued tailwinds going into next year. One is, of course, the continued shift to all-flash, which has higher margins. In addition to that, we do have a little bit of benefit from premium. So, we feel good about the 55% number. The strategic purchases really help, I'll call it hedge that number to lock the prices in that we have today. I would certainly assume given the lower price of NAND that other folks are doing similar exercises. And why we're at 55%, probably we want to make sure that we have some flexibility around pricing to your very point. So, to the extent that there are changes in the market pricing, we feel like we have that flexibility to stay within 55%, but still be able to get to our product revenue goals for the year. Yes. Hey, Nehal, it's Mike. So, if you take a look at Q4, so total revenue was down year-over-year by about 6%. Total billings were down by about 17%. When you take a look at the difference between billings and revenue, product revenue and product billings are basically the same because there is no change in deferred. What we saw in the second half, especially in Q4, is lower product bookings than correlated with less support bookings, specifically multiyear bookings that come with new sales. So, we do expect to see that come back as we go through next year. That's going to be the difference that you see in billings and revenue. So based on the guidance for the year, which is revenue down low to mid-single-digit percent, we do expect billings to be more flat to somewhere around plus or minus a couple of percentage points to do a little bit better than revenue, again, because of the contribution from support. Thank you. Hey Simon, it's Mike. So, we'll do those two ways. We've given this detail in the past. So, cloud storage represents approximately 60% of the total cloud ARR. CloudOps represents about 40%. It stayed amazingly consistent through fiscal 2023. If you then look at what is consumption versus subscription, consumption is going to more than half of the business, and it's growing faster than subscription because the two products that are growing the fastest that George referenced, ANf and FSx, which are our first-party cloud storage products are consumption-based. So, you should expect to see that percentage of consumption continue to climb as we go through 2024. And then it doesn't mean that subscription is declining. It means that the consulting business is growing faster. And by consumption, we meant, hey, there is no starter end date. It's not an a or a multiyear subscription. It is a pay-go relationship. Thank you. And David, it's Mike. If I could add one more from a go-to-market. We've talked a lot about building the customer success team, which adds productivity because we're able to shift renewals and cross-sells and upsells and then create capacity for our core sellers. So that's another initiative over the next couple of years. Yes. Hey, thanks Sidney, so let's start at the top. So, we ended the year fiscal 2023 with $1.1 billion of operating cash flow. We talked about the one-time items, which was the restructuring and the Danish tax case. So, we paid out about $85 million for those two items in the quarter. So, if you add those back, you had about $1.2 billion. We would expect going into next year, I would call that kind of the floor for cash flow going into next year. Working capital then will drive whether we can do a little bit better or not. We will have some lower cash outflow in Q1 because of the incentive compensation payments. So that will help Q1. The strategic buys will start a little bit in Q1 and then they'll build in Q2 and Q3. And that largely by the end of the year, it's not a big number. So, it's more of an intra-year impact. So, -- and again, we do expect cash flow plus or minus a couple of percent, Sidney to be pretty close to non-GAAP net income than it has been historically. As it relates to our capital allocation policy, hey, it's the continuation of what we talked about last March, two March's ago, with a little bit of a tweak, going into the year, we've always said that we've spent about 70% of our free cash flow on return to shareholders and reserve, call it, 30% for acquisitions. Going into fiscal 2024, we'll over-index on share buybacks, especially in the first half. It doesn't mean that we won't do any acquisitions. There's still a pipeline, we're still looking at them. But given where we are from an execution perspective and our focus on the business, we would rather reallocate that to share purchases -- repurchases, especially in the first half, and we'll see where it goes in the second half of the year. Thank you. Yes. Hey, Louis, it's Mike. Our expectation is it's not going to be a big impact at all, less than 1% based on where we sit today from a revenue perspective. So, we don't think FX is going to be a big hit. And that's a small benefit where we are. Who knows where FX rates go after all of the fund that we've had with the debt ceiling and other things. So, we don't think it's going to be a big driver next year. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks Kris. Welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter FY 23 call. Our Q4 results reflect solid execution in the face of ongoing macroeconomic challenges. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our guidance, with disciplined operational management yielding all-time high quarterly operating margin and EPS above expectations. For FY 23, we delivered record high annual operating margin and EPS, despite the slow demand environment and relatively flat revenue from FY 22. Even as customers are tightening their budgets in response to the macro, they are not stopping investments in applications and technologies that drive business productivity and growth. Digital transformation projects involving business analytics, AI, data security, and application modernization, both on premises and in the cloud remain top priorities for IT organizations. This drives our confidence in the health of our markets and future growth opportunity, despite the temporary macro headwinds. We are participating in the areas of priority spending with a modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure and data management. By providing customers with the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security, and sustainability, we increase our relevance and value. And we continue to introduce new innovations to deliver greater customer value, further strengthening our position. On our last call, I outlined our three areas of focus to sharpen our execution to better deliver results, while at the same time, positioning ourselves for long-term success. As a reminder, the focus areas are: remain prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts across the company in support of our storage systems business, and build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. As you can see from our Q4 and FY 2023 results, we have demonstrated success in managing the elements within our control and staying flexible to adapt to the ever changing environment. We remain committed to maintaining operational discipline as we move through FY 2024, adjusting as appropriate, to drive operating margin expansion and EPS growth while also continuing to invest for the long-term. Turning to our storage systems business. Q4 Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.4 billion was down 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Our all-flash array business decreased 4% from Q4 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.1 billion. Similar to Q3, headwinds from large enterprises weighed on our product and AFA revenue. As you've seen, we are reinvigorating our storage portfolio, innovating to deliver greater customer value, reach new customers, and better address areas of priority spending and market growth. ONTAP AI and FlexPod AI are proven and tested reference architectures to help speed and simplify AI deployments. These solutions are designed around our all-flash arrays which are uniquely suited to meet the performance, multiprotocol, and data mobility demands of AI workloads. In Q4, we demonstrated industry leading performance in the GPU Direct benchmark, proof of our ability to enable customers to use the full power of GPU technology for AI. Our affinity to AI use cases doesn't stop at performance; ONTAP includes native data management tools that streamline workflows for data science teams and integrate multi-platform, multi-site, and multi-cloud data pipelines. With new performance and data management features planned in upcoming ONTAP releases, we expect to raise the bar again not just for performance but for total workflow solutions that help companies realize the benefits of AI faster and with better results. The new AFF C-series, our comprehensive portfolio of QLC-based all-flash arrays, began shipping late in Q4. We are very pleased with the initial customer response. In addition to lots of quoting activity, we closed a good number of deals in the fourth quarter. One of our early C-series wins was a $15 million deal at a large financial institution for business-critical workloads in its cloud-ready, service-level defined environment. We beat the competition with a solution that was significantly denser and more energy efficient. Following this highly successful launch, we introduced the NetApp ASA A-series early in Q1. The ASA is a new line of SAN-specific flash storage systems that deliver high levels of performance, scalability, data availability, efficiency, and cloud connectivity with up to 50% lower power consumption and associated carbon emissions than competitive offerings. The ASA complements our unified storage offerings to address block-only use cases, while avoiding the operational and data siloes of competitors' products. We are also innovating to improve the customer experience. In Q4, we introduced NetApp Advance, a portfolio of programs bringing predictability and adaptability, including the Storage Lifecycle Program for non-disruptive storage upgrades. At the start of Q1, we announced ONTAP One, a simple way to buy and consume all the native software capabilities of ONTAP. We're enhancing the value of these built-in capabilities with our Ransomware Recovery Guarantee, which leverages ONTAP's unique combination of key built-in security and ransomware protection features to detect, stop, and recover from ransomware attacks in real-time. In addition to delivering significant innovation, we have also rebalanced our go-to-market efforts, including focusing our broad sales organization on selling flash through compensation plans and reinstituting a specialist sales team for cloud. We believe these actions will allow the team to better address the large storage TAM. Entering FY 2024, I am confident that these actions will enable us to drive product revenue growth and regain share in the all-flash array market. We are seeing early, positive signs, but the full benefit of these changes will take time to develop and should be a driver for product revenue growth in the second half. While we are sharpening our attack on the storage market, we are not taking our eye off the Public Cloud opportunity. Public Cloud ARR of $620 million was up 23% year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, driven by strength in Public Cloud storage services. Our Public Cloud business in Q4 was backend loaded, resulting in softer revenue and lower DBNRR than our ARR results would indicate. Public Cloud revenue for Q4 was $151 million and DBNRR was 114%. Our Public Cloud Services are highly differentiated, with a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors and they create customer preference for NetApp. The number of total cloud customers, customers using multiple of our Public Cloud services, and customers with greater than $500,000 of revenue in the quarter, all continue to grow nicely. While, like our cloud partners, we see continued cloud optimizations, some of the customers whose optimizations created significant headwinds for us in FY 2023 have kicked off new projects that we expect to scale over the next 18 months. We believe that our first-party storage services, branded and sold by our cloud partners, represent our biggest opportunity. We have aligned our sales specialist resources to our cloud partners' customer segmentation and go-to-market structure to tighten our alignment to and improve our execution against this opportunity. Over the course of FY 2024, we will scale our customer success team to further improve customer retention and expansion and develop a more focused cloud channel model. Cloud operations remains an important market for us, and we have dedicated go-to-market resources to address this opportunity. We have not wavered in our conviction that Public Cloud services has the potential to be a multibillion-dollar ARR business for us. While the shift to cloud is experiencing an industry-wide slowdown, the long-term trend in favor of cloud is unchanged. In conclusion, while FY 2023 was not the year we expected at its outset, our disciplined management enabled us to overcome a number of headwinds to deliver all-time high operating margin and EPS. The fundamentals of our business model are sound and our confidence in our strategy and the health of long-term opportunity is unchanged. We are entering fiscal year 2024 with substantially more innovation and a new, more focused operating model to attack the areas of priority spending. In this uncertain environment, we will remain agile and continue to be disciplined stewards of the business. We believe our actions will drive margin expansion and earnings growth while yielding top line growth in the back half of the year. Thank you to the NetApp team for their dedication and focus. I am pleased with our progress, but we recognize our work is not done. We look forward to building on this momentum and driving long-term value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Broadly speaking, the Q4 demand environment was not substantially different from what we saw in Q3, and our plans for next year contemplate continuation of the same environment. We talked about in the cloud segment, some of the larger customers who had significantly optimized their landscape through the course of the prior quarters began to take on the projects that we anticipated them taking on. These projects take some time to ramp. We also saw strength in new customer additions and the number of customers that were using multiple products from NetApp, so all good signs for future revenue growth. That being said, customers on a broad basis, still cautious about spending and particularly in the large enterprise segment. I think broadly speaking, we are super excited about the recent portfolio introductions we've made. We've seen the benefits of improved focus in our field organization. It takes a few quarters to build. And I think if you look at the pattern of sequential linearity through next fiscal year, it is similar to what we have seen in more traditional years. I think FY 2023 was a bit anomalous. And so we feel good about the progress through the year. I think with regard to the macro, we are not -- we've built our plan assuming the macro stays the same. Clearly, if there's upside to the macro, that should be a benefit to us over the course of the year. Listen, I think, first of all, we are very pleased with new customer acquisition, the broadening of our workloads, clearly the performance, and the efficiency and multiprotocol capability of our storage is an advantage whether for AI workloads, whether they are on-premises or in Public Cloud. What we've seen in Public Cloud for AI is a lot of data science teams using the prebuilt tools that are available on the Public Cloud to calibrate and get their learning models of the curve quickly. And that's uniquely available with NetApp. I think with regard to our perspective for the full year, listen, cloud storage, especially the storage that's sold alongside the hyperscalers will be the primary driver of our business next year. I think if you look at the total dollars in any given year, the opportunity to expand existing customers is substantially larger than the amount that new customers contribute because they are just small, but we feel good about the pace of new customer acquisition. And now our installed base of cloud customers is very substantial. So, there's a good opportunity to cross-sell and upsell them more capabilities. Yes. So, let me get the two questions. The first one is what we've seen in the cloud environment is that customers are still progressing new workload deployment, meaning new applications, analytics environment, AIML environment and so on, right, and that has not slowed down. I think there was a period of time where customers were monitoring their environments and optimizing the infrastructure, but the new deployments continue. I think where we have seen people being more cautious is about migration of on-premises environments, for example, to Public Cloud, where they are benchmarking the total cost of each of those landscapes. We have a large and growing opportunity in public cloud on new workloads because of the capabilities and the certifications that we continue to bring. And so we're excited about that opportunity. I think with regard to the customer we mentioned, they were not using NetApp for the landscape that we won. We won -- we replaced a competitive environment, and we did so based on the new C-Series products that had a significant advantage over all the competitive products, both in terms of our traditional advantages around multiprotocol and all of the data management features, but we're also substantially more efficient from a power consumption and density standpoint. Thank you. The CloudOps business was relatively flat sequentially. There were new customer additions and some optimizations within existing customers. The majority of the growth rate sequentially from Q3 to Q4 was driven by cloud storage, especially the consumption business with our cloud provider partners. Yes. We have done exceptionally well in the analytics, AI, deep learning environments. We have both technology leadership across multi-protocol, high-performance, scale-out storage and multi-cloud, which are super important buckets of what customers need to drive these analytic applications. And we have done -- we've doubled our business this past year to a very significant amount. I think the key use cases are business problems around, for example, in financial services, sentiment analysis, recommendation engines, advanced recommendations engines and e-commerce, precision medicine, cross-department clinical AI solutions. And then even last quarter, we had a substantial win in a new form of metaverse around autonomous driving, right? So, these are advanced analytics engines that are being deployed on very large-scale data sets. They typically require file and object and cloud integration. And today's environments are not the advanced LLM model, the majority of the business we see today are really around re-platforming from Hadoop to more modern environments as well as the use of advanced neural networks. We see the impending onslaught of ChatGPT and tools like that, where customers will take the OpenAI or open source generative AI model, but then build it on top of their own data sets, which require the storage that we have. So, we're excited about the future, and we have real strong performance in our AI and analytics business today. I think the AI applications that drive business productivity are a topic of discussion in every CEO room around the globe because it is a key way to bring speed and operating efficiency to companies. And so many of the applications that we talked about help transform a company's business model. And so they will get prioritized in spending envelopes and we are really excited about our opportunity to capitalize on that. We have done the work not only to build high-performance storage, but in addition, build the integrations into all of the AI and data science tool chains that are common in the world and to enable a really flexible data pipeline that can start in the cloud where the tools are available, but then can be operated at a scale on the data in your data center. So, we're really excited about what the future holds and we're going to keep pushing forward. I see cloud and I see AI as two big opportunities for NetApp. We are super well positioned in both, and we look to take advantage of both of them going forward. I think the lower cost NAND technology that we've introduced in our products will become a bigger part of our business through the course of fiscal year 2024 and will be the biggest part of the flash storage growth rate in the industry over the next two or three years. These HDD replacement cycles are multiyear, right? I think if you saw the high-performance 15,000 HDD segment, it took multiple years to transition that footprint. And so 10,000, which is an even bigger part of the market will take many years to transition. But we're excited about our offerings, the start that we've had and the opportunity over the next many years. I think it's premature to signal that cloud optimization is behind us. As we commented in our prepared remarks, I think that this customers will continue to manage their spend where that is on data center infrastructure or on public cloud. I think what we continue to see is the projects and applications that drive business performance especially core business growth are getting prioritized and invested. Those could be analytics, those could be AI, those could be digital manufacturing projects and on and on, right? I think where we have seen optimization and some amount of caution is in migration of enterprise workloads from data centers, the old lift and shift, I think people are taking a hard look at benchmarking both environments, whether it's public cloud or on-premises. So I think that's where we continue to see some optimization. In the plan for 2024, the real focus is on accelerating our hyperscaler storage. The storage that is sold alongside our cloud providers, it had a good quarter this quarter. We are uniquely positioned in the market, and we are serving a wider and wider range of applications with the strength of our technology. So, we're excited about that. Yes. So, maybe I can start with the portfolio. We've introduced three major expansions of our portfolio in the all-flash segment over the last four months to five months. We have capacity flash, the broadest, most feature-rich, most competitive capacity flash products in the industry. We've announced a set of entry flash products that are shipping, which brings our industry-leading software in an all-flash configuration at a price point that is perfect for midsized enterprises. And we introduced early this quarter and All SAN Array, which is a block-only storage configuration for customers that have large block storage environment and don't want to use unified storage for those offerings. So, major expansion to our product portfolio, the most significant expansion since we introduced our flash portfolio many years ago. So, I'm excited about that. That gives us opportunity to both expand wallet share in enterprise customers going after parts of the wallet that we used to not serve, but importantly, address the expanding opportunity within commercial customers. Our commercial segment has outperformed the enterprise segment throughout this fiscal year and again did so in Q4, representing the resilience of those customers to the macro spending environment. So, we feel good about that. We moved some resources within our spending envelope. We reprioritized some more resources to cover the commercial market for fiscal year 2024. Okay. Let me hit the sort of the broad picture, right, which is, listen, I think that we are disciplined managers of the business. We are balancing an uncertain macro with the strength of our product portfolio and the long-term opportunity. And I think what you'll see us is we continue to invest in the areas where we see the best returns so that we don't forgo the long-term health of the business. If we see the year outperform, we will certainly look at investing to further accelerate the business. But I think at this point in time, we want to be prudent in terms of managing the business just given the macro landscape. I think the second is, with regard to AI uses at NetApp, we have a broad range of users. We already use AI in our customer support and our product portfolio to help customers be able to have much reduced management requirements, right? So, we automate how data is managed in the system and automate self-healing of a system, as well as give customers intelligent chat bots, for example, so that they don't have to wait in queue for all of their basic questions. I think with regard to the big areas that we see opportunity is, is really in software development productivity. We have some exciting work already underway using some of these large language models and this profound opportunity for innovation there that we are leaning into. And you'll see the benefit of that in the ability to deliver more software to customers in a faster period of time. And I think those are some of the key areas of focus for us. Louis, first of all, if you look at the recent print from our competitors, I think we took share already in the current quarter. So, that's a good start to that dynamic. I think with regard to our overall kind of focus areas, we talked about expanding innovation to support our storage business. And so we've done a lot of product-led innovation into the market as well as broad innovation in storage life cycle management programs, the simplified licensing, the industry's most advanced and complete ransomware protection and recovery guarantees of lots of service innovations as well for our customers. We have aligned our go-to-market teams starting fiscal year 2024 to be laser focused on our flash portfolio. We think we've got a strong opportunity there. Last year, as I mentioned in our Q3 call, we had a compensation plan that was complex, having our frontline sales team sell a broad array of products, and that impacted execution. We have sharpened that starting FY 2024 per our commitment, and we have brought a much more focused approach to our cloud portfolio. So, I expect us to -- we have the strongest hybrid flash portfolio in the industry. We now have the broadest capacity flash portfolio in the industry and truly the only unified storage portfolio in the industry. Unified now includes block, file, object and cloud. And so we've redefined the landscape for unified to take it to the next level. So we're excited about the portfolio. We've got to execute, and we're focused on it. Thanks Kris. Our focused execution yielded solid Q4 results, capping off fiscal year 2023 with record high annual operating margin and EPS, despite the slow demand environment. The fundamentals of our business model are sound and our confidence in our strategy and the health of long-term opportunity is unchanged. We will continue to prudently manage the elements within our control to drive margin expansion and improve profitability. I'm excited to enter FY 2024 with substantial new innovations and a more focused operating model to better address areas of priority spending within our customers. I look forward to updating you on our progress on next quarter's call."

During the call all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In Q3, we executed well on the elements under our control in the face of a weakening IT spending environment and continued cloud cost optimization. Disciplined operational management yielded operating margin and EPS that exceeded expectations, despite revenue coming in at the low end of our guidance. We are delivering on our commitments and responding to the dynamic environment. We adjusted our cost structure, introduced a portfolio of capacity-flash arrays to support cost sensitive customers, and continue to work with our customers to help them optimize their cloud spending. On today\u2019s call, I will discuss our Q3 results in the context of the current environment and our plans to sharpen our execution to accelerate near-term results and enhance our long-term position. We continued to see increased budget scrutiny, requiring higher level approvals, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles, and some deals pushing out. We are feeling this most acutely in large enterprise and the Americas tech and service provider sectors. Customers are looking to stretch their budget dollars, sweating assets, shifting spend to hybrid flash and capacity flash arrays from higher-cost performance flash arrays and, as our cloud partners have described, optimizing cloud spending. We saw signs of a softening environment early in fiscal year \u201823 and took swift action to control costs, with increased scrutiny of program spending, a hiring slowdown in Q2, and a hiring freeze in Q3. At the start of Q4, we implemented a workforce reduction of approximately 8%. Decisions that impact our employees are always difficult. I take great pride in fostering the NetApp culture and am committed to using this difficult action to refocus our team, guided by the values and mission of the Company. Our hybrid flash and QLC-based all-flash arrays continue to perform well, benefiting from customers\u2019 price sensitivity in this challenging macro. The shift from high-performance all-flash arrays to lower cost solutions, coupled with the lower spending environment, especially among large enterprise, and U.S. tech and service provider customers who are large consumers of flash, created headwinds to our product and all-flash array revenues. In Q3, our all-flash array business decreased 12% from Q3 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. Public Cloud ARR of $605 million did not meet our expectations, driven by a shortfall in cloud storage as a result of the same factors we experienced last quarter. Spending optimization and the winding down of project-based workloads like chip design, EDA, and HPC were headwinds again in Q3. We have a sizable base of public cloud customers, with a number of large customers who have grown rapidly over the past year and are now optimizing. Their cost optimizations mask the growth of other customers. We continue to add new customers and churn has remained consistently low. Overall, the CloudOps portfolio performed to plan. Cloud Insights has stabilized, and Spot continues to grow nicely, benefiting from the cost optimization trend. Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate decreased to 120% but is still within healthy industry norms. We are confident that we remain well positioned to take advantage of the secular growth trends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We are aligned to customers\u2019 top priorities and have demonstrated success in controlling the elements within our control. Building on that solid foundation, we are sharpening our execution to accelerate near-term results while strengthening our position for when the spending environment rebounds. We have three areas of focus: First, we will remain prudent stewards of the business and will continue to tightly manage the elements within our control. Second, we are reinvigorating efforts across the Company in support of our storage business. Third, we are building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. Starting with the first area of focus, remaining prudent stewards of the business and managing the elements within our control. We will maintain our focus on cost controls so that expenses do not grow ahead of revenue. We will achieve this by maintaining our scrutiny on program spending and hiring, as well as focusing our investments on the products that represent the biggest opportunity. We\u2019ve made difficult decisions to reduce investment in products with smaller revenue potential like Astra Data Store and SolidFire. The results of this focus are visible in our ability to maintain our free cash flow, operating margin, and EPS guidance despite lower revenue. On to the second focus area, reinvigorating our storage business. As we moved rapidly to embrace cloud, we lost some momentum in our Hybrid Cloud business. We are taking decisive action to strengthen our position and performance by better addressing the areas of market growth, delivering more customer value, and realigning our go-to-market activities to better address this opportunity. We were slow to fully embrace the customer desire for lower-cost, capacity-oriented all-flash systems. At the start of Q4, we rectified that situation with the introduction of the AFF C-Series, the most comprehensive, industry-leading portfolio of QLC-based all-flash arrays that addresses a wide range of workloads and price points. These products will help customers manage through a cost sensitive environment while, at the same time, supporting their pursuit of sustainability targets. Initial response has been very positive, and we are already quoting deals for customers. The AFF C-Series will drive AFA revenue and support product gross margin as customers rotate from lower margin hybrid flash to all-flash systems. In addition to expanding our product portfolio, we\u2019ve introduced a number of innovations to improve the customer experience and bring predictability to their investment process. In Q3, we released BlueXP, a unified control plane that helps decrease resource waste, complexity, and the risk of managing diverse environments. As a part of our sustainability commitment, we\u2019re previewing a new dashboard in BlueXP to help customers understand their data center carbon footprint across environments. Early in Q4, we introduced NetApp Advance, a best-in-class portfolio of programs and guarantees, which is already helping us win new customers and drive revenue. We are rebalancing our sales and marketing efforts to better address the significant storage market opportunity, including aligning compensation plans to drive sales of our reinvigorated storage portfolio. We believe that these actions will enable us to drive product revenue growth and regain share in the all-flash array market. Finally, our third area of focus, building a more focused approach to cloud. While we are reinvigorating our storage business, we have no intention of taking our foot off the pedal in Public Cloud. It represents a huge growth opportunity for us with a gross margin profile that is accretive to the business. Additionally, our Public Cloud Services are highly differentiated, with a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors, and create customer preference for NetApp. We have sharpened the focus in our CloudOps portfolio and have taken actions that could have future revenue and ARR implications. We believe that our CloudOps services will continue to deliver stable, steady growth over the long term. Our customer success team has made good progress in driving utilization of our CloudOps services, but we need to do more with our cloud storage and data services. Additionally, we recognize that we have not been using our go-to-market resources to their best effect here. In addition to refocusing our sales team on the reinvigorated storage portfolio, we are identifying ways to most effectively align our sales resources to the buying centers and consumption models for all our solutions. Our cloud storage business is predominately consumption-based and largely driven by our hyperscaler partners. These factors, coupled with the current cloud cost-optimization environment have impacted our ability to forecast ARR. However, as we grow the business, the impact from a subset of customers will be mitigated, smoothing its growth and improving predictability. I want to underscore my confidence in this opportunity. The migration of enterprise applications, like SAP and VMware, to the cloud, as well as cloud-native applications, like artificial intelligence, create a massive market in which we can grow. We believe strongly that Public Cloud services can be a multibillion-dollar ARR business for us. However, achieving that target will take longer than we initially planned due to the industry-wide slowdown in cloud spending and our recent performance. In closing, we have seen tangible success from our efforts to manage the elements within our control in a challenging environment. Despite our lowered revenue outlook, we have preserved free cash flow and EPS expectations. In the first three fiscal quarters of this year, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders and reduced share count by 4%. We are sharpening our execution to accelerate near-term results and enhance our position for the long-term. We are taking these steps now, so that, as we begin FY24, we are in a new, more focused operating model to attack the opportunity ahead, drive growth, and deliver shareholder value. Before turning the call over to Mike, I want to give my thanks to the NetApp team for their operational discipline and rapid response to set us up for better results. I have seen first-hand how hard they are working to navigate the challenging environment and I really appreciate their efforts.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to reiterate the key themes for today\u2019s discussion that George highlighted. Number one, despite the temporary headwinds to revenue, our disciplined operational management yielded op margin and EPS above the high-end of guidance. Number two, the macro backdrop and demand environment continue to be major headwinds. The weakening IT spending environment was most pronounced in our large enterprise and U.S. technology and service provider customers and materially impacted our all-flash revenue in Q3, while significant cloud optimization across all three major hyperscalers continued to weigh heavily on ARR growth. Although the U.S. dollar weakened slightly during Q3, FX continues to be a material headwind to our financial results on a year-over-year basis. Number three, as we navigate through this fluid demand environment, we remain laser focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation. Towards this end, we took swift action in Q3 to control costs through increased program spending scrutiny and a hiring freeze. And at the start of Q4, we implemented a reduction in force of approximately 8%. In addition to adjusting our own cost structure, we also introduced C-Series, a portfolio of QLC capacity-flash arrays to support cost sensitive datacenter customers, and we continued to work with our cloud customers to help optimize their spending. And number four, as a result of our disciplined cost management, we are reiterating our full-year EPS guide of $5.30 to $5.50. We are also confident in our free cash flow target of $1.1 billion, adjusting for the restructuring and one-time cash tax payment in Q4. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of fiscal \u201823 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Now to the details. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Q3 billings were $1.57 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 340 basis-point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been down 7% and 2% year-over-year, respectively. Even with the challenging Q3, our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall revenue growth profile of NetApp. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.38 billion was down 9% year-over-year. Product revenue of $682 million decreased 19% year-over-year, as customers took a decidedly cautious approach to capital spending. Total Q3 recurring support revenue of $616 million increased 5% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q3 at $605 million, up 29% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $150 million, up 36% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. As highlighted by our three major hyperscaler partners, customers continue to optimize their cloud spend as organizations are exercising caution, given the macroeconomic uncertainty. While the timing of the recovery remains unclear, we are confident the secular trends of AI, machine learning, IoT and high-performance computing, along with the migration of enterprise apps like VMware & SAP, will drive long-term growth in cloud storage consumption. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $766 million was up 10% year-over-year, constituting 50% of total revenue. We ended Q3 with $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q3 marks the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 67% in Q3, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 67% in Q3. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 46.5%, including a 2-point year-over-year headwind from FX. As noted, our large enterprise and U.S. tech and service provider customers have continued to reduce CapEx spend as they right-size their spending envelops. These customers are the most forward leaning technology adopters and the biggest consumers of all-flash systems in the economy, and their pause in CapEx spending has had a material impact on our total revenue, all-flash mix and product margins. And while the supply chain component premiums and NAND pricing notably improved in Q3, we had to work through higher-cost inventory during the quarter. We expect the improving supply chain and NAND pricing to be a tailwind to product margin in Q4 and fiscal \u201824. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 69% was accretive to the corporate average for the ninth consecutive quarter. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as the business scales and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. While revenue came in at the low-end of guidance, Q3 highlighted our operational discipline and cost controls, with operating margin of 24%, including 2-points of FX headwinds. EPS of $1.37 came in above the high-end of guidance and included $0.14 of year-over-year FX headwind. Cash flow from operations was $377 million and free cash flow was $319 million. Inventory turns increased to 12 in Q3, up from 9 in Q2, as supply chain challenges eased in the quarter, enabling us to take down inventory by nearly $70 million sequentially. During Q3, we repurchased $200 million in stock and paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $308 million to shareholders, representing 97% of free cash flow. Share count of 219 million was down 4% year-over-year. We closed Q3 with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, up $108 million sequentially. Now to guidance. As George discussed, we have seen continued softening in the macro backdrop, with customers taking a decidedly cautious approach to spending. We now expect fiscal \u201923 revenue to be roughly flat year-over-year, which includes 3 to 4 percentage points of FX headwind. In fiscal \u201823, we continue to expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and FX headwinds weigh on product margins. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time, particularly when you factor in our new C-Series portfolio, which will largely displace lower margin hybrid spinning disk systems in our product mix. Given our disciplined cost controls, we are raising our fiscal \u201823 operating margin guidance. We now expect op margin to range between 23% and 24%, which includes approximately 2 points of FX headwind. Last quarter, we committed to protecting both, EPS and free cash flow during this uncertain macro environment. Today, we are reiterating our full-year EPS guide of $5.30 to $5.50, which includes $0.54 of currency impacts. We also continue to expect to generate $1.1 billion in free cash flow, excluding one-time items. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of fiscal \u201923 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Now on to Q4 guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.475 billion and $1.625 billion which, at the midpoint, implies an 8% decrease year-over-year, or a 6% decrease in constant currency. In this macro environment, we expect customers to continue to optimize their cloud spend at our three major hyperscaler partners. As a result, we expect cloud revenue and ARR to be approximately flat sequentially in Q4. Please note, as we head into fiscal \u201824, we plan to anchor our cloud segment guidance on revenue dollars, instead of ARR. To be clear, we will continue to disclose cloud ARR as a key metric as we go through the year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67%. As we head into Q4, we are forecasting a material reduction in component premiums, decreasing NAND costs, and engineering product efficiencies. As such, we are confident that product margins will rise in Q4. These trends also position us nicely heading into fiscal \u201824 to drive leverage through our business model, particularly as customers begin to reengage on all-flash capacity buildouts and customers mix shift away from hybrid spinning disk systems to new QLC all-flash solutions. While the exact timing is unclear, large enterprise and U.S. tech and service provider customers are the largest consumers of data and storage in the global economy and our all-flash ONTAP systems are structurally linked to their data growth cross cycle. In Q4, we expect operating margin to range between 23% and 24%. We anticipate our tax-rate to be approximately 21%. We are forecasting earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.30 and $1.40 per share. Assumed in our Q4 guidance is net interest income of $7.5 million and a share count of approximately 218 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment in such an uncertain economic environment. I\u2019ll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks Mike. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I had was if I think about the delta and cloud ARR from $700 million last quarter that we were expecting to maybe $605 million range right now, how much of the delta or the drop, if you may, is due to macro issues versus something that might be more company-specific? Is there a way to parse that out? And then do you see the resumption of growth happening in '24 as you go forward?\nGeorge Kurian: I think the broad themes that we saw were shared across all of the hyperscalers and across a broad range of customers. We continue to see good numbers of new customer additions to our cloud storage offerings. Even though the impact in the quarter from there being acquired is lower, we had -- we saw no changes to the churn in our cloud storage business, but we did see optimization, meaning movement of capacity from higher cost, more high-performance levels to lower cost, lower performance levels. And there was no predictable pattern in terms of what types of customers. As we noted last quarter, we also saw some reductions in spending from customers who wrapped up projects with us. So, I will just say this is part of normal cloud behavior and consumption. We feel good about the additions. We feel good about our engagement with customers. And we feel good about the fact that we continue to broaden the number of use cases and customer value propositions we can address that should benefit us moving forward with a more focused route-to-market approach for cloud as well.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And could I spend maybe 60 seconds on the gross margin dynamics into April quarter? I think you\u2019re essentially saying, I think, gross margins are flat, up 20 basis points sequentially, but that's despite the fact you have a little bit of revenue leverage. And then it sounds like NAND pricing and commodity pricing broadly is coming down. So, I would have thought gross margins could be up a bit more maybe in the April quarter. So maybe you can just talk about the puts and takes on the gross margin line, that'd be super helpful. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Sure. Amit, it's Mike. So, I'll do both, Hybrid Cloud just in a little bit of cloud margins as well. So on Hybrid Cloud, what we really saw was if you go back to the two big drivers that we saw in the business, one is with our lower spending in U.S. strategic large enterprise. They are the largest purveyors of all-flash. So, we saw all-flash dollar and mix come down. In addition, we've talked about seeing lower capacity, i.e., folks buying less terabytes per system. That happened within both, flash and hybrid. So, those two added together brought our margins down in Q3. We didn't really see a benefit on NAND or premiums yet. This is hopefully the last time I'm going to say this on a call because we fully expect in Q4 that to finally start to realize in the P&L, we will see the benefits of a lot lower premiums. And finally, the lower cost NAND as we work through the inventory will roll through the P&L. So, we feel good about the gross margin projection in the April quarter being at least 50%. And then cloud margins, hey, it's really dependent more than anything on scale. We feel good about getting to the mid-70s as we scale that business, but we do need to drive higher revenue. So hopefully, that helps.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Maybe, George, I just want to go back to your comment that you mentioned that you lost some momentum in Hybrid Cloud. Just wanted to drill down on that comment. Can you maybe elaborate on a little bit more specifically, what did you mean by that? Obviously, it's a key driver of the business and an important cash flow engine, but just would love to get some more color on that. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think there are three elements of that. I think the first, we have been a little bit later than we would have liked to introduce lower cost more value-oriented capacity flash arrays. We've corrected that. We feel really good about the early interest in our C-Series. The second was that we have moved resources to the more stable, steady growth parts of the market, like the commercial market and lower parts of the enterprise from the cyclical large enterprise segment. We haven't done as much as we need to, and we'll continue to do that heading forward. And the third is that from a compensation and goal alignment perspective, we're going to sharply focus certain parts of our field organization to drive our flash portfolio while aligning other parts of our field organization to focus on the cloud business.\nDavid Vogt: Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up to that is, so typically, what is the lead time, or how does the cycle -- or the sales cycle work from, let's say, start to traction for these initiatives? Should we expect sort of a recovery in, let's say, the second half of fiscal '24 in these particular markets driven by the strategy, or does it take a little bit longer or maybe shorter to see some tangible benefits? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think, first of all, we are excited about the C-Series products. They will be available this quarter. I think the material impact of those product portfolios will be in the first half of next fiscal year. The large enterprise segment will continue to be a place of caution for us. I think that we will need -- we are working with our customers to understand their buying behavior. My sense is that -- and my hope is that they are back buying more aggressively than they have been in the second part of next fiscal year. So, we hope that -- the product portfolio is in the market this quarter. Commercial and lower-end parts of the enterprise should see some benefits from that in the first half of next fiscal year. But the large enterprise segment, we're a bit more cautious about. And your expectation is more accurate around second half of next fiscal year is our hope.\nOperator: Next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Just following up on those last comments around the commercial versus large enterprise. I guess, how do we think about just sort of a pivot back so that you prepared for the cycle? Like what are you looking for in order to maybe have the right resources ready for when the large enterprises do come back and you need to be prepared to service them in a more aggressive manner? And then, I had a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: We are very closely engaged with these customers. We've known them for decades. I think the fundamental pattern is the improvements in their business prospects. So, as soon as they see that, they start the discussions with us on purchasing.\nSteven Fox: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of the benefits now with NAND and other component costs low, can you just talk about -- give us a sense for how much of your sales are benefiting from the low-cost NAND in this current quarter? And how much more there would be to go before you like at 100% of where NAND prices are? Thanks.\nMike Berry: So this quarter, on the low cost NAND it's not a big number, Steve, in this quarter. We do expect that that will be a significant contributor going into fiscal '24. I would just say, take a step back on the margin side. There are two significant drivers to our optimism as we look at product margins in '24. One is the premiums. We've talked about that. It's about $50 million a quarter. It is a material improvement going into next year. NAND, as we all know, has come down materially every quarter since in the last three quarters. We're finally going to be able to realize in our P&L as we got -- as we move through the high-cost inventory. And then you talked about the mix, that will also benefit product margins going into next year. And then goodness, hopefully, FX also helped. So, I would add all four of those together when you look at product margins in fiscal '24.\nOperator: The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: It sounds like you were impacted by both share and weaker demand in all-flash. Is that correct? And is the share loss because of product gap that you are now filling with AFFC? It just seems like a large decline coming just from the low end of the AFF market? So any color there would be helpful. And I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: I think that our exposure to the large tech and service provider segments and our large market share in markets like Germany exposed us when those segments and countries slowed down in their purchasing behavior. I think that having a smaller number of QLC products also precluded us from participating in some purchasing activities, some RFPs in the past couple of quarters. And I think we are excited about the return to having the best lineup of flash, both performance and capacity flash. And we've got to see progress in terms of -- continued progress in our enterprise and commercial customers over the next few quarters to wait for the large enterprise purchasing to come back.\nWamsi Mohan: And you're exiting this year with somewhat worsening momentum given the macro from down 2% constant currency in Q3 to guiding down 6% in Q4, despite sort of this new introduction of new products. Any early thoughts into fiscal '24? I know you commented on your -- the margin improvement and the confidence there, but anything on the revenue side that you can help us with would be super helpful. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. I think, first of all, you have seen us be disciplined stewards of the business in good times and bad. You should expect us to continue to maintain operating expenses tightly managed until we see growth. Product margins, as Mike said, should have significant upside as we roll into fiscal year '24 as both mix shifts towards all-flash and component costs in all-flash come down as well as premiums go away. In terms of returning to growth, listen, I think that we will -- we are aligning our resources to be much more focused on our respective businesses. In the flash market, you should expect us to continue to track the progress of our flash market share. I think that, as I said, both enterprise and commercial segments should see growth while the large enterprise takes some more time to come back. And then, I think in terms of cloud, listen, I think consumption will continue to be a headwind for a period of time as our cloud provider partners have also said. That does not mean that we are going to not continue to accelerate new customer acquisition. And a more aligned go-to-market model for flash and for public cloud services, respectively, will help us do that, execute better against each of those opportunities. We'll tell you more when we guide fiscal year '24.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: It seems like April being the fourth quarter fiscal year helps with a little sequential bump in revenue, but should I expect a rather seasonal trend into Q1 fiscal year '24? And I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, at this point, we are being appropriately conservative in our guidance. I think that we see the impact of a tough macro environment on customer spending. And both Mike and I are being appropriately prudent in our Q4 guide. We're not guiding Q1 at this point. We'll guide fiscal year '24 and Q1 when we do that. But at this point, I want to be prudent about what we see in the market.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. And then for Mike, should I assume that the full impact of the headcount reduction is dialed into the April quarter, or would you be able to reduce the OpEx into July quarter?\nMike Berry: Yes. Thanks, Mehdi, for the question. So, we'll get a portion of the restructuring, call it, 70% to 80% because of notifications and other things. So that is baked into our Q4 implied OpEx of about 675, which is down from our previous number of about 715. Most of that is restructuring and some incentive comp. And then, hey, the other thing -- again, we will guide Q1 when we get there. I just want to add two other things to George's great summary going into next year. We talked about product margins. We talked about OpEx. Keep in mind, too, that FX has been a material headwind for us this year, and we expect -- hope that that is at least flat. The other thing is, keep in mind, from a tax rate perspective, we've grown EPS even with a significantly higher tax rate. So, hey, lots of good things going into fiscal '24 that give us confidence in being able to drive the bottom line.\nOperator: The next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Two questions, if I could. First, just curious on the flash C product. Could you talk a little bit about -- it sounds like you're expecting that'll cannibalize or replace some of the disk and hybrid-based systems. Any risk there that there is some impact on the higher performance flash? And what would that mean to margin structure or revenues? And then, I have a follow-up on the cloud after that.\nGeorge Kurian: I think the capacity flash arrays that we recently announced have a workload profile and a performance profile that's distinct from the performance flash array. Performance flash are typically sub-millisecond kind of latency. In capacity flash, it's about 2 to 3 milliseconds. So, they are distinct use cases. Capacity flash will be an upsell on the hybrid flash array and will over time impact the percentage of our business mix that's hybrid flash.\nTim Long: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then on the cloud part and the recovery, two-parter. One, have you noticed any level of engagement? I mean, we've got the pushouts that's going around. But any different level of engagement by the big cloud players? And then, related to that, how have you guys progressed with transitioning ONTAP on-premise customers to also start taking some of your cloud-based services in their hybrid cloud deployments? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We continue to have great engagement with our cloud provider partners. As I mentioned, customer acquisition continues to be a good part of our cloud business. The impact in the quarter is limited because the initial deployments are small. So that's the first. Second, with regard to cross-selling multiple cloud services after the initial use case, we have done well, and I'm pleased with progress. In terms of the customers that we are engaged with on consumption, there is no churn difference, right? So, the pattern is they are reducing the performance level of the storage use case, but they're not churning off our service. So, I feel really good. Actually, I think it's the best part of being a partner is to help your clients use the right combination of services. And then, in terms of penetration of our installed base, while it's early, we continue to see that moving forward steadily. I think the penetration in our NetApp managed enterprise accounts is much higher than in our commercial segment.\nOperator: The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: I guess I had two on the Public Cloud. And if I can just start with just the broader trends that you're seeing in relation to Public Cloud and the pressures around consumption and optimization. It does indicate that not every use case that the enterprises were leveraging were critical in the cloud. I mean how do you think about some of the addressable market that you were defining around the cloud storage and CloudOps? Just in relation to that, I guess, enterprises don't see everything as being critical in the cloud, and there's a lot more room for optimization as is being demonstrated during these budget cuts. And I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: First of all, I think that the long-term trend towards cloud continues to be a strong trend. I think even if you look at the most recent data from analysts as well as from the cloud providers, the public cloud market growth is higher than data center infrastructure growth. So, that's one. I think second is we are learning the behavior patterns of different workload profiles in our customer base. I actually think the fact that customers can spin up and spin down environment is a benefit to the cloud model over the long term because the real cost of operating a cloud environment will then be lower than what you would see on premises. We are, for example, being able to understand -- and as we spread the consumption of our cloud services across a much larger customer base, the impact of any particular customers change in behavior will actually be much less than it is today. So, we remain bullish about the cloud opportunity. We're more sharply focusing our go-to-market resources to go after it and continuing to sharpen the customer success motion to allow our customers to benefit from the use of our technology more completely.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And maybe on the same line, just digging a little bit deeper. Like, what are you seeing in relation to sort of the difference in engagement on Spot versus Cloud Insights? And when you have net revenue retention rates of around 120%, like how does that break down between Spot and the rest of the portfolio maybe seeing a bit more challenges?\nGeorge Kurian: Spot has done well, and Cloud Insights has stabilized and met our internal targets. So, the shortfall was mostly from the cloud storage business. I think that in part, it's the opposite, right? When people are concerned about cost optimization, Spot is a perfect tool for that, and they had a good quarter.\nOperator: The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: The first one is it seems like despite the cloud optimization service being 40% of your portfolio, your cloud portfolio -- the magnitude of decline from Public Cloud service seems to be more than offsetting. Any improvement there? Second is, tell us how was the performance of this? And do you think at some point this year -- calendar year, it could get -- to be more than 50% of your cloud ARR? And then I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: We continue to add new customers to our -- all of our cloud services, CloudOps and cloud storage. The impact of those customers in the first few quarters of they are being acquired is actually small because they typically find small deals, and they are testing out the services or they deploy a development and test environment rather than a production environment. Those customers were actually -- the benefits to our business from those customers was overrun by the reduction from some of the large customers who contracted their spending in the quarter. So, we feel good about new customer additions. Can we do more there? Surely, but I don't think that was a material issue in the quarter.\nMike Berry: And if I could. It's Mike. We talked about, Krish, hey, cloud storage is about 60%. CloudOps is about 40%. We don't see that changing materially. It'll move around a little bit by quarter, but we expect that to remain relatively consistent over the next several quarters.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Got it. Super helpful, George and Mike. And then as a quick follow-up, George, kind of like what is your visibility today? Like, how many months\u2019 visibility do you have? And also to an earlier question, George, you mentioned that when a customer's business gets better, they'll start spending again. I mean, I just wanted to find, is it as simple as that, or do you have to look at other metrics like kind of how you said, deal sizes are smaller, maybe deal size gets larger, you don't need a CFO approval for purchases? Are there any other leading indicators to look into? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We do a whole lot of account level analysis, especially for our larger customers. We look at total wallet. We look at whether we are gaining share or losing share. We look at are we -- do we need to bring new business models to the customer. We have done well with our consumption business. Our Keystone offering, there are many customers that have chosen to use that over the past couple of quarters rather than go the CapEx route. So, we're heavily involved with customers, right? I'll just tell you that it's a daily conversation with customers. I'm just starting to sort of take the broader theme that, in general, what we see with the larger customers is that when their business outlook improves, they generally start to purchase. Some segments that typically go ahead of GDP and economic performance lead the market, and other parts of that large enterprise segment come along when GDP turns around. So look at the business cycle of those customers, that's probably the best leading indicator.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: I had a question on the pricing environment. Are you seeing any incremental pricing pressure from competitors given the slower demand environment? And with the expectation of lower input costs, both on components and NAND give you an opportunity to be more aggressive on pricing, or is that not part of the playbook?\nGeorge Kurian: I think it's always a competitive environment, and it continues to be a competitive environment in a tough demand environment. I don't see any player doing anything kind of out of the ordinary. I think that just like everyone else, we see the opportunity, especially with QLC-based flash arrays, to be competitive in the market.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: You guys have seen a few down cycles in the past 10 years where you saw multiple quarters of overall revenue decline of 10% or more on a year-over-year basis. I think that was in 2016, 2020. Curious how you think this cycle will shake out. Maybe just help us compare and contrast with the previous cycles in terms of the depth and duration of the downturn. Maybe they're completely different. And then I have follow-up question.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think that we've got a different mix of business today than we did in the past. I think there's a growing percentage of our business from more recurring revenue business models like the cloud business. I think we have tried to move more of our resources to parts of the market that are less cyclical and that allow us to acquire new customers to broaden our customer base. I would say we've done a good job, not enough, but we've certainly seen good progress. And we will continue to pivot in that direction. I think the large customer segment behavior pattern is quite similar to what we've seen in the past. I think that 2016 is quite similar to what we see today. The only thing that I would point out is that the -- for many customers, 2020 was a very difficult year. And so, there's -- it hasn't been -- this downturn has not been presaged by many, many years of economic expansion. So, we're hopeful that customers will be back buying in a more predictable pattern than they have in the past.\nSidney Ho: Okay. That's great. Maybe a quick follow-up here. Just on the earlier answer on the operating expenses. You talked about holding OpEx flat until you see growth. But to be clear, are you expecting OpEx to be down in the July quarter from the 675 level in the April quarter, which I know it's seasonally down for OpEx anyway for the July quarter? And you hold expenses at those levels going forward until revenue growth resumes? Is that how we should think about it?\nMike Berry: Yes. Sidney, it's Mike. So, there's a couple of nuances, I'll try to keep this brief, is that in the Q4 number, we do have a portion of the restructuring benefit. We'll get all of that in Q1. The thing that will come back in Q1 is incentive compensation, hopefully will come back. You've seen this, Sidney, in the last -- you talked about some of the downturns. You've seen this coming out of it as well. So, on an absolute dollar perspective, it's probably up slightly Q4 to Q1 just based on that. But everything else from a controllable perspective, we will try to keep that as flat as we can outside of movements in incentive comp.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva: I have different questions, one for George and one for Mike. I'll ask them at the same time, and you all can answer them in any order. But George, in the past several years, you have gained significant market share, very significant. With the slowdown, I'm wondering if you're seeing any share shifts. Are you continuing to gain share, or are you seeing any competitive pricing get even more aggressive? I know it's a competitive market, but your past several years have spoken multiple leagues of share gains. And so, I'm just kind of wondering from that perspective. And then for Mike, can you comment on the FX? Are we looking at kind of maybe two more quarters and then a lapse or 3 or 4 more quarters because the FedEx -- I'm sorry, the FX headwinds are very severe, and you're still keeping your full year guidance, which is remarkable, but the FX, you simply can't, just discredit it because it was so material. So, any looks of when we start to lap that? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think on the share part, our exposure to the large enterprise is bigger than some of our competitors. And so, I think in a down cycle, we will probably concede share given our exposure to those customers. I think the second is now that we have a more kind of full lineup of capacity flash arrays, I feel good that we can compete in all the segments of the flash market, which are key to driving share gains, and keep the hybrid flash segment where we have a strong offering moving forward. And then, I think, as I noted in my comments, we are going to better align our execution in the field so that we can more sharply focus on the storage market and more sharply focus on the cloud market in a more tailored go-to-market model for each.\nMike Berry: And Jim, it's Mike. On your FX question, for a full year now, this is on revenue, we expect it to be about a 350 basis-point headwind for the full year, about 140 basis points in Q4 compared to 340 in Q3. I would expect that it would be almost zero, but slightly a headwind in Q1 and then lap in Q2.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJason Ader: Hey George, are there any headwinds that you guys are seeing on the revenue side from NAND pricing coming down sharply on your AFA business? In other words, just street pricing because we know some of your competitors have kind of a cost-plus -- cost model -- margin model.\nGeorge Kurian: I think that overall customers' budget in dollars, and so we segmented the market and the use cases quite distinctly for performance versus capacity flash. I don't think there's going to be material cannibalization between the two. I think it really comes down to customer budget dollars being available.\nJason Ader: Got you. So is it -- is this different than what we saw back in, like, 2018, 2019 where NAND prices came down really drastically and it affected kind of revenue for the whole industry?\nGeorge Kurian: I think that we've always seen customers buy in dollars, and they budget in dollars. So, I think if you ask me right now, I don't actually see the NAND pricing coming down being the real headwind. I really do think it\u2019s customers' budget and IT spending that's the more material area of focus for us.\nOperator: The next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: On the CloudOps portfolio, you guys have spoken to kind of a more aligned or sharpened go-to-market motion. I just wanted to get a sense of some of the integrations of that product portfolio that was going to happen and just whether that's a part of that kind of refined go-to-market and where we are on that. And then the second kind of piece of that question is just on the cloud storage piece. You guys have had a little bit less of visibility into kind of that customer set, just getting a sense of, are some of these sharpening go-to-market motions kind of overlay sales? Just anything that's happening on the cloud storage to increase visibility there. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. I think first, Meta, on the CloudOps piece, we brought together the sales teams for Instaclustr, CloudCheckr and Spot into one unified CloudOps selling motion. And we've seen good momentum with the integrated team. I think, particularly Spot and Instaclustr, there's good synergy in terms of customer buyer and buying motions that we hope to exploit over the next few quarters. It's too early to call it a success yet. In terms of the product portfolio, we brought some of the functionality of CloudCheckr into Spot already for compliance, and you should see us bringing more of those capabilities into Spot. With regard to cloud storage, listen, I think the most important work that we're doing is to be closely aligned with the hyperscalers, hyperscaler cloud providers and some of the key application motions that are going on, SAP or chip design or VMware. And I think that what we are going to do as we head into FY24 is even more closely align our hyperscaling -- hyperscale sales resources with those buying motions. I think that that will give us a better understanding of customer behavior. We've seen good adoption of our customer success capabilities in our subscription cloud storage business, but we are yet to see the full impact from doing so in the consumption cloud business. And that's work ahead of us.\nOperator: Next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: I'm wondering, how should we think about the impact of your 8% headcount reduction on your top line? I know you mentioned a couple of areas you've invested, but can you provide some more details on where the cuts were made? And how much of it was, I don't know, the proverbial back office versus revenue-focused headcount? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think that those cuts were -- are factored into our guidance for this quarter. And when we guide next year, you should expect us to factor those into the guidance. Broadly speaking, we focused our resources on the biggest market opportunities, and the places that we impacted were less significant contributors to revenue for us. I think in the cloud portfolio as well as in CloudOps, we've made some decisions that will have impact to ARR going forward. But I think that those are in the spirit of let's focus on the best markets and the best opportunities. Our guidance for the quarter envisages those changes. Mike, do you want to add anything?\nMike Berry: No, no. I think that's a great answer. It's all baked in. And we did it across the board. We tried to focus where we didn't have productivity or revenue issues, as George said, a little bit of ARR. Outside of that, we feel good that we focused on the right areas.\nShannon Cross: I guess, were there any cuts in Hybrid Cloud? And then my second question is, what drove the year-over-year increase in stock-based comp given all of the pressures you're seeing? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: In Hybrid Cloud, as I noted in my comments, we impacted Astra Data Store. We are able to solve the Kubernetes use case better through a combination of Astra Control, which we continue to invest in, and ONTAP rather than a completely separate architecture like Astra Data Store. And then, we had a small business in SolidFire that we continue to sustain, but we don't plan to grow going forward.\nMike Berry: Shannon, on your question on stock-based comp, every six months, we have to do a look back on ESPP program. And there was about an $11 million, I'll call it, catch-up entry in the quarter to take into account the lower price of those purchases. And you'll see that typically every six months when we do our ESPP, depending on the price movements of the stock during that period of time.\nShannon Cross: So that catch-up is done now. And assuming your stock stays where it's at, there will be another catch-up? So you'll be at the $50 million or $60 million level going forward? Just to be clear.\nMike Berry: So, it stays in the run rate. It won't drop down. And what happens in six months is dependent on where the stock price is at that purchase date.\nOperator: The next question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Northland. Please go ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: What has been the year-over-year demand trend in the month of February relative to the January quarter? Has it worsened as implied by the guidance even with the C-Series now available?\nGeorge Kurian: We're not going to comment about what's happening this quarter. I think broadly speaking, we're cautious, as you can see in our guidance, about the pattern of IT spending for the year. I think many parts of our business performed well, but the large enterprise, particularly in the Americas, high tech and service provider segments, and certain parts of Europe, particularly UK and Germany, have not performed as well. And we're concerned about how spend -- how robust spending will be there in the short term.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. And what's the postmortem on why you guys were late with the lower capacity product on all-flash arrays?\nGeorge Kurian: We have hybrid flash arrays that serve those use cases. We believe that we could continue to support those use cases with hybrid flash. A few months ago, we -- a few quarters ago, we created a capacity flash product. We started to see strong pickup, but it was at the high end of our lineup, and we realized that we needed to introduce a full lineup. And that has taken us a little bit more time than we expected. So, I feel good about our lineup now. It is the most comprehensive in terms of functionality, use cases, guarantees and price and capacity points in the market.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey George, just sort of circling back to your remarks about concentration with financial services and service provider. Do you feel the company has greater exposure to those end markets than your key competitors? And is there anything that you can do or that you're focused on to try to diversify that exposure? And then, I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I don't want to comment about our competitors. I should let you ask them that question. I think what we have seen is that we are -- have got a large base of high-tech and service provider customers and large enterprise customers. They are demanding customers, and they are forward-leaning. And there's lots of benefits to having those customers. But when they are in a down cycle, it does impact our business. Over the years, we've done a few things to expand our business. I think, one, we continue to invest in the commercial segment. It's too early to call that a broad push, but we've seen good results. We've also brought in the number of enterprise customers. We sign up below the large enterprise. And perhaps most importantly, has been the push to grow our cloud business. Cloud has been the single most strongest vehicle for new customer issues for us, and I'm very pleased with that route-to-market that we've enabled over the past few years.\nAnanda Baruah: That's great context. And the quick follow-up is, both you and Mike, in your prepared remarks -- or Mike, I think, in his prepared remarks and yours in response to a question made reference to mix shift in all-flash in '24 -- sorry, not mix -- industry shift all-flash in '24. So, I was just wondering is that something that you guys see as being distinct from what current trend is. Do you see a break in the trend? And that's it. So, an amplification trend. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think broadly speaking, as we have said in past cycles, when the price of NAND comes down, you see a mix shift towards a flash-based system. Disk-based systems costs have been more steady than sort of up and down like flash. So, that's the broad trend. In our case, we expect that shift to also benefit from the fact that we now have two complete lineups, high-performance flash, which will benefit from NAND and capacity flash, which will also benefit from NAND.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKyle McNealy: Can you talk a little bit about the positive impact you expect to have from AI on the business? What's the positive impact? Where it will come from? Is it a higher mix of high-performance, low-latency all-flash? Is it sheer data growth or both those factors? And do you think we'll have to get past the near-term softer macro environment that you've been talking about through '23 until we see some kind of material new AI workload growth? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: AI workloads continue to grow in parts of the market that are more resilient to commodity cycles. So for example, life sciences, certain elements of financial services, industries that are more countercyclical have done well, and we continue to see that moving forward. AI workloads, especially those that do image and audio analysis, for example, in life sciences, cancer detection or various types of diagnostic cases are perfectly suited to NetApp. I mean, we store a large number of files in a very high-performance system. And so, we are benefiting from those use cases today. And certainly, as the range of AI tool chain continues to grow, we expect that to be a more material contributor to our business going forward.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Kyle. I'm going to pass it back to George for some closing comments.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Our strategy is aligned to the long-term secular growth trends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We address key long-term priorities for our customers with strong positions in each of our key markets and have demonstrated success in controlling the elements within our control. Over the course of our history, we have been through several challenging macroeconomic periods that we have used to sharpen our focus, attack new opportunities and emerge in a better position. We are committed to doing that again. You can expect us to remain prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts across the company in support of our storage business and build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We'll give you updates on our progress in coming quarters. Thank you.\nOperator: This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to reiterate the key themes for today's discussion that George highlighted. Number one, despite the temporary headwinds to revenue, our disciplined operational management yielded op margin and EPS above the high-end of guidance. Number two, the macro backdrop and demand environment continue to be major headwinds. The weakening IT spending environment was most pronounced in our large enterprise and U.S. technology and service provider customers and materially impacted our all-flash revenue in Q3, while significant cloud optimization across all three major hyperscalers continued to weigh heavily on ARR growth. Although the U.S. dollar weakened slightly during Q3, FX continues to be a material headwind to our financial results on a year-over-year basis. Number three, as we navigate through this fluid demand environment, we remain laser focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation. Towards this end, we took swift action in Q3 to control costs through increased program spending scrutiny and a hiring freeze. And at the start of Q4, we implemented a reduction in force of approximately 8%. In addition to adjusting our own cost structure, we also introduced C-Series, a portfolio of QLC capacity-flash arrays to support cost sensitive datacenter customers, and we continued to work with our cloud customers to help optimize their spending. And number four, as a result of our disciplined cost management, we are reiterating our full-year EPS guide of $5.30 to $5.50. We are also confident in our free cash flow target of $1.1 billion, adjusting for the restructuring and one-time cash tax payment in Q4. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of fiscal \u201823 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Now to the details. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Q3 billings were $1.57 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 340 basis-point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been down 7% and 2% year-over-year, respectively. Even with the challenging Q3, our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall revenue growth profile of NetApp. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.38 billion was down 9% year-over-year. Product revenue of $682 million decreased 19% year-over-year, as customers took a decidedly cautious approach to capital spending. Total Q3 recurring support revenue of $616 million increased 5% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q3 at $605 million, up 29% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $150 million, up 36% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. As highlighted by our three major hyperscaler partners, customers continue to optimize their cloud spend as organizations are exercising caution, given the macroeconomic uncertainty. While the timing of the recovery remains unclear, we are confident the secular trends of AI, machine learning, IoT and high-performance computing, along with the migration of enterprise apps like VMware & SAP, will drive long-term growth in cloud storage consumption. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $766 million was up 10% year-over-year, constituting 50% of total revenue. We ended Q3 with $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q3 marks the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 67% in Q3, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 67% in Q3. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 46.5%, including a 2-point year-over-year headwind from FX. As noted, our large enterprise and U.S. tech and service provider customers have continued to reduce CapEx spend as they right-size their spending envelops. These customers are the most forward leaning technology adopters and the biggest consumers of all-flash systems in the economy, and their pause in CapEx spending has had a material impact on our total revenue, all-flash mix and product margins. And while the supply chain component premiums and NAND pricing notably improved in Q3, we had to work through higher-cost inventory during the quarter. We expect the improving supply chain and NAND pricing to be a tailwind to product margin in Q4 and fiscal \u201824. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 69% was accretive to the corporate average for the ninth consecutive quarter. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as the business scales and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. While revenue came in at the low-end of guidance, Q3 highlighted our operational discipline and cost controls, with operating margin of 24%, including 2-points of FX headwinds. EPS of $1.37 came in above the high-end of guidance and included $0.14 of year-over-year FX headwind. Cash flow from operations was $377 million and free cash flow was $319 million. Inventory turns increased to 12 in Q3, up from 9 in Q2, as supply chain challenges eased in the quarter, enabling us to take down inventory by nearly $70 million sequentially. During Q3, we repurchased $200 million in stock and paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $308 million to shareholders, representing 97% of free cash flow. Share count of 219 million was down 4% year-over-year. We closed Q3 with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, up $108 million sequentially. Now to guidance. As George discussed, we have seen continued softening in the macro backdrop, with customers taking a decidedly cautious approach to spending. We now expect fiscal '23 revenue to be roughly flat year-over-year, which includes 3 to 4 percentage points of FX headwind. In fiscal \u201823, we continue to expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and FX headwinds weigh on product margins. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time, particularly when you factor in our new C-Series portfolio, which will largely displace lower margin hybrid spinning disk systems in our product mix. Given our disciplined cost controls, we are raising our fiscal \u201823 operating margin guidance. We now expect op margin to range between 23% and 24%, which includes approximately 2 points of FX headwind. Last quarter, we committed to protecting both, EPS and free cash flow during this uncertain macro environment. Today, we are reiterating our full-year EPS guide of $5.30 to $5.50, which includes $0.54 of currency impacts. We also continue to expect to generate $1.1 billion in free cash flow, excluding one-time items. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of fiscal '23 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Now on to Q4 guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.475 billion and $1.625 billion which, at the midpoint, implies an 8% decrease year-over-year, or a 6% decrease in constant currency. In this macro environment, we expect customers to continue to optimize their cloud spend at our three major hyperscaler partners. As a result, we expect cloud revenue and ARR to be approximately flat sequentially in Q4. Please note, as we head into fiscal \u201824, we plan to anchor our cloud segment guidance on revenue dollars, instead of ARR. To be clear, we will continue to disclose cloud ARR as a key metric as we go through the year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67%. As we head into Q4, we are forecasting a material reduction in component premiums, decreasing NAND costs, and engineering product efficiencies. As such, we are confident that product margins will rise in Q4. These trends also position us nicely heading into fiscal \u201824 to drive leverage through our business model, particularly as customers begin to reengage on all-flash capacity buildouts and customers mix shift away from hybrid spinning disk systems to new QLC all-flash solutions. While the exact timing is unclear, large enterprise and U.S. tech and service provider customers are the largest consumers of data and storage in the global economy and our all-flash ONTAP systems are structurally linked to their data growth cross cycle. In Q4, we expect operating margin to range between 23% and 24%. We anticipate our tax-rate to be approximately 21%. We are forecasting earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.30 and $1.40 per share. Assumed in our Q4 guidance is net interest income of $7.5 million and a share count of approximately 218 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment in such an uncertain economic environment. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Sure. Amit, it's Mike. So, I'll do both, Hybrid Cloud just in a little bit of cloud margins as well. So on Hybrid Cloud, what we really saw was if you go back to the two big drivers that we saw in the business, one is with our lower spending in U.S. strategic large enterprise. They are the largest purveyors of all-flash. So, we saw all-flash dollar and mix come down. In addition, we've talked about seeing lower capacity, i.e., folks buying less terabytes per system. That happened within both, flash and hybrid. So, those two added together brought our margins down in Q3. We didn't really see a benefit on NAND or premiums yet. This is hopefully the last time I'm going to say this on a call because we fully expect in Q4 that to finally start to realize in the P&L, we will see the benefits of a lot lower premiums. And finally, the lower cost NAND as we work through the inventory will roll through the P&L. So, we feel good about the gross margin projection in the April quarter being at least 50%. And then cloud margins, hey, it's really dependent more than anything on scale. We feel good about getting to the mid-70s as we scale that business, but we do need to drive higher revenue. So hopefully, that helps. So this quarter, on the low cost NAND it's not a big number, Steve, in this quarter. We do expect that that will be a significant contributor going into fiscal '24. I would just say, take a step back on the margin side. There are two significant drivers to our optimism as we look at product margins in '24. One is the premiums. We've talked about that. It's about $50 million a quarter. It is a material improvement going into next year. NAND, as we all know, has come down materially every quarter since in the last three quarters. We're finally going to be able to realize in our P&L as we got -- as we move through the high-cost inventory. And then you talked about the mix, that will also benefit product margins going into next year. And then goodness, hopefully, FX also helped. So, I would add all four of those together when you look at product margins in fiscal '24. Yes. Thanks, Mehdi, for the question. So, we'll get a portion of the restructuring, call it, 70% to 80% because of notifications and other things. So that is baked into our Q4 implied OpEx of about 675, which is down from our previous number of about 715. Most of that is restructuring and some incentive comp. And then, hey, the other thing -- again, we will guide Q1 when we get there. I just want to add two other things to George's great summary going into next year. We talked about product margins. We talked about OpEx. Keep in mind, too, that FX has been a material headwind for us this year, and we expect -- hope that that is at least flat. The other thing is, keep in mind, from a tax rate perspective, we've grown EPS even with a significantly higher tax rate. So, hey, lots of good things going into fiscal '24 that give us confidence in being able to drive the bottom line. And if I could. It's Mike. We talked about, Krish, hey, cloud storage is about 60%. CloudOps is about 40%. We don't see that changing materially. It'll move around a little bit by quarter, but we expect that to remain relatively consistent over the next several quarters. Yes. Sidney, it's Mike. So, there's a couple of nuances, I'll try to keep this brief, is that in the Q4 number, we do have a portion of the restructuring benefit. We'll get all of that in Q1. The thing that will come back in Q1 is incentive compensation, hopefully will come back. You've seen this, Sidney, in the last -- you talked about some of the downturns. You've seen this coming out of it as well. So, on an absolute dollar perspective, it's probably up slightly Q4 to Q1 just based on that. But everything else from a controllable perspective, we will try to keep that as flat as we can outside of movements in incentive comp. And Jim, it's Mike. On your FX question, for a full year now, this is on revenue, we expect it to be about a 350 basis-point headwind for the full year, about 140 basis points in Q4 compared to 340 in Q3. I would expect that it would be almost zero, but slightly a headwind in Q1 and then lap in Q2. No, no. I think that's a great answer. It's all baked in. And we did it across the board. We tried to focus where we didn't have productivity or revenue issues, as George said, a little bit of ARR. Outside of that, we feel good that we focused on the right areas. Shannon, on your question on stock-based comp, every six months, we have to do a look back on ESPP program. And there was about an $11 million, I'll call it, catch-up entry in the quarter to take into account the lower price of those purchases. And you'll see that typically every six months when we do our ESPP, depending on the price movements of the stock during that period of time. So, it stays in the run rate. It won't drop down. And what happens in six months is dependent on where the stock price is at that purchase date."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In Q3, we executed well on the elements under our control in the face of a weakening IT spending environment and continued cloud cost optimization. Disciplined operational management yielded operating margin and EPS that exceeded expectations, despite revenue coming in at the low end of our guidance. We are delivering on our commitments and responding to the dynamic environment. We adjusted our cost structure, introduced a portfolio of capacity-flash arrays to support cost sensitive customers, and continue to work with our customers to help them optimize their cloud spending. On today's call, I will discuss our Q3 results in the context of the current environment and our plans to sharpen our execution to accelerate near-term results and enhance our long-term position. We continued to see increased budget scrutiny, requiring higher level approvals, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles, and some deals pushing out. We are feeling this most acutely in large enterprise and the Americas tech and service provider sectors. Customers are looking to stretch their budget dollars, sweating assets, shifting spend to hybrid flash and capacity flash arrays from higher-cost performance flash arrays and, as our cloud partners have described, optimizing cloud spending. We saw signs of a softening environment early in fiscal year \u201823 and took swift action to control costs, with increased scrutiny of program spending, a hiring slowdown in Q2, and a hiring freeze in Q3. At the start of Q4, we implemented a workforce reduction of approximately 8%. Decisions that impact our employees are always difficult. I take great pride in fostering the NetApp culture and am committed to using this difficult action to refocus our team, guided by the values and mission of the Company. Our hybrid flash and QLC-based all-flash arrays continue to perform well, benefiting from customers' price sensitivity in this challenging macro. The shift from high-performance all-flash arrays to lower cost solutions, coupled with the lower spending environment, especially among large enterprise, and U.S. tech and service provider customers who are large consumers of flash, created headwinds to our product and all-flash array revenues. In Q3, our all-flash array business decreased 12% from Q3 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. Public Cloud ARR of $605 million did not meet our expectations, driven by a shortfall in cloud storage as a result of the same factors we experienced last quarter. Spending optimization and the winding down of project-based workloads like chip design, EDA, and HPC were headwinds again in Q3. We have a sizable base of public cloud customers, with a number of large customers who have grown rapidly over the past year and are now optimizing. Their cost optimizations mask the growth of other customers. We continue to add new customers and churn has remained consistently low. Overall, the CloudOps portfolio performed to plan. Cloud Insights has stabilized, and Spot continues to grow nicely, benefiting from the cost optimization trend. Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate decreased to 120% but is still within healthy industry norms. We are confident that we remain well positioned to take advantage of the secular growth trends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We are aligned to customers' top priorities and have demonstrated success in controlling the elements within our control. Building on that solid foundation, we are sharpening our execution to accelerate near-term results while strengthening our position for when the spending environment rebounds. We have three areas of focus: First, we will remain prudent stewards of the business and will continue to tightly manage the elements within our control. Second, we are reinvigorating efforts across the Company in support of our storage business. Third, we are building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. Starting with the first area of focus, remaining prudent stewards of the business and managing the elements within our control. We will maintain our focus on cost controls so that expenses do not grow ahead of revenue. We will achieve this by maintaining our scrutiny on program spending and hiring, as well as focusing our investments on the products that represent the biggest opportunity. We've made difficult decisions to reduce investment in products with smaller revenue potential like Astra Data Store and SolidFire. The results of this focus are visible in our ability to maintain our free cash flow, operating margin, and EPS guidance despite lower revenue. On to the second focus area, reinvigorating our storage business. As we moved rapidly to embrace cloud, we lost some momentum in our Hybrid Cloud business. We are taking decisive action to strengthen our position and performance by better addressing the areas of market growth, delivering more customer value, and realigning our go-to-market activities to better address this opportunity. We were slow to fully embrace the customer desire for lower-cost, capacity-oriented all-flash systems. At the start of Q4, we rectified that situation with the introduction of the AFF C-Series, the most comprehensive, industry-leading portfolio of QLC-based all-flash arrays that addresses a wide range of workloads and price points. These products will help customers manage through a cost sensitive environment while, at the same time, supporting their pursuit of sustainability targets. Initial response has been very positive, and we are already quoting deals for customers. The AFF C-Series will drive AFA revenue and support product gross margin as customers rotate from lower margin hybrid flash to all-flash systems. In addition to expanding our product portfolio, we've introduced a number of innovations to improve the customer experience and bring predictability to their investment process. In Q3, we released BlueXP, a unified control plane that helps decrease resource waste, complexity, and the risk of managing diverse environments. As a part of our sustainability commitment, we're previewing a new dashboard in BlueXP to help customers understand their data center carbon footprint across environments. Early in Q4, we introduced NetApp Advance, a best-in-class portfolio of programs and guarantees, which is already helping us win new customers and drive revenue. We are rebalancing our sales and marketing efforts to better address the significant storage market opportunity, including aligning compensation plans to drive sales of our reinvigorated storage portfolio. We believe that these actions will enable us to drive product revenue growth and regain share in the all-flash array market. Finally, our third area of focus, building a more focused approach to cloud. While we are reinvigorating our storage business, we have no intention of taking our foot off the pedal in Public Cloud. It represents a huge growth opportunity for us with a gross margin profile that is accretive to the business. Additionally, our Public Cloud Services are highly differentiated, with a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors, and create customer preference for NetApp. We have sharpened the focus in our CloudOps portfolio and have taken actions that could have future revenue and ARR implications. We believe that our CloudOps services will continue to deliver stable, steady growth over the long term. Our customer success team has made good progress in driving utilization of our CloudOps services, but we need to do more with our cloud storage and data services. Additionally, we recognize that we have not been using our go-to-market resources to their best effect here. In addition to refocusing our sales team on the reinvigorated storage portfolio, we are identifying ways to most effectively align our sales resources to the buying centers and consumption models for all our solutions. Our cloud storage business is predominately consumption-based and largely driven by our hyperscaler partners. These factors, coupled with the current cloud cost-optimization environment have impacted our ability to forecast ARR. However, as we grow the business, the impact from a subset of customers will be mitigated, smoothing its growth and improving predictability. I want to underscore my confidence in this opportunity. The migration of enterprise applications, like SAP and VMware, to the cloud, as well as cloud-native applications, like artificial intelligence, create a massive market in which we can grow. We believe strongly that Public Cloud services can be a multibillion-dollar ARR business for us. However, achieving that target will take longer than we initially planned due to the industry-wide slowdown in cloud spending and our recent performance. In closing, we have seen tangible success from our efforts to manage the elements within our control in a challenging environment. Despite our lowered revenue outlook, we have preserved free cash flow and EPS expectations. In the first three fiscal quarters of this year, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders and reduced share count by 4%. We are sharpening our execution to accelerate near-term results and enhance our position for the long-term. We are taking these steps now, so that, as we begin FY24, we are in a new, more focused operating model to attack the opportunity ahead, drive growth, and deliver shareholder value. Before turning the call over to Mike, I want to give my thanks to the NetApp team for their operational discipline and rapid response to set us up for better results. I have seen first-hand how hard they are working to navigate the challenging environment and I really appreciate their efforts. I think the broad themes that we saw were shared across all of the hyperscalers and across a broad range of customers. We continue to see good numbers of new customer additions to our cloud storage offerings. Even though the impact in the quarter from there being acquired is lower, we had -- we saw no changes to the churn in our cloud storage business, but we did see optimization, meaning movement of capacity from higher cost, more high-performance levels to lower cost, lower performance levels. And there was no predictable pattern in terms of what types of customers. As we noted last quarter, we also saw some reductions in spending from customers who wrapped up projects with us. So, I will just say this is part of normal cloud behavior and consumption. We feel good about the additions. We feel good about our engagement with customers. And we feel good about the fact that we continue to broaden the number of use cases and customer value propositions we can address that should benefit us moving forward with a more focused route-to-market approach for cloud as well. I think there are three elements of that. I think the first, we have been a little bit later than we would have liked to introduce lower cost more value-oriented capacity flash arrays. We've corrected that. We feel really good about the early interest in our C-Series. The second was that we have moved resources to the more stable, steady growth parts of the market, like the commercial market and lower parts of the enterprise from the cyclical large enterprise segment. We haven't done as much as we need to, and we'll continue to do that heading forward. And the third is that from a compensation and goal alignment perspective, we're going to sharply focus certain parts of our field organization to drive our flash portfolio while aligning other parts of our field organization to focus on the cloud business. I think, first of all, we are excited about the C-Series products. They will be available this quarter. I think the material impact of those product portfolios will be in the first half of next fiscal year. The large enterprise segment will continue to be a place of caution for us. I think that we will need -- we are working with our customers to understand their buying behavior. My sense is that -- and my hope is that they are back buying more aggressively than they have been in the second part of next fiscal year. So, we hope that -- the product portfolio is in the market this quarter. Commercial and lower-end parts of the enterprise should see some benefits from that in the first half of next fiscal year. But the large enterprise segment, we're a bit more cautious about. And your expectation is more accurate around second half of next fiscal year is our hope. We are very closely engaged with these customers. We've known them for decades. I think the fundamental pattern is the improvements in their business prospects. So, as soon as they see that, they start the discussions with us on purchasing. I think that our exposure to the large tech and service provider segments and our large market share in markets like Germany exposed us when those segments and countries slowed down in their purchasing behavior. I think that having a smaller number of QLC products also precluded us from participating in some purchasing activities, some RFPs in the past couple of quarters. And I think we are excited about the return to having the best lineup of flash, both performance and capacity flash. And we've got to see progress in terms of -- continued progress in our enterprise and commercial customers over the next few quarters to wait for the large enterprise purchasing to come back. Yes. I think, first of all, you have seen us be disciplined stewards of the business in good times and bad. You should expect us to continue to maintain operating expenses tightly managed until we see growth. Product margins, as Mike said, should have significant upside as we roll into fiscal year '24 as both mix shifts towards all-flash and component costs in all-flash come down as well as premiums go away. In terms of returning to growth, listen, I think that we will -- we are aligning our resources to be much more focused on our respective businesses. In the flash market, you should expect us to continue to track the progress of our flash market share. I think that, as I said, both enterprise and commercial segments should see growth while the large enterprise takes some more time to come back. And then, I think in terms of cloud, listen, I think consumption will continue to be a headwind for a period of time as our cloud provider partners have also said. That does not mean that we are going to not continue to accelerate new customer acquisition. And a more aligned go-to-market model for flash and for public cloud services, respectively, will help us do that, execute better against each of those opportunities. We'll tell you more when we guide fiscal year '24. Listen, at this point, we are being appropriately conservative in our guidance. I think that we see the impact of a tough macro environment on customer spending. And both Mike and I are being appropriately prudent in our Q4 guide. We're not guiding Q1 at this point. We'll guide fiscal year '24 and Q1 when we do that. But at this point, I want to be prudent about what we see in the market. I think the capacity flash arrays that we recently announced have a workload profile and a performance profile that's distinct from the performance flash array. Performance flash are typically sub-millisecond kind of latency. In capacity flash, it's about 2 to 3 milliseconds. So, they are distinct use cases. Capacity flash will be an upsell on the hybrid flash array and will over time impact the percentage of our business mix that's hybrid flash. We continue to have great engagement with our cloud provider partners. As I mentioned, customer acquisition continues to be a good part of our cloud business. The impact in the quarter is limited because the initial deployments are small. So that's the first. Second, with regard to cross-selling multiple cloud services after the initial use case, we have done well, and I'm pleased with progress. In terms of the customers that we are engaged with on consumption, there is no churn difference, right? So, the pattern is they are reducing the performance level of the storage use case, but they're not churning off our service. So, I feel really good. Actually, I think it's the best part of being a partner is to help your clients use the right combination of services. And then, in terms of penetration of our installed base, while it's early, we continue to see that moving forward steadily. I think the penetration in our NetApp managed enterprise accounts is much higher than in our commercial segment. First of all, I think that the long-term trend towards cloud continues to be a strong trend. I think even if you look at the most recent data from analysts as well as from the cloud providers, the public cloud market growth is higher than data center infrastructure growth. So, that's one. I think second is we are learning the behavior patterns of different workload profiles in our customer base. I actually think the fact that customers can spin up and spin down environment is a benefit to the cloud model over the long term because the real cost of operating a cloud environment will then be lower than what you would see on premises. We are, for example, being able to understand -- and as we spread the consumption of our cloud services across a much larger customer base, the impact of any particular customers change in behavior will actually be much less than it is today. So, we remain bullish about the cloud opportunity. We're more sharply focusing our go-to-market resources to go after it and continuing to sharpen the customer success motion to allow our customers to benefit from the use of our technology more completely. Spot has done well, and Cloud Insights has stabilized and met our internal targets. So, the shortfall was mostly from the cloud storage business. I think that in part, it's the opposite, right? When people are concerned about cost optimization, Spot is a perfect tool for that, and they had a good quarter. We continue to add new customers to our -- all of our cloud services, CloudOps and cloud storage. The impact of those customers in the first few quarters of they are being acquired is actually small because they typically find small deals, and they are testing out the services or they deploy a development and test environment rather than a production environment. Those customers were actually -- the benefits to our business from those customers was overrun by the reduction from some of the large customers who contracted their spending in the quarter. So, we feel good about new customer additions. Can we do more there? Surely, but I don't think that was a material issue in the quarter. We do a whole lot of account level analysis, especially for our larger customers. We look at total wallet. We look at whether we are gaining share or losing share. We look at are we -- do we need to bring new business models to the customer. We have done well with our consumption business. Our Keystone offering, there are many customers that have chosen to use that over the past couple of quarters rather than go the CapEx route. So, we're heavily involved with customers, right? I'll just tell you that it's a daily conversation with customers. I'm just starting to sort of take the broader theme that, in general, what we see with the larger customers is that when their business outlook improves, they generally start to purchase. Some segments that typically go ahead of GDP and economic performance lead the market, and other parts of that large enterprise segment come along when GDP turns around. So look at the business cycle of those customers, that's probably the best leading indicator. I think it's always a competitive environment, and it continues to be a competitive environment in a tough demand environment. I don't see any player doing anything kind of out of the ordinary. I think that just like everyone else, we see the opportunity, especially with QLC-based flash arrays, to be competitive in the market. Listen, I think that we've got a different mix of business today than we did in the past. I think there's a growing percentage of our business from more recurring revenue business models like the cloud business. I think we have tried to move more of our resources to parts of the market that are less cyclical and that allow us to acquire new customers to broaden our customer base. I would say we've done a good job, not enough, but we've certainly seen good progress. And we will continue to pivot in that direction. I think the large customer segment behavior pattern is quite similar to what we've seen in the past. I think that 2016 is quite similar to what we see today. The only thing that I would point out is that the -- for many customers, 2020 was a very difficult year. And so, there's -- it hasn't been -- this downturn has not been presaged by many, many years of economic expansion. So, we're hopeful that customers will be back buying in a more predictable pattern than they have in the past. I think on the share part, our exposure to the large enterprise is bigger than some of our competitors. And so, I think in a down cycle, we will probably concede share given our exposure to those customers. I think the second is now that we have a more kind of full lineup of capacity flash arrays, I feel good that we can compete in all the segments of the flash market, which are key to driving share gains, and keep the hybrid flash segment where we have a strong offering moving forward. And then, I think, as I noted in my comments, we are going to better align our execution in the field so that we can more sharply focus on the storage market and more sharply focus on the cloud market in a more tailored go-to-market model for each. I think that overall customers' budget in dollars, and so we segmented the market and the use cases quite distinctly for performance versus capacity flash. I don't think there's going to be material cannibalization between the two. I think it really comes down to customer budget dollars being available. I think that we've always seen customers buy in dollars, and they budget in dollars. So, I think if you ask me right now, I don't actually see the NAND pricing coming down being the real headwind. I really do think it's customers' budget and IT spending that's the more material area of focus for us. Yes. I think first, Meta, on the CloudOps piece, we brought together the sales teams for Instaclustr, CloudCheckr and Spot into one unified CloudOps selling motion. And we've seen good momentum with the integrated team. I think, particularly Spot and Instaclustr, there's good synergy in terms of customer buyer and buying motions that we hope to exploit over the next few quarters. It's too early to call it a success yet. In terms of the product portfolio, we brought some of the functionality of CloudCheckr into Spot already for compliance, and you should see us bringing more of those capabilities into Spot. With regard to cloud storage, listen, I think the most important work that we're doing is to be closely aligned with the hyperscalers, hyperscaler cloud providers and some of the key application motions that are going on, SAP or chip design or VMware. And I think that what we are going to do as we head into FY24 is even more closely align our hyperscaling -- hyperscale sales resources with those buying motions. I think that that will give us a better understanding of customer behavior. We've seen good adoption of our customer success capabilities in our subscription cloud storage business, but we are yet to see the full impact from doing so in the consumption cloud business. And that's work ahead of us. I think that those cuts were -- are factored into our guidance for this quarter. And when we guide next year, you should expect us to factor those into the guidance. Broadly speaking, we focused our resources on the biggest market opportunities, and the places that we impacted were less significant contributors to revenue for us. I think in the cloud portfolio as well as in CloudOps, we've made some decisions that will have impact to ARR going forward. But I think that those are in the spirit of let's focus on the best markets and the best opportunities. Our guidance for the quarter envisages those changes. Mike, do you want to add anything? In Hybrid Cloud, as I noted in my comments, we impacted Astra Data Store. We are able to solve the Kubernetes use case better through a combination of Astra Control, which we continue to invest in, and ONTAP rather than a completely separate architecture like Astra Data Store. And then, we had a small business in SolidFire that we continue to sustain, but we don't plan to grow going forward. We're not going to comment about what's happening this quarter. I think broadly speaking, we're cautious, as you can see in our guidance, about the pattern of IT spending for the year. I think many parts of our business performed well, but the large enterprise, particularly in the Americas, high tech and service provider segments, and certain parts of Europe, particularly UK and Germany, have not performed as well. And we're concerned about how spend -- how robust spending will be there in the short term. We have hybrid flash arrays that serve those use cases. We believe that we could continue to support those use cases with hybrid flash. A few months ago, we -- a few quarters ago, we created a capacity flash product. We started to see strong pickup, but it was at the high end of our lineup, and we realized that we needed to introduce a full lineup. And that has taken us a little bit more time than we expected. So, I feel good about our lineup now. It is the most comprehensive in terms of functionality, use cases, guarantees and price and capacity points in the market. Listen, I don't want to comment about our competitors. I should let you ask them that question. I think what we have seen is that we are -- have got a large base of high-tech and service provider customers and large enterprise customers. They are demanding customers, and they are forward-leaning. And there's lots of benefits to having those customers. But when they are in a down cycle, it does impact our business. Over the years, we've done a few things to expand our business. I think, one, we continue to invest in the commercial segment. It's too early to call that a broad push, but we've seen good results. We've also brought in the number of enterprise customers. We sign up below the large enterprise. And perhaps most importantly, has been the push to grow our cloud business. Cloud has been the single most strongest vehicle for new customer issues for us, and I'm very pleased with that route-to-market that we've enabled over the past few years. I think broadly speaking, as we have said in past cycles, when the price of NAND comes down, you see a mix shift towards a flash-based system. Disk-based systems costs have been more steady than sort of up and down like flash. So, that's the broad trend. In our case, we expect that shift to also benefit from the fact that we now have two complete lineups, high-performance flash, which will benefit from NAND and capacity flash, which will also benefit from NAND. AI workloads continue to grow in parts of the market that are more resilient to commodity cycles. So for example, life sciences, certain elements of financial services, industries that are more countercyclical have done well, and we continue to see that moving forward. AI workloads, especially those that do image and audio analysis, for example, in life sciences, cancer detection or various types of diagnostic cases are perfectly suited to NetApp. I mean, we store a large number of files in a very high-performance system. And so, we are benefiting from those use cases today. And certainly, as the range of AI tool chain continues to grow, we expect that to be a more material contributor to our business going forward. Thanks, Kris. Our strategy is aligned to the long-term secular growth trends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We address key long-term priorities for our customers with strong positions in each of our key markets and have demonstrated success in controlling the elements within our control. Over the course of our history, we have been through several challenging macroeconomic periods that we have used to sharpen our focus, attack new opportunities and emerge in a better position. We are committed to doing that again. You can expect us to remain prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts across the company in support of our storage business and build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We'll give you updates on our progress in coming quarters. Thank you."

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris and welcome everyone to our Q2 FY 2023 earnings call. Coming off a strong Q1, our team delivered a solid quarter, with all-time highs for Q2 billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income, and EPS. We remain focused on disciplined operational management and the execution of our strategy, which is tightly aligned with customer priorities. On today\u2019s call, I will walk through four topics; one, we delivered a good quarter in a dynamic environment. However, we are disappointed with the deceleration of growth in our cloud services. Our conviction in the cloud opportunity and our ability to execute against it is unwavering. Two, we are aligned with the durable, megatrends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We continue to deliver innovation that furthers our already strong position. Three, we believe strongly in the opportunity ahead, but have slightly tempered our revenue outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, due to near-term macro headwinds. Four, we understand the imperative to deliver shareholder value in a slowing environment and will focus on our strategic growth opportunities, while continually optimizing our operating costs. Let's start with the first point, our performance in the quarter. Q2 public cloud segment revenue increased 63% year-over-year to $142 million and dollar-based net revenue retention rate remained healthy at 140%. However, Public Cloud ARR of $603 million fell short of our expectations. As our cloud partners discussed on their earnings calls, growth has slowed as customers look to optimize cloud spending. This macro-related optimization caused some slowing of growth in our cloud storage services as well. Additionally, we had a few customers with very large project-based workloads like chip design, that came to their natural conclusion, resulting in capacity reductions in those environments. We expect these customers to kick off new projects early next calendar year, as the number of cloud customers and their usage of our cloud services grows, the impact of this type of workload will be smoothed over a much broader customer base. In our cloud operations portfolio, Spot is benefiting from the same desire to optimize cloud spending that was a headwind to our cloud storage services. Spot's value proposition is a strong engine for new logo acquisition and Q2 saw an acceleration of new Spot customer additions from Q1. As we've discussed on past calls, we continue to refine our approach to cloud insights and are seeing early positive signs, with the growth of new Cloud Insights customers in Q2. We continue to see healthy growth of new-to-NetApp customers and of existing NetApp enterprise customers adopting our cloud services and those customers are growing in scale as well. The number of customers with greater than $1 million in ARR has more than doubled from Q1 last year. Our public cloud services are highly differentiated and create customer preference for NetApp. We have a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors in this critical market, positioning us well to deliver sustained growth. Compared to Q2 a year ago, Hybrid Cloud revenue grew 3% and our all-flash array business increased 2% to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.1 billion. Adjusting for the significant FX headwinds, Hybrid Cloud grew 8% and all-flash grew 7% in constant currency. All flash penetration of our installed base grew to 33% of installed systems. Our lower cost, capacity-oriented all-flash arrays and FAS hybrid flash arrays, both performed well. Onto the second point, our alignment to the industry megatrends and our continued innovation. The world is moving faster than ever, raising data-driven digital and cloud transformations to business necessities. NetApp helps meet these objectives with a modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management that we term the evolved cloud. We provide customers the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security, and sustainability, which increases our relevance and value to our customers. We believe strongly in the sizeable, durable, and growing opportunity created by these megatrends. As many of you know, we bring significant value to customers running VMware environments on-premises. With a series of announcements made in conjunction with VMware, we are now able to bring that same value to customers in the cloud. Our native cloud storage service integrated with VMware, helps customers quickly, easily, and cost effectively migrate enterprise workloads to the cloud and accelerate modern application development using Kubernetes. We are the only certified and supported third-party cloud storage solution for VMware Cloud, which creates significant new opportunity for us. As those VMware environments move to the cloud, we can capture the data that resides on competitors\u2019 on-premises systems. At the start of November, we introduced BlueXP, the next big step in fulfilling our vision to give customers the simplicity, security, savings, and sustainability needed for an evolved cloud. It delivers true hybrid, multi-cloud operations by bringing storage and data services together in a single, unified control plane. BlueXP is a highly differentiated solution that enables customers to deploy, discover, manage, and optimize not only infrastructure and data, but supporting business processes across multiple clouds and on-premises environments. In addition to bringing forward technical capabilities, we are helping customers achieve their environmental goals by creating energy efficient products. We have added power and temperature reporting in Cloud Insights to give customers a real-time view into energy expenditure and our carbon footprint reports provide a reasonable estimate for the carbon impact of their NetApp systems. We enhanced our storage efficiency with a 4:1 efficiency guarantee for SAN workloads to help customers minimize their storage footprint and lower energy usage. We not only help customers practice sound environmental stewardship, we practice it ourselves. I am proud to announce that EcoVadis, the leading evidence-based ESG rating agency, awarded NetApp a gold ranking, placing us within the top 7% of evaluated companies. Now the third point, the macro environment and our business outlook. As we moved through the quarter, we saw increased budget scrutiny, requiring higher level approvals, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles, and some deals moving out of the quarter. In Q2, we felt this most acutely in the Americas hi-tech and service provider sectors. We see no change to our underlying opportunity and are confident in our position. However, current economic realities and unprecedented FX headwinds are and will continue to impact IT spending, causing us to temper our revenue expectations for the second half. And finally, point four, driving shareholder value. In response to the slowing top line, we are being agile and taking action to lower operating expenses. Already, we have implemented a broad-based hiring freeze, and are reducing discretionary spending, as well as further optimizing our real estate footprint. We will remain disciplined as we continue to shift resources away from lower yield activities to our biggest opportunities. In closing, we are clearly aligned with our customers' strategic priorities and remain confident in our long-term opportunity, despite the current external headwinds. By focusing on what we can control, we will aggressively seek to maximize the near-term return on our product and services portfolio, while leveraging our leadership position in all-flash, cloud storage, and cloud infrastructure optimization. I would like to thank the entire NetApp team for delivering a strong first half. In a challenging environment, we remain focused on innovation, execution, and operational discipline. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today\u2019s discussion. Number one, as George highlighted, we delivered a strong Q2 in a dynamic environment, with all-time Q2 company highs for billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS. Number two, we have adjusted our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year due to an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment and unprecedented FX headwinds. Number three, as we navigate through the current macro environment, we are laser focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation. As George noted, we have taken actions to reduce our full year expense envelope and will remain fluid in assessing further opportunities to take costs out of the business. Number four, as a result of these cost savings measures, the entirety of the Op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental one to two points from the deepening currency costs we have seen, since our Q1 call; and number five, we continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause Cloud Operations acquisitions for the remainder of fiscal '23. We now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal '23 Free Cash Flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases. Now to the details. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Q2 billings were $1.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.66 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 540 basis point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been up 9% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Even with the challenging Q2, our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3.5 of the six points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.52 billion was up 3% year-over-year. Product revenue of $837 million increased 3% year-over-year. Total Q2 recurring support revenue of $607 million increased 3% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q2 at $603 million, up 55% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $142 million, up 63% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $749 million was up 11% year-over-year, or 16% in constant currency, constituting 45% of total revenue. We ended Q2 with $4.1 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year, or 10% in constant currency. Q2 marks the 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 66.3%, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 66% in Q2, including a two-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 50%, including a three-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 68% was accretive to the corporate average for the eighth consecutive quarter. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as the business scales and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. Q2 highlighted the strong leverage in our business model, with operating margin of 24%, including two-points of FX headwinds. EPS of $1.48 came in nicely ahead of guidance and included a $0.21 year-over-year FX headwind. Cash flow from operations was $214 million and free cash flow was $137 million. Q2 included our annual repatriation tax payment and continued cash outflows for certain inventory and premiums for constrained trailing edge analog parts. Additionally, collections were lower than expected due to a backend loaded quarter for invoicing linearity that you see in the higher accounts receivable balance. Our component purchasing strategy allows us to meet as much customer demand as possible, but remains a clear headwind to cash flow and gross margins. We are seeing signs of relief in supply availability. The timing of a full supply recovery remains uncertain, however, as our inventory levels start to normalize, it will be a tailwind to free cash flow as we go through the second half of fiscal '23. During Q2, we repurchased $150 million in stock and paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $258 million to shareholders, representing 188% of free cash flow. Share count of 220 million was down 4% year-over-year. We closed Q2 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now to guidance. As George discussed, we have seen softening in the macro backdrop, with customers taking a decidedly cautious approach to spending. Additionally, currency headwinds have only continued to increase. We now expect fiscal '23 revenue to grow 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes five points of FX headwind versus the four-point headwind assumed in our prior guidance. We now expect to exit fiscal '23 with Public Cloud ARR of approximately $700 million, which equates to our Public Cloud segment driving three-points of total company revenue growth for the full year. Three drivers are impacting the near-term growth rate of Cloud ARR. Number one, in this macro environment, we project continued optimization of storage services, as we help our customers manage their spending, which benefits Spot, but will offset some incremental near-term storage services ARR. Number two, we expect that project-based workloads will grow in both number and scale, but as they ramp, it will take some time to materialize into sizable ARR; and number three, we continue to tighten up the Cloud Insights sales motion, but we don\u2019t expect this meaningful cross-sell opportunity to materialize until we head into fiscal '24. In fiscal '23, we continue to expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and FX headwinds weigh on product margins. As you know, the vast majority of our bill of materials is procured in US dollars. We are optimistic that supply constraints will ease further in the second half of our fiscal year, reducing our dependence on procuring cost at significant premiums. We should also see a benefit from declining NAND prices in Q4. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time. For the full year, we expect operating margin of approximately 23%, which now includes approximately two points of FX headwind and EPS of $5.30 to $5.50, which now includes more than $0.70 of currency impacts. It\u2019s important to reiterate that we are offsetting the full year revenue adjustment with an extremely disciplined approach to our spending envelope. As a result, the entirety of the Op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental one to two points from the deepening currency costs we have seen since our Q1 call. We continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause cloud operations acquisitions for the remainder of Fiscal 2023, as we sharpen our portfolio focus by refining the Cloud Insight value proposition and sales motion, accelerating the integration of Spot and CloudCheckr into a single FinOps suite, and driving the successful integration of Instaclustr. As I said earlier, we now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal 2023 free cash flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases. Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 1% decrease year-over-year, or 4% growth in constant currency. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to range between 22% and 23%. We anticipate our tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $1.25 and $1.35 per share. Assumed in our Q3 guidance is net interest income of $5 million and a share count of approximately 220 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment in such a dynamic environment. I\u2019ll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks Mike. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Amit Daryani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Pardon, Amit, your line might be muted.\nUnidentified Analyst: Can you hear me?\nKris Newton: Yeah, we can hear now.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. So this is Abdulla [ph] speaking in for Amit. So I think your guys' cloud ARR expectation is coming down by $100 million versus prior expectations. And I just wanted to ask whether you guys could perhaps touch on the softness there? Is this more on compute, storage or analytics? And maybe if there's one cloud provider where the ramps are more challenged versus not? I would appreciate any details here. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think we expect to see the continuation of some of the trends that we saw in Q2, which is the consumption oriented cloud offerings in our portfolio, which are cloud storage services were most impacted by customers wanting to reduce their spending. It could involve either them reducing the amount of capacity they use on our offerings or us proactively helping them migrate some of their workloads from a high-performance tier to a more cost-effective tier, so that they will continue to see value and benefit with us. That's one. Second, we saw in Q2 some project-based workloads, for example, large-scale semiconductor design that came to its natural conclusion. We anticipate some of those workloads coming back in the early part of next calendar year, but we are being cautious about that. And then finally, with our Cloud Insights product, we have continued to work to sharpen the focus on the use case of the products. We saw some early success in terms of new customer wins -- new to Cloud Insights customer wins. But we're being cautious about the future growth rate of that product until we see further evidence of success. So I think those were the three. I did not see anything materially different between the different cloud providers. Clearly, our relationship with Microsoft is the largest of the three, given that we've worked with them for the longest, and so they saw the biggest impact this quarter.\nA \u2013 Kris Newton: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two follow-ups. George, if I just take your guidance commentary, you suggest that all-flash array revenues should show Q-over-Q and year-over-year decline in January quarter?\nA \u2013 George Kurian: We don't -- we didn't guide anything specific in terms of all-flash array revenue. We have guided at the total company level. We're being cautious about our outlook given what we saw in the quarter and the continued macroeconomic environment. We are not guiding any specific product category maybe.\nQ \u2013 Mehdi Hosseini: Just that's what I walked away with. Is that a realistic assumption for all-flash array revenues were to decline?\nA \u2013 Kris Newton: We're not guiding down to the product line, Mehdi. Sorry, that we can't help you with that.\nQ \u2013 Mehdi Hosseini: Yeah. That's fine. At least I tried. Just -- and then a follow-up to your comment about the chip design. There's obviously product migration. They are expected to introduce new products for AI application. You also suggested that, that should help you with a rebound in the cloud data services. And I want to better understand whether your underlying assumption, do you think that product transition is going to ramp in early calendar year. Is it -- is your guide on cloud data services completely derisked given this transition. Sometimes these transitions take longer. And I'm just wondering what are the key assumptions there?\nA \u2013 George Kurian: I think with our cloud outlook, we've been cautious to address three topics, right? One is consumption services on the cloud are being impacted by customers reducing spend either by optimizing the performance level that they use or the total capacity they use in our cloud storage services. That will happen for a period of time and then we will see build back. We don't see that yet in the outlook. I think with regard to project-based workloads, listen, there are lots of different customers with different projects. I think in this case; we saw a few large projects come off our environment. And we've been cautious about how many of those come back in terms of our outlook. It will take time for them to come back as new projects and new chip designs. We are the only option in the public cloud for semiconductor chip design technologies to be verified as a cloud service. So, we expect, over time, more and more customers will use our cloud services but that will take time. And then I think in our CloudOps portfolio, as I said, we are pleased with the work that we've done so far. There's still more work to be done. And so we're being appropriately cautious about how fast that product portfolio, especially Cloud Insights grows in the second half of this year.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. Hi George, hi Mike. Maybe just a big picture question on macro and linearity and how you thought about the quarter as it progressed because obviously, you did a good job of cutting costs, managing the business to the economic backdrop. But all-flash arrays were relatively weaker in the quarter, suggesting that obviously, you probably knew early in the quarter that customers were looking for more maybe cost conscious or cost-effective solutions. And you mentioned a lot of decisions were picked up to the CTO level or the CFO level. So, can you, kind of, discuss what you saw as the quarter progressed from a demand perspective? Was there a pivot point or was it just sort of a gradual bleed as we walk through each of the months? And how did it relate to, let's say, 90 days ago when we had this conversation? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think it got progressively worse through the quarter. I think you see us being appropriately cautious in our guide as a result as well. I think that the rate increases getting compounded at a very fast clip certainly impacted customers' business confidence, and that got the range of customers that were affected with their business confidence grew through the quarter and the depth of the impact on spending grew. I don't think we saw any particularly meaningful shifts between product mix in the quarter. Hybrid flash has performed well for a few quarters now and all-flash has been -- as a percentage of our total mix has been more steady than as a growing percentage of our mix. So, I think -- I don't think that our view of the product portfolio affected as much as the view of the total business opportunity available in customers. I'll let Mike add any color.\nMike Berry: Yes. Thanks, George. So David. Per George's comments, when we saw linearity in the quarter, month one was relatively consistent with what we've seen in, I'll call it, non-Q4 quarters. What we really saw was month two push into month three. And typically, we will see, call it, mid 40% of transactions and invoices in month three. That pushed to almost 60% this quarter. So, what you saw was in the second month of the quarter really started to push into the third month. And that's what we saw that really back-end linearity that I spoke about in my prepared remarks.\nDavid Vogt: Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up for you, Mike. Just maybe on the currency headwinds, that incremental point or two. I know your business is primarily denominated in dollars. But can you kind of help us understand that transition from negative three to negative four to negative five, the US dollar has weakened a bit as of late. Just kind of want to get a better understanding kind of what's under the surface there and what's kind of driving that incremental headwind from an FX perspective? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Yes. Sure, David, happy to. So, the significant foreign currencies we have like most international companies, it's euro, GBP, yen and Aussie dollar. And what we saw, again, across most of those is August and September was when the dollar was the strongest. So, that's when the most significant impact hit. That stayed largely through October. Now, what we saw after our quarter ended, is, hey, it got a little bit better in November, the dollar weakened a little bit. Yes, we'll see if that holds. Everything we've put in front of you, we have used FX rates as of the end of October. So, it says a little bit better, that will be good. But making our living betting on FX rates, we're not going to try that. So we use October rates for the rest of the year.\nDavid Vogt: Yes, that's helpful. End of the mouth is great. Perfect. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, George.\nMike Berry: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAngela Jin: Hi. This is Angela Jin on for Samik Chatterjee. And my first question. So, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that, customer weakness was concentrated in Americas hi-tech and service provider sectors. Can we just dive more into the dynamics of each of your customer vertical/segments. Were there certain ones that held up better, enterprise versus SMB, for example? And what types of specific behaviors or patterns that you see in each vertical?\nGeorge Kurian: We don't have any specific vertical that is a material contribution to our revenue. Let me start there. I think the -- what we saw through the quarter was, public sector did well, both in the Americas and internationally. I thought that our European team performed exceptionally well to deliver a strong result in the face of increasing headwinds. And in our outlook for the international markets, we are appropriately cautious about Germany, where our team did phenomenally well in Q2, but there's just growing pressure economically. I think with regard to the North American market, the midsized enterprise segment team did a good job. We saw good results there. We're cautious about the potential in that segment, given their historic vulnerability to recession and macro exposure, but our team did well in Q2. I think the larger enterprise in those specific verticals were the ones where we saw the most substantive change in spending, and we expect them to be cautious go forward. Last year, from a year-on-year compare, last year public -- the high tech and service provider and the large enterprise segment did well for us. So this is a year-on-year compare, as well that we are working through.\nAngela Jin: Got it. And then for my follow-up, with the cloud ARR target lowered to $700 million, looking ahead to the out year, I'm not asking for you to predict how deep or long a potential downturn could be. But how are you thinking about risk to that $2 billion cloud ARR target by fiscal year '26. And what gives you confidence that you can accelerate ARR in those out years?\nMike Berry: Hey Angela, it's Mike. So, as we both talked about, look, we still feel really good about the cloud business, both Cloud Storage and CloudOps. We have some things to work through this year. So even though Q2 was not where we would like, we still feel really good about the future. We will update our views of fiscal 2024 and the $2 billion when we give you guidance for next year. So we'll ask you to wait until we update our fiscal 2024 numbers in a couple of quarters.\nGeorge Kurian: I think where we are focused on at the moment with our cloud business is to make sure that we are a good partner to our customers so that we can optimize their spend where they need help doing that. We are going to be continuing to accelerate our focus on selling more of our cloud products to our installed base where today it's about 15% of our Hybrid Cloud customers have our cloud products. And we have grown the number of cloud customers and the number of them that are buying more than one cloud service. So there's lots of opportunity ahead. We're focused on blocking and tackling and executing on the opportunities in front of us.\nAngela Jin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. I'll ask both of them upfront to either George or Mike. Thanks for the color on the cloud customer scenario. I'm kind of curious like one of your competitors just two weeks ago mentioned the storage demand is still pretty strong from cloud customers. I'm kind of curious, is the weakness you're seeing NetApp customer specific, or is there any share loss due to competitive threats? That's the first question. And then the follow-up is on the cloud ARR from $800 million to $700 million, yet we spoke about a high retention rate. So is the challenge now signing new customers with ANF? This is the ramp of AWS FSx? Any color there would be helpful on the ARR cut? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think with regard to what we saw in the quarter was really we have unique cloud services, which are native, first party cloud services. Those are consumption offerings that we give customers. They were the ones most impacted. None of our competitors have native first-party consumption cloud services. They offer it through the marketplace. The marketplace business for us stayed relatively consistent. And so that is what you would expect. The subscription business is less susceptible to near-term changes in usage than the consumption business. And so the benefits of consumption being you can turn it on and off also shows up when customers want to optimize spend. We want to be a good partner to the customers that want to do that. And so we are working with our hyperscaler partners to give them access to more options to be more cost effective with their spend. Spot, which is the compute optimization platform actually did well in the quarter. So while the storage consumption was impacted by spend, as I noted in my remarks, Spot was a -- which is a vehicle to optimize computing spend did very well in the quarter. And so we continue to help our customers through that journey. With regard to growth opportunities, listen, as I said, we felt very good about the number of customer adds. We felt very good about the amount of cross-selling we are starting to see dollar-based net retention rate has been strong, and so several good things in our cloud business.\nKrish Sankar: And on the ARR side?\nMike Berry: So on the ARR point, so there's been a couple of questions about the $800 million down to the $700 million. So when we looked at that, originally, when we had given the $800 million, we expect it to be, call it, somewhere around $650 million as of the end of Q2. Taking a look at the second half now, we expect to grow about $100 million. That's all organic because we don't have any acquisitions baked in. And we expect that to continue to grow across cloud storage, specifically ANF, FSx and GCP, we all expect to see some good growth. We have tried to be conservative or cautious, I will say, around the consumption business because we do expect that to come back in the second half. We're just not really sure if it's going to be Q3 or Q4. So we feel really good about the $700 million, still a significant growth in that business. But stepping it down a little bit based on the Q2 results and also take a step back a little bit on Cloud Insights. So that's the -- I'll call it, Krish, the product view of the rest of the year.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks a lot George. Thanks a lot Mike.\nA \u2013 George Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Sidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a couple more on the public cloud side. So on the reported quarter, your public cloud revenue on an annualized basis was lower than your ARR exiting last quarter. Is it fair to say that there were some cancellations and maybe some restructuring of some of the deals based on the three dynamics that you guys talked about earlier. And if so, how do you feel comfortable about the future ARR would not be reduced from the churn level? And maybe I'll just throw in the next question here. If you look at your revised ARR for the $700 million, if I exclude the inorganic growth and then make some certain assumptions about dollar-based net retention, you still need quite a bit of ARR coming from new customers. So in terms of new customers, which offerings are you seeing the most traction at this point? Thank you.\nA \u2013 Mike Berry: Hey, Sidney, it's Mike. So let me do the first one. So great question. So we finished Q1 at $584 million in ARR. If you simply take -- divide that by four, you get about $146 million that you'd expect to recognize in revenue. The revenue recognized in the quarter was $142 million. And the nuance here is that typically, you can make -- you can do that calculation, it's going to flow very nicely because of the things that we talked about in terms of some of the consumption being reduced during the quarter, some of the project-based initiatives, especially the larger chip design wins. Those happened during the quarter. Thus, we did lose some revenue that was in the ARR as of the beginning of the quarter. So that's the nuance. We don't expect to see that happen in the future. It's a great question, but it was largely due to that. The third part is the back-ended linearity on some of the subscription business that follows the NetApp, I'll call it, core business as well. So it's really those three things attributed to that revenue coming in lower than simply taking the ARR divided by four.\nQ \u2013 Sidney Ho: Great. And in terms of the new customers -- ARR from new customers?\nA \u2013 George Kurian: Listen, we had a good quarter in terms of new customer additions. We have two major vehicles for new customer additions. The first being the native cloud services that we help our cloud provider partners, Amazon, Microsoft and Google sell for us. Those continue to be good vehicles for new customer additions. And then Spark has continued to be a strong vehicle for new customer additions. So I feel good about the pace of net new customers.\nQ \u2013 Sidney Ho: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Victor Chiu: This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. You noted several customers that concluded several large projects and then drove capacity reductions. Can you help clarify what changed versus your expectations exactly because the way that you kind of described at the conclusions were kind of natural and then so we assumed it would have been somewhat expected. So, either did they conclude earlier? I think you mentioned there was some chip design kind of timing-related issues. Can you just help us clarify why this dynamic was not expected?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think we have seen in the past projects get concluded in a quarter and other projects get started up within the same quarter or by other customers within the quarter. This time, we saw some particularly large projects that concluded in the quarter where the start of the next project is beyond the finish of the quarter and further out than we would like. So, I think that was the nature of what happened in the quarter. I think the -- would honestly want to get better visibility. We are working on that. I think this is when we have another partner selling the service to the end customer. Our sales teams are working to get better visibility into the end customers kind of priorities and spending time lines. So that's on us. We can do better on that, and I promise that.\nVictor Chiu: Okay. And then just quickly, regarding your commentary on macro headwinds, are you observing explicit behavioral trends or having explicit discussions with customers that makes you confident that the slowing is specific to the macro environment versus a more secular shift like accelerating workload migrations to the public cloud?\nGeorge Kurian: I think we are closely engaged with a large number of the enterprise customers through our direct sales force in the midsized enterprise market, as you know, we go to market with the channel providers. In terms of the customer behavior we saw in the quarter, it is very reflective of a typical macro cycle, more approvals for deals, smaller deal sizes, projects being broken up into phases rather than one large purchase and some deals moving out of the quarter. That did not mean that other customers did not start projects with us and move them forward. We know that those projects are -- that we did not lose share to somebody else because we are in ongoing dialogue around the other phases of the projects that are yet to come online.\nVictor Chiu: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to get a sense of whether we could get what the size of Hi-tech and service provider is as a percentage of the cloud revenue or just kind of any vertical concentration that we should be mindful of? And then maybe last quarter, you had given kind of the storage services as a percentage of cloud ARR. If we could just have an update there, that would be helpful as well. Thanks,\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. Listen, Meta, we're not going to break out specific verticals. I would just say that we saw a broad-based -- hi-tech is quite a broad segment, and we saw a fairly conservative posture across that segment. Service provider could -- is also broadly defined. It could be telco. It could be hosting provider. It could be some form of cloud providers. So, these are broader categories than a very specific definition. And we saw a fairly conservative postures across most of those customers.\nMike Berry: Amy [ph], it's Mike. On your second question, so two data points for you. Cloud storage continues to be almost exactly 60% of the total and that includes, as of the end of Q2, Instaclustr and CloudCheckr which are in CloudOps. So there you see the great growth we've seen in cloud storage because overall, as a total number has stayed right around 60%. The other important number is we've talked about consumption versus subscription. As of the end of Q2, it's pretty close to 50-50, a little bit a couple of percentage points higher for consumption. We do expect by the end of the year with that $700 million for that to get much closer to 60%, because that's where we expect the growth across ANF, GCP and FSx, those products as well. So those are the two data points we gave you that break down that cloud ARR number.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks, so much.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Hi, thanks guys for taking the question. Actually two clarifications, if I could. Mike, just the remarks you made a couple of times in the prepared comments about and this is really the clarification. FX driving sort of some portion of the guide down or whatever that context was. Could you clarify that that? And then I have a quick follow-up clarification as well.\nMike Berry: Sure, Ananda. Happy to. So that was in reference to on the Q1 call, we had given -- this is directly related to EPS. We've given $5.50 as the midpoint. Since that time, because of the continued strengthening of the dollar and the weakening of the FX situation, the $5.40 is actually above what that number would have been on an FX-adjusted basis, that's about $5.37. The point there being, hey, we're seeing even in the second half with the lower outlook around revenue, we're doing all we can around costs and other efficiencies to ensure that we continue to still drive that EPS number consistent with the number we gave you last time on the call.\nAnanda Baruah: I got it. That's super helpful. And then, the second clarification is, to one of the questions, you mentioned, you gave some context around timing of pickup and something along -- well, it was sort of -- that was sort of the gist of it. But I think, Mike, the comments you made, where you expect demand to come back in the second half, though you weren't sure it was Q3 or Q4. Could you clarify that? And is it -- is it fiscal Q3, Q4, or is it calendar '23 Q3, Q4 in addition to the clarification. Thanks.\nMike Berry: Sure. So I've been trained and I only talk about fiscal year, calendar years. So this was second half fiscal, and that was directly related to the cloud ARR growth. So we finished at $603 million. We've guided end of year to $700 million. We are not going to guide Q3. We feel good about the second half because again, these are some of those -- these large project-based as well as consumption. When does that flow in? Is it in our fiscal Q3 or Q4? We feel confident about the second half. There's a little bit of nuance around whether it's three or four, hence, we're only doing the end of the year.\nAnanda Baruah: That's super helpful. And so, was that the same, like, that anecdotally, you guys are experiencing, and George, feel free to jump in on this too, anecdotally, you guys are -- you're experiencing a little bit of a sideways here, call it, a pause. You anticipate that it's going to last, I guess, like in period of max six months, eight months, let's say starts slowing mid-quarter, could last an additional six months But you do expect then pickup in some context after that. Anecdotally, is that the gist of what you guys are communicating?\nMike Berry: Well, keep in mind, Ananda, all this is related to the cloud ARR. This is not the Hybrid Cloud. And this is more of just us talking about when we expect it to come back in the second half. And again, because of the large project base, that's really the nuance on this more than anything versus us calling, hey, we expect to see things pick up after April.\nAnanda Baruah: Got it, got it, got it. Okay, cool. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Good afternoon. George, on your outlook and Mike, on your outlook, you mentioned about slowing economic comments, which is understood. Any thoughts around inventory digestion, is there a sense that there's inventory digestion out there. And if so, how long or any double ordering, or is it just purely economic pausing and elongation of cycles?\nGeorge Kurian: We did not see any order cancellations or any of those things. As we have mentioned repeatedly, we have good line of sight into our customer\u2019s spending priorities and behaviors and are directly engaged with the largest of them. I think as we saw in this quarter, and we continue to be cautious about looking at the second half of the year. These are clearly related to IT budget revisions, right, where they are reducing deal sizes or scrutinizing projects and things, we'll defer a portion of that project to a subsequent quarter or a subsequent part of the calendar year. So we have good visibility into the activities in our customers, and we did not see cancellations of orders because of prior orders or double ordering.\nJim Suva: Great. Thanks. But on the inventory digestion, any thoughts of -- were there any inventory that's still being digested that may allow corporate or service providers to prolong these revisions, or is any concern about inventory out there?\nGeorge Kurian: Typically, during macro situations like these, we have seen customers sweat their assets. And so what we mean by that is they will drive a system to a higher level of utilization and so that they can defer either capacity augmentation or system upgrades for a period of time. Now that's not forever, right? Storage is consumed because data keeps growing. And so there's always that trade-off. We certainly see some of that behavior going on. Jim, I think, certainly in our service provider segment, we see that. And in some of the hi-tech verticals, we saw that as well.\nJim Suva: Great. Thank you so much for the details and clarifications.\nGeorge Kurian: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Wang: It's actually George Wang on for Tim Long. I have two questions. Firstly, George, maybe you can elaborate on the current state of deal integration in terms of Spot, Instaclustr. And any thought process behind the following deal until FY 2024?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, we have a good portfolio of technologies already. And what we are really focused on is sharpening the use cases that are best suited to the current macro environment and making those use cases easy for the customers to adopt, expand and renew, right? And that operational focus is our highest priority. There are some -- there's work to be done to integrate the CloudCheckr capabilities into the Spot suite so that it becomes one broader offering rather than two parallel offerings. We have made good progress along the way, but there's more work to be done. In Instaclustr, there are two unique value adds that we bring. One is the integration of our cloud storage services and Spot services into Instaclustr. And the second is the fact that it is a truly open-source data services platform. We have the first of those two being worked. And so we feel like there's a lot of value we already have in our portfolio. There's work to be completed, and we want to keep our teams focused on that work on the technology side. On the go-to-market side, we also have more broad enablement and training for our sales teams to be able to position Spot and Instaclustr and CloudCheckr into the account. So we feel good about the work we're doing. We got to finish it before we look at other things.\nQ \u2013 George Wang: Okay. Cool. Yeah, a quick follow-up is on the cost cuts. Maybe you can elaborate on the kind of disaggregate just components for the cost cuts, whether that's sales and marketing, the SG&A or kind of some of the R&D? Any color would be appreciated.\nA \u2013 Mike Berry: Hey, George, it's Mike. And just I want to make sure your question was the -- what are we looking at for cost reductions in the second half? Was that the question?\nQ \u2013 George Wang: Yes.\nA \u2013 Mike Berry: Perfect. Thank you. So there's several that I think you're going to see flow through the P&L. I'm going to start all the way at the top, which is we do expect to finally see some relief from our significant expenditures related to premiums. The supply chain is getting a little bit better. It gets better every day. So that's going to help the second half. In addition, NAND pricing will help us as well. Now we do have a little bit of inventory to work through. And you'll see that still in Q3, but we expect by Q4, you'll see that as well. On the OpEx side, we're -- George talked about and we've already done a headcount freeze. We're taking a look at all discretionary spending, including travel, programs, outside services, just like everybody else who has embraced the hybrid work environment. We'll take a hard look at our facilities costs as well. So we've already started down the path on several of those as I talked about, hey, we'll continue to look at those as we go into the second half. So there's numerous areas for us to focus on. In addition, keep in mind, too, that in OpEx, there's a good bit of that cost structure related to incentive comp and commissions. And certainly, those will come down in the second half as well.\nQ \u2013 George Wang: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Nehal Chokshi: Yeah. Thanks. So -- the total revenue guidance is lowered by 400 basis points that characterizes 100 basis points due to incremental FX, another 100 basis points due to lower PCS ARR target. And then the remaining 200 basis points either due to weaker billings results on a constant currency basis during the quarter, or is it a weaker billings result that has started to transpire during the third quarter, again, on a constant currency basis?\nA \u2013 Mike Berry: So for the second half, Nehal, that is mostly related to product revenue, which would be largely booked and recognized in the quarter. So it's -- there's -- backlog is largely at the normal rates, the seasonal normal rates that we would expect. So that is going to be systems in the second half, I think, is the third part of your question.\nNehal Chokshi: Excellent. Okay. And then dollar-based net revenue retention rate declined quite significantly, 192 to 140. Is this largely because of the project-related stuff?\nGeorge Kurian: Dollar-based net revenue retention was 150 last quarter, and it's now 140. So, step down as the base of customers expand, and we did see some churn in our consumption business, as we noted on our call, so we don't see that as materially different than what we would expect.\nMike Berry: And to George's point, Nehal, we've been calling that for several quarters, which is add that ARR number gets bigger, that dollar-based net retention percentage will come down. We like to call it the 120, 130, where we think it will land, but we have been calling that percentage to continue to decline as that number increases.\nNehal Chokshi: That you have. Okay. And then just finally, Mike, the PCS GM did come down both Q-on-Q and year-over-year. Why is that?\nGeorge Kurian: The PCS gross margin came down because of the revenue scale relative to the infrastructure that we have deployed. Note that the consumption business, some elements of those are based on our deployed systems, right, in the cloud provider environments. And when they have less scale, you see less utilization, you see less gross margin.\nMike Berry: It came down from 69.7% to 68.3%, so down slightly. And to George's point, that's largely due to scale. We continue to feel good, as I mentioned in my notes about the 75% to 80% as we drive that scale.\nNehal Chokshi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. I appreciate the fiscal year guide. But George, you were talking earlier about IT budgets and some caution around that. I was wondering if you could share some color on what you're hearing from customers more around calendar 2023 IT budgets? And what's your view on how you expect the storage market to grow in 2023 and your growth relative to that? And I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: I think with regard to 2023, we're being cautious we aren\u2019t guiding next fiscal year, but we are being cautious about the start to calendar year 2023. We have seen typically in these macro situations that new budget outlays to start a calendar year probably take longer than typical. So, we've been cautious about the start of the new calendar year. With regard to the storage market overall, I think it's going to be paced by new workload deployments. I think there will be customers that will be forced to upgrade systems because their existing systems are coming to either end of useful life or end of they're just out of capacity or performance. But I think the majority will prioritize new workload deployments and/or system consolidation for cost and energy benefit use cases. We continue to see -- while the cloud migrations are slowing down a bit, we continue to see that as a long-term trend that customers are going to take on for a whole bunch of reasons. And so I think cloud will outpace on-prem in the broader market. And in the on-prem world, we see NAND helping flash be a bigger part of the mix going forward. Our capacity flash products had a good quarter, our hybrid flash products had a good quarter, they are typical about where customers are cost conscious.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. That's helpful, George. And just a follow-up on your last comment about the NAND market. Every few years, you see the significant dislocation in pricing and this one is quite severe. You guys noted the benefit that you will recognize in gross margin terms. But can you just remind us on how you're thinking about the impact to revenues based on the NAND price decline? Are you expecting a deceleration in AFA revenues, or are you expecting elasticity of demand to offset that? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Customers' budget in dollars, the current macro environment has been spending less dollars, but they'll probably shift the mix to AFAs, if there's more value in the offering, right? So we see them budget in dollars, Wamsi.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. But in aggregate terms, would you say that the customer budgets would be up or down like in full in aggregate, whether it's cloud on-prem, all put together?\nGeorge Kurian: I think overall, year-on-year, I think '23, we expect to be moderated and down relative to '22, certainly at the start of the year. '22 had a good start to the year. And so our start of the new calendar year, which is baked into our outlook for the second half of fiscal year, we think people are going to be more cautious overall, Wamsi.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you so much, George.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. I was just wondering what you're hearing from customers on your Keystone offering. I think, as a service offerings, they are becoming a bit more attractive in an economic downturn. So I'm wondering what kind of traction you're seeing there?\nGeorge Kurian: It's early, but good traction. We are focused with a few channel partners who are enabled on selling Keystone. We've had good customer wins, good momentum in terms of our offerings. We brought new innovation to market in the last quarter, both a unified control plane so that you can use either a Keystone-based consumption offering in your environment or our public cloud offerings, and you can move workloads and licenses across those. So a good amount of innovation. And you're correct, we'll continue to see opportunities to help customers around whatever their kind of buying model is in this environment.\nShannon Cross: Great and thanks. And I look forward to seeing you on Thursday at our conference.\nMike Berry: I as well look forward to seeing on Thursday.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKyle McNealy: Hey good afternoon. Thanks very much for the question. You touched on this a bit earlier, but not directly. But does the budget scrutiny that you're seeing right now from some subset of customers' impact their decisions for provisioning the mix that they're provisioning of all-flash versus hybrid arrays at least for new projects. And I know you mentioned that our all-flash portfolio has leading cost efficiency, but do you expect the mindset to change on how much customers are willing to embrace more all-flash? Will the pockets of slowdown that you're seeing potentially pull everything back and the mix stays relatively on the same trajectory? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I think -- thank you for the question. We didn't see customer\u2019s sort of reevaluating technical decisions about what type of infrastructure to buy. I think that allowed the technical team to choose what was the most value, and they make decisions based on the relative cost effectiveness of disk versus flash. I think what we saw was an approval level going up for the same deal what would have been approved by a director, now got taken up to VP what was approved by VP, probably goes up to a CTO. That is what elongated deal cycles in the quarter and/or people shrinking how much they wanted to buy at one time and phasing projects into multiple phases.\nKyle McNealy: Okay. Thanks very much. That\u2019s helpful.\nKris Newton: All right. Thank you, Kyle. I'm going to give it back to George for a couple of closing thoughts.\nGeorge Kurian: While there are near-term economic challenges for every company, we know that our opportunity ahead is substantial, durable and growing. The fundamentals of our business are strong and the value we bring customers is undeniable. Our strategic growth opportunities all-flash arrays, cloud storage and cloud infrastructure optimization are tightly aligned to customers' top priority and represent the potential for long-term sustained and profitable growth. We will continue to be disciplined stewards of the business, focusing on our strategic growth opportunities while continually optimizing our operating costs to drive shareholder value. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion. Number one, as George highlighted, we delivered a strong Q2 in a dynamic environment, with all-time Q2 company highs for billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS. Number two, we have adjusted our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year due to an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment and unprecedented FX headwinds. Number three, as we navigate through the current macro environment, we are laser focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation. As George noted, we have taken actions to reduce our full year expense envelope and will remain fluid in assessing further opportunities to take costs out of the business. Number four, as a result of these cost savings measures, the entirety of the Op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental one to two points from the deepening currency costs we have seen, since our Q1 call; and number five, we continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause Cloud Operations acquisitions for the remainder of fiscal '23. We now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal '23 Free Cash Flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases. Now to the details. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Q2 billings were $1.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.66 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 540 basis point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been up 9% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Even with the challenging Q2, our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3.5 of the six points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.52 billion was up 3% year-over-year. Product revenue of $837 million increased 3% year-over-year. Total Q2 recurring support revenue of $607 million increased 3% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q2 at $603 million, up 55% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $142 million, up 63% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $749 million was up 11% year-over-year, or 16% in constant currency, constituting 45% of total revenue. We ended Q2 with $4.1 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year, or 10% in constant currency. Q2 marks the 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 66.3%, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 66% in Q2, including a two-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 50%, including a three-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 68% was accretive to the corporate average for the eighth consecutive quarter. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as the business scales and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. Q2 highlighted the strong leverage in our business model, with operating margin of 24%, including two-points of FX headwinds. EPS of $1.48 came in nicely ahead of guidance and included a $0.21 year-over-year FX headwind. Cash flow from operations was $214 million and free cash flow was $137 million. Q2 included our annual repatriation tax payment and continued cash outflows for certain inventory and premiums for constrained trailing edge analog parts. Additionally, collections were lower than expected due to a backend loaded quarter for invoicing linearity that you see in the higher accounts receivable balance. Our component purchasing strategy allows us to meet as much customer demand as possible, but remains a clear headwind to cash flow and gross margins. We are seeing signs of relief in supply availability. The timing of a full supply recovery remains uncertain, however, as our inventory levels start to normalize, it will be a tailwind to free cash flow as we go through the second half of fiscal '23. During Q2, we repurchased $150 million in stock and paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $258 million to shareholders, representing 188% of free cash flow. Share count of 220 million was down 4% year-over-year. We closed Q2 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now to guidance. As George discussed, we have seen softening in the macro backdrop, with customers taking a decidedly cautious approach to spending. Additionally, currency headwinds have only continued to increase. We now expect fiscal '23 revenue to grow 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes five points of FX headwind versus the four-point headwind assumed in our prior guidance. We now expect to exit fiscal '23 with Public Cloud ARR of approximately $700 million, which equates to our Public Cloud segment driving three-points of total company revenue growth for the full year. Three drivers are impacting the near-term growth rate of Cloud ARR. Number one, in this macro environment, we project continued optimization of storage services, as we help our customers manage their spending, which benefits Spot, but will offset some incremental near-term storage services ARR. Number two, we expect that project-based workloads will grow in both number and scale, but as they ramp, it will take some time to materialize into sizable ARR; and number three, we continue to tighten up the Cloud Insights sales motion, but we don't expect this meaningful cross-sell opportunity to materialize until we head into fiscal '24. In fiscal '23, we continue to expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and FX headwinds weigh on product margins. As you know, the vast majority of our bill of materials is procured in US dollars. We are optimistic that supply constraints will ease further in the second half of our fiscal year, reducing our dependence on procuring cost at significant premiums. We should also see a benefit from declining NAND prices in Q4. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time. For the full year, we expect operating margin of approximately 23%, which now includes approximately two points of FX headwind and EPS of $5.30 to $5.50, which now includes more than $0.70 of currency impacts. It's important to reiterate that we are offsetting the full year revenue adjustment with an extremely disciplined approach to our spending envelope. As a result, the entirety of the Op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental one to two points from the deepening currency costs we have seen since our Q1 call. We continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause cloud operations acquisitions for the remainder of Fiscal 2023, as we sharpen our portfolio focus by refining the Cloud Insight value proposition and sales motion, accelerating the integration of Spot and CloudCheckr into a single FinOps suite, and driving the successful integration of Instaclustr. As I said earlier, we now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal 2023 free cash flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases. Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 1% decrease year-over-year, or 4% growth in constant currency. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to range between 22% and 23%. We anticipate our tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $1.25 and $1.35 per share. Assumed in our Q3 guidance is net interest income of $5 million and a share count of approximately 220 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment in such a dynamic environment. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Yes. Thanks, George. So David. Per George's comments, when we saw linearity in the quarter, month one was relatively consistent with what we've seen in, I'll call it, non-Q4 quarters. What we really saw was month two push into month three. And typically, we will see, call it, mid 40% of transactions and invoices in month three. That pushed to almost 60% this quarter. So, what you saw was in the second month of the quarter really started to push into the third month. And that's what we saw that really back-end linearity that I spoke about in my prepared remarks. Yes. Sure, David, happy to. So, the significant foreign currencies we have like most international companies, it's euro, GBP, yen and Aussie dollar. And what we saw, again, across most of those is August and September was when the dollar was the strongest. So, that's when the most significant impact hit. That stayed largely through October. Now, what we saw after our quarter ended, is, hey, it got a little bit better in November, the dollar weakened a little bit. Yes, we'll see if that holds. Everything we've put in front of you, we have used FX rates as of the end of October. So, it says a little bit better, that will be good. But making our living betting on FX rates, we're not going to try that. So we use October rates for the rest of the year. Thank you, David. Hey Angela, it's Mike. So, as we both talked about, look, we still feel really good about the cloud business, both Cloud Storage and CloudOps. We have some things to work through this year. So even though Q2 was not where we would like, we still feel really good about the future. We will update our views of fiscal 2024 and the $2 billion when we give you guidance for next year. So we'll ask you to wait until we update our fiscal 2024 numbers in a couple of quarters. So on the ARR point, so there's been a couple of questions about the $800 million down to the $700 million. So when we looked at that, originally, when we had given the $800 million, we expect it to be, call it, somewhere around $650 million as of the end of Q2. Taking a look at the second half now, we expect to grow about $100 million. That's all organic because we don't have any acquisitions baked in. And we expect that to continue to grow across cloud storage, specifically ANF, FSx and GCP, we all expect to see some good growth. We have tried to be conservative or cautious, I will say, around the consumption business because we do expect that to come back in the second half. We're just not really sure if it's going to be Q3 or Q4. So we feel really good about the $700 million, still a significant growth in that business. But stepping it down a little bit based on the Q2 results and also take a step back a little bit on Cloud Insights. So that's the -- I'll call it, Krish, the product view of the rest of the year. Amy [ph], it's Mike. On your second question, so two data points for you. Cloud storage continues to be almost exactly 60% of the total and that includes, as of the end of Q2, Instaclustr and CloudCheckr which are in CloudOps. So there you see the great growth we've seen in cloud storage because overall, as a total number has stayed right around 60%. The other important number is we've talked about consumption versus subscription. As of the end of Q2, it's pretty close to 50-50, a little bit a couple of percentage points higher for consumption. We do expect by the end of the year with that $700 million for that to get much closer to 60%, because that's where we expect the growth across ANF, GCP and FSx, those products as well. So those are the two data points we gave you that break down that cloud ARR number. Thank you. Sure, Ananda. Happy to. So that was in reference to on the Q1 call, we had given -- this is directly related to EPS. We've given $5.50 as the midpoint. Since that time, because of the continued strengthening of the dollar and the weakening of the FX situation, the $5.40 is actually above what that number would have been on an FX-adjusted basis, that's about $5.37. The point there being, hey, we're seeing even in the second half with the lower outlook around revenue, we're doing all we can around costs and other efficiencies to ensure that we continue to still drive that EPS number consistent with the number we gave you last time on the call. Sure. So I've been trained and I only talk about fiscal year, calendar years. So this was second half fiscal, and that was directly related to the cloud ARR growth. So we finished at $603 million. We've guided end of year to $700 million. We are not going to guide Q3. We feel good about the second half because again, these are some of those -- these large project-based as well as consumption. When does that flow in? Is it in our fiscal Q3 or Q4? We feel confident about the second half. There's a little bit of nuance around whether it's three or four, hence, we're only doing the end of the year. Well, keep in mind, Ananda, all this is related to the cloud ARR. This is not the Hybrid Cloud. And this is more of just us talking about when we expect it to come back in the second half. And again, because of the large project base, that's really the nuance on this more than anything versus us calling, hey, we expect to see things pick up after April. Thank you. And to George's point, Nehal, we've been calling that for several quarters, which is add that ARR number gets bigger, that dollar-based net retention percentage will come down. We like to call it the 120, 130, where we think it will land, but we have been calling that percentage to continue to decline as that number increases. It came down from 69.7% to 68.3%, so down slightly. And to George's point, that's largely due to scale. We continue to feel good, as I mentioned in my notes about the 75% to 80% as we drive that scale. I as well look forward to seeing on Thursday."

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks, Kris and welcome everyone to our Q2 FY 2023 earnings call. Coming off a strong Q1, our team delivered a solid quarter, with all-time highs for Q2 billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income, and EPS. We remain focused on disciplined operational management and the execution of our strategy, which is tightly aligned with customer priorities. On today's call, I will walk through four topics; one, we delivered a good quarter in a dynamic environment. However, we are disappointed with the deceleration of growth in our cloud services. Our conviction in the cloud opportunity and our ability to execute against it is unwavering. Two, we are aligned with the durable, megatrends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We continue to deliver innovation that furthers our already strong position. Three, we believe strongly in the opportunity ahead, but have slightly tempered our revenue outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, due to near-term macro headwinds. Four, we understand the imperative to deliver shareholder value in a slowing environment and will focus on our strategic growth opportunities, while continually optimizing our operating costs. Let's start with the first point, our performance in the quarter. Q2 public cloud segment revenue increased 63% year-over-year to $142 million and dollar-based net revenue retention rate remained healthy at 140%. However, Public Cloud ARR of $603 million fell short of our expectations. As our cloud partners discussed on their earnings calls, growth has slowed as customers look to optimize cloud spending. This macro-related optimization caused some slowing of growth in our cloud storage services as well. Additionally, we had a few customers with very large project-based workloads like chip design, that came to their natural conclusion, resulting in capacity reductions in those environments. We expect these customers to kick off new projects early next calendar year, as the number of cloud customers and their usage of our cloud services grows, the impact of this type of workload will be smoothed over a much broader customer base. In our cloud operations portfolio, Spot is benefiting from the same desire to optimize cloud spending that was a headwind to our cloud storage services. Spot's value proposition is a strong engine for new logo acquisition and Q2 saw an acceleration of new Spot customer additions from Q1. As we've discussed on past calls, we continue to refine our approach to cloud insights and are seeing early positive signs, with the growth of new Cloud Insights customers in Q2. We continue to see healthy growth of new-to-NetApp customers and of existing NetApp enterprise customers adopting our cloud services and those customers are growing in scale as well. The number of customers with greater than $1 million in ARR has more than doubled from Q1 last year. Our public cloud services are highly differentiated and create customer preference for NetApp. We have a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors in this critical market, positioning us well to deliver sustained growth. Compared to Q2 a year ago, Hybrid Cloud revenue grew 3% and our all-flash array business increased 2% to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.1 billion. Adjusting for the significant FX headwinds, Hybrid Cloud grew 8% and all-flash grew 7% in constant currency. All flash penetration of our installed base grew to 33% of installed systems. Our lower cost, capacity-oriented all-flash arrays and FAS hybrid flash arrays, both performed well. Onto the second point, our alignment to the industry megatrends and our continued innovation. The world is moving faster than ever, raising data-driven digital and cloud transformations to business necessities. NetApp helps meet these objectives with a modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management that we term the evolved cloud. We provide customers the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security, and sustainability, which increases our relevance and value to our customers. We believe strongly in the sizeable, durable, and growing opportunity created by these megatrends. As many of you know, we bring significant value to customers running VMware environments on-premises. With a series of announcements made in conjunction with VMware, we are now able to bring that same value to customers in the cloud. Our native cloud storage service integrated with VMware, helps customers quickly, easily, and cost effectively migrate enterprise workloads to the cloud and accelerate modern application development using Kubernetes. We are the only certified and supported third-party cloud storage solution for VMware Cloud, which creates significant new opportunity for us. As those VMware environments move to the cloud, we can capture the data that resides on competitors' on-premises systems. At the start of November, we introduced BlueXP, the next big step in fulfilling our vision to give customers the simplicity, security, savings, and sustainability needed for an evolved cloud. It delivers true hybrid, multi-cloud operations by bringing storage and data services together in a single, unified control plane. BlueXP is a highly differentiated solution that enables customers to deploy, discover, manage, and optimize not only infrastructure and data, but supporting business processes across multiple clouds and on-premises environments. In addition to bringing forward technical capabilities, we are helping customers achieve their environmental goals by creating energy efficient products. We have added power and temperature reporting in Cloud Insights to give customers a real-time view into energy expenditure and our carbon footprint reports provide a reasonable estimate for the carbon impact of their NetApp systems. We enhanced our storage efficiency with a 4:1 efficiency guarantee for SAN workloads to help customers minimize their storage footprint and lower energy usage. We not only help customers practice sound environmental stewardship, we practice it ourselves. I am proud to announce that EcoVadis, the leading evidence-based ESG rating agency, awarded NetApp a gold ranking, placing us within the top 7% of evaluated companies. Now the third point, the macro environment and our business outlook. As we moved through the quarter, we saw increased budget scrutiny, requiring higher level approvals, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles, and some deals moving out of the quarter. In Q2, we felt this most acutely in the Americas hi-tech and service provider sectors. We see no change to our underlying opportunity and are confident in our position. However, current economic realities and unprecedented FX headwinds are and will continue to impact IT spending, causing us to temper our revenue expectations for the second half. And finally, point four, driving shareholder value. In response to the slowing top line, we are being agile and taking action to lower operating expenses. Already, we have implemented a broad-based hiring freeze, and are reducing discretionary spending, as well as further optimizing our real estate footprint. We will remain disciplined as we continue to shift resources away from lower yield activities to our biggest opportunities. In closing, we are clearly aligned with our customers' strategic priorities and remain confident in our long-term opportunity, despite the current external headwinds. By focusing on what we can control, we will aggressively seek to maximize the near-term return on our product and services portfolio, while leveraging our leadership position in all-flash, cloud storage, and cloud infrastructure optimization. I would like to thank the entire NetApp team for delivering a strong first half. In a challenging environment, we remain focused on innovation, execution, and operational discipline. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. I think we expect to see the continuation of some of the trends that we saw in Q2, which is the consumption oriented cloud offerings in our portfolio, which are cloud storage services were most impacted by customers wanting to reduce their spending. It could involve either them reducing the amount of capacity they use on our offerings or us proactively helping them migrate some of their workloads from a high-performance tier to a more cost-effective tier, so that they will continue to see value and benefit with us. That's one. Second, we saw in Q2 some project-based workloads, for example, large-scale semiconductor design that came to its natural conclusion. We anticipate some of those workloads coming back in the early part of next calendar year, but we are being cautious about that. And then finally, with our Cloud Insights product, we have continued to work to sharpen the focus on the use case of the products. We saw some early success in terms of new customer wins -- new to Cloud Insights customer wins. But we're being cautious about the future growth rate of that product until we see further evidence of success. So I think those were the three. I did not see anything materially different between the different cloud providers. Clearly, our relationship with Microsoft is the largest of the three, given that we've worked with them for the longest, and so they saw the biggest impact this quarter.\nA \u2013 Kris Newton: Thank you. Next question please. I think it got progressively worse through the quarter. I think you see us being appropriately cautious in our guide as a result as well. I think that the rate increases getting compounded at a very fast clip certainly impacted customers' business confidence, and that got the range of customers that were affected with their business confidence grew through the quarter and the depth of the impact on spending grew. I don't think we saw any particularly meaningful shifts between product mix in the quarter. Hybrid flash has performed well for a few quarters now and all-flash has been -- as a percentage of our total mix has been more steady than as a growing percentage of our mix. So, I think -- I don't think that our view of the product portfolio affected as much as the view of the total business opportunity available in customers. I'll let Mike add any color. We don't have any specific vertical that is a material contribution to our revenue. Let me start there. I think the -- what we saw through the quarter was, public sector did well, both in the Americas and internationally. I thought that our European team performed exceptionally well to deliver a strong result in the face of increasing headwinds. And in our outlook for the international markets, we are appropriately cautious about Germany, where our team did phenomenally well in Q2, but there's just growing pressure economically. I think with regard to the North American market, the midsized enterprise segment team did a good job. We saw good results there. We're cautious about the potential in that segment, given their historic vulnerability to recession and macro exposure, but our team did well in Q2. I think the larger enterprise in those specific verticals were the ones where we saw the most substantive change in spending, and we expect them to be cautious go forward. Last year, from a year-on-year compare, last year public -- the high tech and service provider and the large enterprise segment did well for us. So this is a year-on-year compare, as well that we are working through. I think where we are focused on at the moment with our cloud business is to make sure that we are a good partner to our customers so that we can optimize their spend where they need help doing that. We are going to be continuing to accelerate our focus on selling more of our cloud products to our installed base where today it's about 15% of our Hybrid Cloud customers have our cloud products. And we have grown the number of cloud customers and the number of them that are buying more than one cloud service. So there's lots of opportunity ahead. We're focused on blocking and tackling and executing on the opportunities in front of us. I think with regard to what we saw in the quarter was really we have unique cloud services, which are native, first party cloud services. Those are consumption offerings that we give customers. They were the ones most impacted. None of our competitors have native first-party consumption cloud services. They offer it through the marketplace. The marketplace business for us stayed relatively consistent. And so that is what you would expect. The subscription business is less susceptible to near-term changes in usage than the consumption business. And so the benefits of consumption being you can turn it on and off also shows up when customers want to optimize spend. We want to be a good partner to the customers that want to do that. And so we are working with our hyperscaler partners to give them access to more options to be more cost effective with their spend. Spot, which is the compute optimization platform actually did well in the quarter. So while the storage consumption was impacted by spend, as I noted in my remarks, Spot was a -- which is a vehicle to optimize computing spend did very well in the quarter. And so we continue to help our customers through that journey. With regard to growth opportunities, listen, as I said, we felt very good about the number of customer adds. We felt very good about the amount of cross-selling we are starting to see dollar-based net retention rate has been strong, and so several good things in our cloud business. Listen, I think we have seen in the past projects get concluded in a quarter and other projects get started up within the same quarter or by other customers within the quarter. This time, we saw some particularly large projects that concluded in the quarter where the start of the next project is beyond the finish of the quarter and further out than we would like. So, I think that was the nature of what happened in the quarter. I think the -- would honestly want to get better visibility. We are working on that. I think this is when we have another partner selling the service to the end customer. Our sales teams are working to get better visibility into the end customers kind of priorities and spending time lines. So that's on us. We can do better on that, and I promise that. I think we are closely engaged with a large number of the enterprise customers through our direct sales force in the midsized enterprise market, as you know, we go to market with the channel providers. In terms of the customer behavior we saw in the quarter, it is very reflective of a typical macro cycle, more approvals for deals, smaller deal sizes, projects being broken up into phases rather than one large purchase and some deals moving out of the quarter. That did not mean that other customers did not start projects with us and move them forward. We know that those projects are -- that we did not lose share to somebody else because we are in ongoing dialogue around the other phases of the projects that are yet to come online. Yes. Listen, Meta, we're not going to break out specific verticals. I would just say that we saw a broad-based -- hi-tech is quite a broad segment, and we saw a fairly conservative posture across that segment. Service provider could -- is also broadly defined. It could be telco. It could be hosting provider. It could be some form of cloud providers. So, these are broader categories than a very specific definition. And we saw a fairly conservative postures across most of those customers. We did not see any order cancellations or any of those things. As we have mentioned repeatedly, we have good line of sight into our customer's spending priorities and behaviors and are directly engaged with the largest of them. I think as we saw in this quarter, and we continue to be cautious about looking at the second half of the year. These are clearly related to IT budget revisions, right, where they are reducing deal sizes or scrutinizing projects and things, we'll defer a portion of that project to a subsequent quarter or a subsequent part of the calendar year. So we have good visibility into the activities in our customers, and we did not see cancellations of orders because of prior orders or double ordering. Typically, during macro situations like these, we have seen customers sweat their assets. And so what we mean by that is they will drive a system to a higher level of utilization and so that they can defer either capacity augmentation or system upgrades for a period of time. Now that's not forever, right? Storage is consumed because data keeps growing. And so there's always that trade-off. We certainly see some of that behavior going on. Jim, I think, certainly in our service provider segment, we see that. And in some of the hi-tech verticals, we saw that as well. Yeah. Thank you. Listen, we have a good portfolio of technologies already. And what we are really focused on is sharpening the use cases that are best suited to the current macro environment and making those use cases easy for the customers to adopt, expand and renew, right? And that operational focus is our highest priority. There are some -- there's work to be done to integrate the CloudCheckr capabilities into the Spot suite so that it becomes one broader offering rather than two parallel offerings. We have made good progress along the way, but there's more work to be done. In Instaclustr, there are two unique value adds that we bring. One is the integration of our cloud storage services and Spot services into Instaclustr. And the second is the fact that it is a truly open-source data services platform. We have the first of those two being worked. And so we feel like there's a lot of value we already have in our portfolio. There's work to be completed, and we want to keep our teams focused on that work on the technology side. On the go-to-market side, we also have more broad enablement and training for our sales teams to be able to position Spot and Instaclustr and CloudCheckr into the account. So we feel good about the work we're doing. We got to finish it before we look at other things.\nQ \u2013 George Wang: Okay. Cool. Yeah, a quick follow-up is on the cost cuts. Maybe you can elaborate on the kind of disaggregate just components for the cost cuts, whether that's sales and marketing, the SG&A or kind of some of the R&D? Any color would be appreciated.\nA \u2013 Mike Berry: Hey, George, it's Mike. And just I want to make sure your question was the -- what are we looking at for cost reductions in the second half? Was that the question?\nQ \u2013 George Wang: Yes.\nA \u2013 Mike Berry: Perfect. Thank you. So there's several that I think you're going to see flow through the P&L. I'm going to start all the way at the top, which is we do expect to finally see some relief from our significant expenditures related to premiums. The supply chain is getting a little bit better. It gets better every day. So that's going to help the second half. In addition, NAND pricing will help us as well. Now we do have a little bit of inventory to work through. And you'll see that still in Q3, but we expect by Q4, you'll see that as well. On the OpEx side, we're -- George talked about and we've already done a headcount freeze. We're taking a look at all discretionary spending, including travel, programs, outside services, just like everybody else who has embraced the hybrid work environment. We'll take a hard look at our facilities costs as well. So we've already started down the path on several of those as I talked about, hey, we'll continue to look at those as we go into the second half. So there's numerous areas for us to focus on. In addition, keep in mind, too, that in OpEx, there's a good bit of that cost structure related to incentive comp and commissions. And certainly, those will come down in the second half as well.\nQ \u2013 George Wang: Okay. Great. Thank you. Dollar-based net revenue retention was 150 last quarter, and it's now 140. So, step down as the base of customers expand, and we did see some churn in our consumption business, as we noted on our call, so we don't see that as materially different than what we would expect. The PCS gross margin came down because of the revenue scale relative to the infrastructure that we have deployed. Note that the consumption business, some elements of those are based on our deployed systems, right, in the cloud provider environments. And when they have less scale, you see less utilization, you see less gross margin. I think with regard to 2023, we're being cautious we aren't guiding next fiscal year, but we are being cautious about the start to calendar year 2023. We have seen typically in these macro situations that new budget outlays to start a calendar year probably take longer than typical. So, we've been cautious about the start of the new calendar year. With regard to the storage market overall, I think it's going to be paced by new workload deployments. I think there will be customers that will be forced to upgrade systems because their existing systems are coming to either end of useful life or end of they're just out of capacity or performance. But I think the majority will prioritize new workload deployments and/or system consolidation for cost and energy benefit use cases. We continue to see -- while the cloud migrations are slowing down a bit, we continue to see that as a long-term trend that customers are going to take on for a whole bunch of reasons. And so I think cloud will outpace on-prem in the broader market. And in the on-prem world, we see NAND helping flash be a bigger part of the mix going forward. Our capacity flash products had a good quarter, our hybrid flash products had a good quarter, they are typical about where customers are cost conscious. Customers' budget in dollars, the current macro environment has been spending less dollars, but they'll probably shift the mix to AFAs, if there's more value in the offering, right? So we see them budget in dollars, Wamsi. I think overall, year-on-year, I think '23, we expect to be moderated and down relative to '22, certainly at the start of the year. '22 had a good start to the year. And so our start of the new calendar year, which is baked into our outlook for the second half of fiscal year, we think people are going to be more cautious overall, Wamsi. Yes, thank you. It's early, but good traction. We are focused with a few channel partners who are enabled on selling Keystone. We've had good customer wins, good momentum in terms of our offerings. We brought new innovation to market in the last quarter, both a unified control plane so that you can use either a Keystone-based consumption offering in your environment or our public cloud offerings, and you can move workloads and licenses across those. So a good amount of innovation. And you're correct, we'll continue to see opportunities to help customers around whatever their kind of buying model is in this environment. I think -- thank you for the question. We didn't see customer's sort of reevaluating technical decisions about what type of infrastructure to buy. I think that allowed the technical team to choose what was the most value, and they make decisions based on the relative cost effectiveness of disk versus flash. I think what we saw was an approval level going up for the same deal what would have been approved by a director, now got taken up to VP what was approved by VP, probably goes up to a CTO. That is what elongated deal cycles in the quarter and/or people shrinking how much they wanted to buy at one time and phasing projects into multiple phases. While there are near-term economic challenges for every company, we know that our opportunity ahead is substantial, durable and growing. The fundamentals of our business are strong and the value we bring customers is undeniable. Our strategic growth opportunities all-flash arrays, cloud storage and cloud infrastructure optimization are tightly aligned to customers' top priority and represent the potential for long-term sustained and profitable growth. We will continue to be disciplined stewards of the business, focusing on our strategic growth opportunities while continually optimizing our operating costs to drive shareholder value. Thank you."

At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.\nKris Newton: Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for second quarter and fiscal year 2023, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns, our resilience and opportunity for future growth in the turbulent macroeconomic environment, our ability to drive continued growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments, our ability to invest in areas of high return while managing supply chain constraints and maintaining disciplined operational management, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.

I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. We delivered a great start to the year, with company all-time Q1 highs for billings, revenue, gross margin dollars, operating income and EPS, fueled by broad-based demand across our portfolio and geographies. Achieving record results in the face of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, decades-high inflation and supply constraints underscores our disciplined operational management. As organizations accelerate their data-driven digital and cloud transformations, our relevance grows. We are helping customers navigate disruption with a modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management. Our opportunity is defined by the complexities created by rapid data and cloud growth, multi-cloud management and the adoption of next-generation technologies such as AI, Kubernetes and modern databases. The urgency to address these priorities increased with the COVID pandemic, and is further driven by the turbulent macro economy. Customers are searching for ways to reduce costs, improve flexibility, increase automation and accelerate application delivery in the public cloud, in their own data centers and in hybrid cloud environments. Our role in helping organizations achieve these transformation goals underpins our strategy and confidence in future growth. Let me share with you a couple of examples how data intensive applications like AI drive demand for both our Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud solutions. A global e-commerce company chose ONTAP AI for several AI workloads, including natural language processing, recommendation engines, and deep learning. Our ultra-high-performance storage, close partnership with NVIDIA and tight application integration were key to the win and the customer has realized better performance and reliability while reducing its operating costs and data center footprint. A Fortune 500 hyperscaler is adopting a hybrid cloud strategy to augment existing on-premises AI/ML workloads. It chose Azure NetApp Files to accelerate AI research and development on cutting-edge machine learning, training workloads for its AI business unit. The initial footprint consists of nearly one petabyte of Azure NetApp Files storage with plenty of opportunity for continued growth. Our AI solutions remove data processing bottlenecks at the edge, core, and cloud to enable more efficient data collection, accelerated AI workloads, faster time to insight, and smoother cloud integration. Now, let\u2019s turn to our Public Cloud segment performance for the quarter. In Q1, we continued to see strong demand for our Public Cloud services. Public Cloud ARR grew 73% year-over-year, exiting Q1 at $584 million. Public Cloud segment revenue grew 67% from Q1 a year ago to $132 million and dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 151% remains healthy. We continue to expand our Public Cloud customer base, the penetration into our Hybrid Cloud installed base, and the percentage of customers using multiple of our public cloud services. Storage services constitute approximately 60% of our Public Cloud ARR. We see significant opportunity for continued growth in this part of our business as we help customers migrate or deploy data-intensive, demanding storage workloads to the cloud. Early in Q1, AWS announced that FSx for NetApp ONTAP is SAP-certified. SAP certification for Azure NetApp Files has helped drive large, business-critical deployments on that service and we are excited about the potential to see similar workloads deployed on FSx for ONTAP. We recently announced that NetApp is the only cloud storage service provider certified and supported for use as an external data store for VMware Cloud environments, further expanding the opportunity for our public cloud storage services. We\u2019ve long been known for the high levels of enterprise-grade data services, we bring to on-premises VMware environments and now, we can bring those same benefits to VMware workloads running in the major public clouds. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we made organizational changes to increase focus on renewal and expansion motions and refined our go-to-market execution to better address the cloud operations opportunity. These actions are starting to deliver results. In Q1, Spot bounced back, returning to its prior growth trajectory. Cloud Insights stabilized but remains a work in progress as we continue to optimize our sales and customer success motions. We delivered a substantial amount of innovation in our cloud operations portfolio with announcements of general availability of Spot Security, Spot PC, and Ocean for Apache Spark, providing fully managed serverless infrastructure for Apache Spark, on Google Cloud. We also completed the acquisition of Instaclustr, a leading provider of fully managed open-source database, pipeline, and workflow applications. We can now combine the Spot capabilities of continuous infrastructure optimization, automation, monitoring, and security with expertise in deploying and operating fully managed open-source applications to help our customers focus on their business goals, building and releasing leading-edge applications at speed. Onto our Hybrid Cloud segment. In Q1, Hybrid Cloud revenue grew 6% year-over-year, driven by solid product revenue growth of 8%. All-flash array annualized revenue run rate grew 7% year-over-year to $3 billion. All-flash penetration of our installed base grew to 32% of installed systems. FAS hybrid arrays again posted strong unit growth. The breadth of our storage systems portfolio enables us to address a broad range of customer business, technical and economic requirements. Under a single, unified management environment, we offer high-performance all-flash arrays for mission-critical, performance-sensitive deployments, QLC-based all-flash arrays for capacity-oriented applications, and hybrid flash arrays for price-sensitive workloads. Despite the uncertain macro, the enterprise spending environment has remained steady, driven by priority investments in digital and cloud transformations. Organizations around the globe want to learn how NetApp can increase the performance and reliability of these transformational projects, while helping reduce cost, risk, and complexity. Our ability to address a broad range of customer problems, while also optimizing cloud and IT investments makes NetApp more resilient to a potential further slowdown than many of our peers. Just as our customers are looking to save while transforming, we, too, must be agile in our response to the dynamic macro. We will continue to invest into areas of high return to drive growth, while at the same time moderating spending elsewhere. In closing, we delivered a great quarter, kicking off a strong start to FY 2023. Customer priorities are increasingly aligned, with the solutions that we uniquely provide. You are seeing evidence of that in the strong growth of our revenue, billings, and profitability. I am proud of the NetApp team's focus, execution and disciplined operational management in navigating this dynamic environment. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to walk through the details of our outstanding Q1.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion. Number one, as George highlighted, we had an outstanding Q1 in a dynamic environment with all-time Q1 company highs for billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS, despite an uncertain macro and unprecedented FX headwinds. Number two, our Public Cloud business had an outstanding quarter, with excellent performance by our cloud volume service offerings from AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, which collectively grew ARR over 100% year-over-year. We also saw improved execution in our CloudOps portfolio. Number three, as George mentioned, we continue to see healthy customer engagement and demand trends. Like everyone on this call, we are mindful of the complexity in both the macro backdrop and supply chain. We will remain extremely disciplined in running our business, while continuing to invest in our key strategic initiatives. And number four, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for revenue, margins, EPS, free cash flow and Public Cloud ARR, even when factoring in a 3 to 4-point revenue headwind from FX versus the 2-point FX headwind contemplated in our guide provided last quarter. Now to the details. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. In Q1, despite elevated freight and logistical expense, significant component cost premiums and unprecedented FX headwinds, we delivered solid revenue with both operating margin and EPS coming in above the high end of guidance. Strong execution yielded Q1 billings of $1.56 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.59 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 4-point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been up 18% and 13% year-over-year, respectively. Our solid Q1 results were driven by broad-based demand across our portfolio and geographies. Our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3.5 of the 9 points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.46 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue as we go through fiscal 2023. Product revenue of $786 million increased 8% year-over-year. Consistent with growth in fiscal 2022, software product revenue of $476 million increased 15% year-over-year, driven by the value of our ONTAP software and data services. Total Q1 recurring support revenue of $598 million increased 3% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q1 at $584 million, up 73% year-over-year, driven by strength in Cloud Storage services, led by Azure NetApp Files, AWS FSx for ONTAP and Google CVS. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $132 million, up 67% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.  Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $730 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 46% of total revenue, a new record for NetApp. We ended Q1 with $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Q1 marks the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 67%, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 66% in Q1. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 50%, including a two-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 70% was again accretive to the corporate average. The sequential increase in Public Cloud gross margin was driven by improving software mix within our Public Cloud business. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as we continue to scale the business and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. Q1 highlighted the strong leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 23%, despite the ongoing supply chain and currency headwinds. EPS of $1.20 came in nicely ahead of guidance. Cash flow from operations was $281 million and free cash flow was $216 million. During Q1, we had strong cash collections, while we continued to invest in inventory that included paying substantial premiums for constrained trailing-edge analog parts. This purchasing strategy allowed us to meet as much customer demand as possible, but was clearly a headwind to cash flow and gross margins. We are seeing early signs of relief in supply availability. The timing of a full supply recovery remains uncertain, however, as our inventory levels start to normalize, it will be a tailwind to free cash flow as we go through fiscal 2023. During Q1, we repurchased $350 million in stock and paid out $110 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $460 million to shareholders, representing 213% of free cash flow. We closed Q1 with $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2023 guidance. Our revenue guide of 6% to 8% growth year-over-year now includes 3 to 4 points of FX headwind versus the 2 point headwind assumed in our original guidance provided last quarter. We will continue to grow and invest in our Public Cloud business and expect to exit fiscal 2023 with Public Cloud ARR of $780 to $820 million. At the ARR mid-point, we expect our Public Cloud segment to drive 4 points of total company revenue growth. In fiscal 2023, we expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and logistical expenses from supply constraints continue to weigh on product margins. Adding to these product cost overhangs is an additional 1 point from incremental FX headwinds. As you know, the vast majority of our bill of materials is procured in US dollars. We are cautiously optimistic that supply constraints will ease further in the second half of our fiscal year, reducing our dependence on procuring parts at significant premiums. We should also start to see a benefit from declining prices for our hardware components. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time. Despite the incremental currency headwinds, we remain committed to driving operating margin of 23% to 24% and EPS of $5.40 to $5.60 for the full year. Like all of you, we are closely monitoring the demand signals and broader macro trends. As George noted, customer engagement and demand remain healthy, however, given the fluidity of the environment, we will continue to be appropriately measured in our outlook and extremely disciplined with our spending envelope. We continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. Now on to Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.595 billion and $1.745 billion which, at the midpoint implies a 7% increase year-over-year, including 4 points of currency headwinds. We expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, and operating margin to be approximately 23%. We anticipate our tax-rate to be between 21% to 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $1.28 and $1.38 per share. Assumed in our Q2 guidance is net interest expense of $5 million and a share count of approximately 223 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in Q1, as a result the year is off to a strong start. I\u2019ll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks Mike. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please, go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. And wow, congratulations to you and your team. Great results. My question to you is, look, the past two, two-and-a-half years have been very challenging with COVID. And it appears that NetApp has stepped it up by going the extra distance to procuring the shortages of parts, paying premiums and delivering to the customers. Does this set you up with relationships and customer expectations and even deeper, longer visibility and opportunities? I'm just kind of wondering, because it seems like you walked down this aisle of going way beyond just what a normal agreement would be. And it seems like things are even deeper now in a positive way. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you, Jim. I think, first of all, we continue to see demand ahead of supply. We had a broad-based book of business in Q1, with healthy demand trends, and we're doing everything we can to meet customer expectations by procuring parts in as many ways as we can. We think that, that helps us to be able to deliver on the promises that we make to customers. I think equally importantly, we broaden the range of capabilities that we bring to customers, particularly with our cloud offerings, our cloud storage and our cloud operations portfolio that now address a vast range of both digital and cloud transformation. And so the combination of meeting expectations for the day-to-day business, as well as being part of their go-forward transformation, allowing them to kind of make their businesses a lot more digital and cloud capable, is helping us broaden our exposure to new buyers and customers and deepen relationships within existing buyers, as well as net new buyers. So I'm excited about what the year ahead holds for us.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Jim. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. A couple of questions for me. Just on the outlook and saying that you're kind of observing signs for macro conditions, just any sense of, in your conversations, kind of any change in tone or what you would be looking for to kind of detect whether you were seeing any of that macro impact? And then maybe second question, just whether there's any benefit that you're seeing from memory prices kind of coming down that maybe offset some of the higher componentry costs that you're seeing elsewhere? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Good afternoon, Meta. Thanks for the question. I think, first of all, we have a broad book of business across geographies, customer segments, vertical industries. And so, we monitor the discussions going on with our field teams and customers about their intent to purchase, the project that they want to do with us. So I think, clearly, we continue to see healthy investment in the transformational projects. I think that we are fortunate, given the work we've done in the cloud business, to be able to participate in those projects in a truly unique way, whether they are in modernizing data centers or migrating them to cloud. I think that we continue to see new application deployment and business process transformations continue to take priority in customer budgets. In public sector, we saw the late start to public sector spending now start to create opportunity for us to participate, particularly with agencies that were generally closed to doing business during COVID, some of the more defense and security focused agencies that we couldn't really engage with because of the COVID trend. So overall, a good balanced book-of-business, priority on the transformational projects and then really kind of engagement across our customers showing a steady rebound from two years of COVID delays. Mike, do you want to talk about the supply?\nMike Berry: Sure. Thanks, George. Meta, thanks for the question. So as we talked about on the earnings call last quarter, we did expect and we still do expect the memory prices to be a slight headwind in the first half and then moving to a tailwind in the second half. All the surveys and discussions we've had certainly support that. As you know, we did add a good bit of inventory after the issue that we saw with SSDs in Q4. So it will take a little bit of time to work through the P&L. And all of that is in our guidance, by the way, that we do expect to see memory prices become a little bit more of a tailwind in the second half.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Meta. Next question.\nOperator: The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. I was wondering, as we think about the growth in Public Cloud ARR up 73%, how should we think about the length of the contracts. Has there been any change, or I'm trying to think about how quickly that will continue to flow through in terms of cloud growth overall. Just as you talk to your customers in the environment that we're in right now, have you seen any shifts in contract length or timing of when you expect things to be recognized? And then I was just wondering, from a cost perspective, you mentioned being a little bit more cautious, I guess. I'm just wondering, are you still planning on increasing headcount. I mean, how cautious are you thinking when you look at your OpEx? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. In terms of cloud contracts, we have a broad book-of-business. We have contracts that are subscription contracts. They're usually a couple of years in duration, so they can move around a bit. And then we have, of course, consumption type contracts, which are the type of agreements that we work on with customers in the kind of first-party cloud services, so a broad range. I think overall, we see strong demand for our offerings, because they help our customers use the cloud more efficiently. Our storage cloud services are much more efficient than sort of hyperscaler native services, so you can get more performance for less dollars using our capabilities. And then, of course, our cloud operations portfolio directly addressed customer concerns about cloud spending by optimizing their overall usage of compute and storage and network on the Public Cloud. Mike?\nMike Berry: Yes. And keep in mind, too, as well, Shannon, that ARRs are \u2013 is what we expect to recognize during the next 12 months. So, those \u2013 that you'll see ARR tie pretty closely to revenue. And then on your headcount question, as we talked about, hey, we're going to be very disciplined. We want to continue to invest in the areas that are going to drive growth, specifically around cloud as well as some of our sales headcount. We are taking a look at just like everybody else, making sure that we reallocate dollars to drive growth, and we'll be very prudent around other additions.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you. And next question.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow up on the Public Cloud side. The ARR in Q1 seems to have come in better than expected, up 6% to 8% organically. It looks like the upside was driven by some of the issues being resolved like maybe in the Spot. But why not more positive on the ARR exiting the year? Is FX impact in this business? And can you talk about maybe some of the other issues that you're working on? When do you expect them to get resolved? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, we're pleased to the start of the year. I think our cloud storage portfolio is really strong. And as we said, we are in the early innings with Amazon and Google, and there's plenty of opportunity to expand our business with them. We are doing the work to be able to do so. With regard to the cloud operations portfolio, we've had a really good start to the year in the Spot portfolio, which \u2013 where we've had new sales leadership, strong disciplined execution in the product team and in the field organization, and I feel pretty good about the focus so far. I think on Cloud Insights, we still have some more work to do, particularly sharpening the parts of the market that we attack and the execution on customer success motions in that part of the business. So we're pleased, we're at the end of the first quarter, if we see more strength at that point, we can talk about the full year guidance. But I feel really good about reiterating our guidance. It's a strong growth target for the full year for our cloud portfolio. And at the start of the year, we're off to a great start.\nSidney Ho: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Sidney. Next question?\nOperator: The next question will come from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Hey, guys. Thanks again for taking my question. Maybe this is a question for both George and Mike. So when I think about the profitability and the challenges that the industry is facing, it looks like just quickly from our math, that the Hybrid Cloud incremental gross margin might be at the lowest level that we've seen in quite some time, kind of below 20%. And should we \u2013 so therefore, if I think about the business going forward, are we at the low-water mark from product gross margin this quarter given your commentary about supply chain getting better? And should we expect sort of a sequential improvement in product gross margin going forward, or is there something else under the hood like are we expecting some sort of Public Cloud gross margin pressure in the back half as well? I'm just trying to triangulate kind of where we are today versus where we might be in three to four quarters from now? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Yeah. Hey, David, it's Mike. So, great question. So let's go through that. As we talked about on the call last quarter, we did expect and without the incremental impact of FX, it would have been true that, we expected product gross margins to be at its lowest in Q4. Q1 came in pretty much as we expected. When we gave the guidance at the midpoint, we're saying, hey, relatively consistent in Q2. To your point, keep in mind that on a year-over-year basis, we are paying, call it \u2013 and we talked about this a couple of calls ago, about $60 million a quarter for premiums. We expect that to continue in Q2 and then get better as we go through the rest of the year. In addition to Meta's earlier question, we do expect memory prices to get a little bit better in the second half. Again, all of that is baked into our guidance when we gave our full year number. So all else being equal, no crazy on the supply chain things happening or things that we don't know of at this time. We would expect gross margins to continue to improve as we go throughout the year.\nDavid Vogt: And then maybe can I just follow up, Mike. So you may be leveraging what Meta had asked before on operating expenses. Was there anything sort of unique in the first quarter? It certainly appeared to us, at least, maybe, there might have been some tight cost controls on your end to keep sales and marketing looks like flat year-over-year and down fairly meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. As supply chain gets better and revenue continues to ramp, should we expect some incremental dollars to flow back into the OpEx lines over the next couple of quarters?\nMike Berry: Yes. So thanks for the question. So, overall, we were down about $20 million quarter-on-quarter total company. To your point, sales and marketing was down about 7%. There were three major moves -- movements in OpEx quarter-over-quarter. That was -- FX gave us about a $10 million benefit, because the stronger dollar means lower OpEx. Q1, David, we always have a reset of incentives, incentive pay as well as commissions, and that -- part of that flowed through sales and marketing. And then in R&D, mostly you saw the addition of Instaclustr. Also, keep in mind that marketing, one of the big variables there is just marketing spend program timing. Q1 is typically a lower program spend for marketing. So those are the three big movements. And as Meta asked as well, hey, we're looking hard at making sure that we're investing in growth. Candidly, sales and marketing will be one of those areas, especially as it looks to drive growth in cloud.\nDavid Vogt: Perfect. Thanks, Mike. Thanks again, guys.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks David. Next question.\nOperator: The next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.\nMichael Tsvetanov: Yes. Thank you. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. How should we think about your recent price increases flowing through the model from a timing perspective? I guess, really what I'm trying to get at is, how much of your fiscal 2023 revenue growth can be attributed to those price increases? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, we've implemented, as we have shared before, two price increases. And we are seeing our sales teams being disciplined to be able to capture the value of those price increases. The important thing to note is, customers' budget in dollars, they don't get incremental IT budget just because vendors raise prices. So I do not see the fact that our revenue is strong being tied to price increases. I think customers spend and you got to go get your fair share or more than your fair share of their spend. And so we'll continue to monitor how the supply base evolves, and we'll adjust pricing -- if we need to take another action, we will do that at the appropriate point in time. Right now, I don't see the need to do that.\nMichael Tsvetanov: Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Michael. Next question?\nOperator: The next question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.\nRod Hall: Yes. Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to dig into the Americas commercial revenue a little bit, just the trajectory there. What I see there is quarter-on-quarter deterioration and a little bit worse than normal seasonality to about 12%. The last couple of years, you were just below 8% quarter-on-quarter, and that's off of an April quarter that was just flat seasonally. So it was weak seasonally in April as well. And then if I look at the year-over-year on that line, it was just under 7% year-over-year growth deteriorating from 10.5% last quarter and then about 20% the quarter before. So it looks like it's moderated a little bit. And I just wondered if you guys could maybe dig into what you think is happening there. Is there a demand fluctuation in that particular line, or is there something else going on?\nMike Berry : Yes. Hey, Rod, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So the big driver there is -- and we'll go back to what we talked about last time, it's really supply chain in terms of how it impacts the GOs on a quarterly basis. You did see nice growth in USPS, which was great. EMEA and APAC grew as well. So that was more really an issue of supply chain where we were able to place our product versus any change in demand on a quarter-on-quarter basis.\nRod Hall: And Mike, can I just follow that up and asked, did you guys make a decision to allocate less to that particular group of customers, or is there any -- could you give us any more color on why maybe they got less supply than some of these other regions?\nMike Berry : Yes. So it's a nuanced answer, Rod. And no, we didn't decide to do that. It depends on what availability we have, what customers are purchasing, when those purchase orders came in, linearity matters. So hey, there's a lot that goes in there, but no, there was no outright decision or direction that way. It just was how it fell in the quarter.\nRod Hall: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.\nMike Berry : Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Rod. Next question.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have two as well. I'll ask them together. I guess, first off on an organic basis on the top line, it looks like you're actually raising your revenue guide by about 150 basis points or so given the FX issues you have. I'd love to just understand what is driving the better organic performance? Is it end-demand trends that are better or share gain and kind of which buckets are you see it on? That will be really good to understand. And then secondly, and Mike, it could just be for you, I think, but you beat Q1 by $0.10. Your Q2 guide, I think, it's about 5 to 6 ahead of The Street, but you're not raising your full year numbers really on an EPS basis. So I guess, what are you seeing or not seeing that's not letting you flow the upside in the first half on the EPS line to the back half? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I'll take the demand one, and then Mike will cover the EPS. First of all, we're pleased with the book-of-business we saw in Q1. Our teams are engaged with our customers deeply across all of the segments and geographies. And as you see from our results, we had a really good balanced book-of-business with strength across all of the geographies. I think with regard to the year ahead, listen, we are one quarter in. We feel really good about the progress. We are reiterating our guidance. Yes, you correctly note that we saw incremental FX headwinds from the time we guided. So by reiterating guidance today, it actually shows that we have confidence in our business through the course of the year. I would say if you ask me what's sort of top of mind for me at the moment, it really is about having supply, and I wish I could just get to confidence on having all of the supply we need to meet demand, right? And I think that is the place we continue to do the work. We feel that it's stabilizing, but supply is still behind demand.\nMike Berry : Hey, Amit, on the EPS number, as you appropriately noted, we actually are raising the full year number when you take into account the incremental FX impact. And when you flow that through, I think that you're going to see that, there is actually a side ways EPS as well, although albeit not as much as revenue. So we feel \u2013 hey, we feel good about the year. We have \u2013 we've talked several times about reiterating the EPS as well as the operating cash flow number in an uncertain time. So we feel good about that range. As George said, hey, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. We'll take a look at it, but we are certainly very disciplined around our spending and targeted to make sure that we hit both profit and cash goals.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Amit. Next question.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. It looks like your all-flash ARR growth rates slowed somewhat from last quarter. It was up 7% versus up 12% last quarter, anything to read into that as far as trends and the transition to all-flash from customers, or was it just up against tough comps, supply constraints or other reasons? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: The combination of some supply constraints and also we have an FX headwind to product revenue. I think given the percentage of our total book of business being all flash, you would assume that FX would affect it the same as our total book of business, so substantial headwind. I also think, it's too early to comment, but at times like this in the past, we have seen customers choose to buy more economic configurations in certain cases. So we had a strong quarter in our hybrid flash segment, which is really targeting customers who have \u2013 want to buy the most cost-effective configuration. And so we'll continue to monitor that. It's one quarter in, so I wouldn't call that a trend yet.\nMatt Sheerin: Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question.\nOperator: The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAngela Zhang: This is Angela Zhang on for Samik Chatterjee. I just wanted to dig into the comment you made about over 100% growth in ARR from AWS, Azure and Google Cloud combined. I'm guessing the majority of that contribution comes from ANF just given its scale right now, but \u2013 do you mind parsing through how each one is trending and where you're seeing the greatest traction and where you might see it going in the future?\nMike Berry: Hi, Angela, it's Mike. As we've talked about, ANF is the largest portion of CVS. All three of the products with the hyperscalers are performing well. We're not going to go into the trends individually. They're all at a different part of their stage in terms of go-to-market and product, but all three of them did well in the quarter relative to how they were. And yes, ANF continues to be the largest portion of that, and ANF performed quite well in the quarter.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Angela. Next question.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Two follow-ups. Within your cloud data services, how should I think about the current mix of cloud storage versus cloud op? And how would this mix change over the next four to six quarters? And I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: In cloud storage, as we said, is 60%. And we think that the mix should stay relatively stable over the next several quarters.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Because I'm looking at your AFA, All-flash array commentary you mentioned and it seems like if I were to just take your fiscal year 2023 guide, the AFA growth would accelerate FY 2022 AFA growth was 20%, this year tracking to low teen. And I was just trying to better understand if cloud data services will provide an uplift in addition to installed base that is upgrading.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, we saw customer challenges in multiple ways, right? I think, unlike some other players in the market, we can solve it through a cloud-based solution. We can solve it through a hybrid flash solution, as well as managed service offerings. So we\u2019re going to do what customers want and we\u2019re going to give them the full range of our portfolio. I think our flash offerings are strong. We have certainly been affected by the macro. But as we have shared before, the vast majority of our cloud growth comes from outside our on-premises installed base. So most of those customers are not buying our AFAs, they're buying new stuff.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for the color.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks Mehdi. Next question?\nOperator: The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please, go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great result. I have two quick ones. First one for George. How much visibility do you have into FY 2023? Because typical lead time to storage products is about two to three months. But with FY guidance reiterated, is it safe to assume you're starting to have some visibility into the back half of FY 2023? So any color on the visibility would be helpful. And then a quick one for Mike. Conversely, given the uncertain macro, especially heading into calendar 2023, how do you think about your operating leverage? I understand you have some ARR and subscriptions. But if product revenues are down, typical number, down 10% hypothetically, how do you think about margins and earnings in that environment, Mike? Thank you very much for taking my question.\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to visibility, listen, we are engaged in conversations with customers. And as I said in my prepared remarks and the -- what we see within customers is, there are transformational projects that continue to receive the benefit of spending, right? These could be digital business process enablement. It could be data and analytics to better understand and target the customer base. It could be cloud migrations and accelerated application deployment. Those are all getting funded, right? And we get to participate in all of those. I think we have certainly more visibility into some of the larger accounts and spending plans, just because of the range of engagement we have with them, than maybe the smaller accounts, which are a smaller part of our total business. With regard to what we see going on, it's steady demand. As we said, some of our clients are recovering from two years of COVID pandemic. So while they may not be as excited about what the next year holds, they're still recovering from two years of delayed spending. And so these projects are moving forward. And so, we continue to work with our customers on their planning not only for this year, but also for the first half of next year, which comprises the finish of our fiscal year.\nMike Berry: And Krish, hey, on your last question, the way I would answer that is, we certainly look at different scenarios. You mentioned 10% down. No one on this call had said that that's what we think it would be. We've looked at our operating expenses, where we spend our money, where we would look to reallocate or reduce if we saw a different scenario than we're calling for the year. Also, hey, keep in mind one important note, which is the majority of the gross profit is still being generated by support, which we feel very good about. And cloud continues to be a bigger part of that. Based on the midpoint of the guidance by the end of the year, cloud will be about a little over 10% of the revenue and that of gross profit as well. So that provides a nice buffer. So we're looking at all those things as we go into the year, nothing certainly that we would pull the trigger on unless we saw different scenarios rolling out. Hopefully\u2026\nKrish Sankar: Thanks a lot, George. Thanks Mike. Yes, that is super helpful. Thank you very much.\nKris Newton: All right. Thank you, Krish. Next question.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nVictor Chiu: Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. If there was some back of the napkin math, that the Public Cloud NRR of 151% this quarter seems to implies strong Public Cloud ARR contributions from new customer bookings in the quarter relative to renewal expansion contributions. Is that an accurate assumption? And if so, were there specific drivers behind that this quarter? And how should we think about this dynamic going forward if we assume NRR continues to trend down as it has over the last several quarters?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, we've said that dollar-based net retention rate would come down over time. I think we said we've kind of stabilized around 120%, but we feel really good about the book-of-business we're adding. It will bump around a bit. New cohorts certainly are showing strong expansion trajectory, but I don't read anything particular into our book-of-business, right? I think we have really strong growth across the cloud portfolio, and we are acquiring a good new set of customers, especially with our hyperscaler routes to market. So there's plenty of opportunity ahead. We're going to continue to balance expansion with net new customer additions.\nVictor Chiu: Okay. Okay. So -- but is it right to think that baked into your kind of outlook that new bookings kind of play a bigger role? Is that kind of correct?\nGeorge Kurian: I mean, listen, I think that as the installed base and cloud gets to be a bigger and bigger number, the amount of new additions, they are very strong, will naturally become a smaller part of the total business. So we're not -- we don't feel badly about the new customer additions at all. It's just -- it's the law of large numbers catching up with you.\nVictor Chiu: Okay. Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Victor. Next question.\nOperator: The next question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you. Congrats on strong solid results and effectively the guidance raise here. George, you talked about some of your customer wins, and I believe this is one of the first times, if not the first time where you talked about data ONTAP enabling better AI workload data management and being a key portion of these wins. Can you double click into that and talk about what's inherent in ONTAP that enables to AI workload data management?\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. First of all, it isn't the first time we have talked about AI. It's been a strong contributor to our business over many quarters now. We have three things that we're excited about. First is the technology underpinning AI works great on file-based data, image analysis, natural language processing. Those are all tied to analyzing files. The second is AI requires high-performance training infrastructure to make the algorithm smart. And so high-performance file storage, we are the market leader without question in that part of the market. And I think over the last year, the third point I'll raise is, we have done really good work over the last few years with NVIDIA to build reference designs that combine their technology software vendors and our infrastructure. So I'm super excited about the opportunities ahead in that part of the market. And as you saw from my prepared remarks, we cannot only address it on-prem, but uniquely address it on the cloud as well.\nNehal Chokshi: Great. Thank you very much.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Nehal. Next question.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fox: It's Steve Fox from Fox Advisors. One quick question from me. Can you just talk about the hybrid storage rates a little bit more? It looks like they grew double digit year-over-year. I'm not sure the last one that happened. And it sounded like that mix was happening in the prior quarter as well. How much more do you think you have to deal with that negative mix shift in the product sales, especially since you're starting to see a loosening up of NAND and DRAM? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I don't see hybrid flash strength as a negative. I just think that we offer a broad range of capabilities for customers in certain workloads. Hybrid flash is obviously the right answer, because it gives you the combination of large amounts of capacity at a really cost-effective price point and with caching technology, the ability to generate good enough performance for those use cases. So, we actually feel like having cloud all-flash arrays, capacity flash arrays and hybrid flash arrays is the right answer for customers. And we do that not just a file and block, but also increasingly an object.\nSteve Fox: Okay. Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you, Steve. Next question.\nOperator: The next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Wang: Hey, guys. It's actually George Wang on behalf of Tim Long here. Congrats again on the quarter. So I have two questions. Firstly, just kind of holding on the cloud ops in terms of future tuck-in acquisitions, last time you guys talked about the folding in the first half just given kind of a valuation has come in rapidly for the private market companies, is there any sort of shift in the strategy in terms of maybe kind of pick up some private kind of near-term?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, we are disciplined acquirers. We have done well with the start to the year. That doesn't mean that we don't have more work to do to integrate the acquisitions we've already completed, especially both CloudCheckr and Instaclustr, right? So we're deeply involved in doing that work. That work should be wrapped up soon, right, at least the preponderant majority of that work. And we continue to monitor the landscape. We won't rule out doing things that they are massively advantaged, but we're also just trying to be balanced, disciplined acquirers so that we can make sure that the acquisitions we already have done are off to strong starts.\nGeorge Wang: Great. So my follow-up is, just if you can unpack on the billings and the deferred both are kind of de-metrics. So when I look at the billings, so it decelerated by 3%, but that's probably the kind of FX you guys mentioned also from maybe some seasonality, some tough compare with versus quarter last year. But it's good to see deferred rev actually accelerated. So maybe you can unpack it a little bit, maybe talk about any update you saw from kind of software support renewal front?\nMike Berry: Sure, George. So, hey, a couple of answers to that. So thanks for asking about billings. So keep in mind that it was 13% this quarter, but 18% on a constant currency basis. So it actually did accelerate quarter-over-quarter. I believe it was 16% last quarter. If I missed that, I apologize. What drove the billings growth mostly in Q4 of last year was, as you know, its revenue plus change in deferred. Most of that growth was from support. We had a very good support quarter in Q4. You saw that in the deferred revenue results. This quarter, it was nice. Support did well. Again, but really, it was cloud that drove a good bit of the billings growth. So the 13% as reported, cloud was about 7.5% of that. So it was a big driver. And a lot of that was what George talked about, us getting our feet under us again around CloudOps because that's where you'll end up doing subscription arrangements. So that is to compare on billings. Again, keep in mind, on an FX-adjusted basis, really strong billings quarter.\nGeorge Wang: Okay, great. Thanks. \nMike Berry: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks, George. Next question.\nOperator: The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please, go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. On the Public Cloud ARR, can you just parse through what was organic versus inorganic in the quarter? And last quarter, you had noted that you were expecting the trajectory to accelerate as you go through the course of the year. Is that still your view? Or do you expect that you sort of turned it around a little bit faster than you thought and that trajectory sort of maybe doesn't really accelerate from here? And I have a quick follow-up on gross margins.\nMike Berry: Sure. So, hey, Wamsi, thanks for the question. So let's go through the ARR results in the quarter. So as we expected, Instaclustr came in right around $34 million, $35 million. And as we talked about, we expected to see good growth through the year, a little bit of acceleration in the second half. That's still where we are. So organic, I would -- I'm going to define that as everything except for Instaclustr because we had CloudCheckr in Q4, grew by $45 million and then Instaclustr was about $34 million to $35 million. That gets you to the $585 million. That's about a 9% growth quarter-on-quarter. We would expect Q2 to be, call it, between 10% and 11% growth on the $584 million and then the second half, right around 11%. So a little bit more, not much. It's certainly nowhere near -- well, maybe it's an old hockey stick where they weren't curved at all. But -- so a little bit of growth but not much, and that gets us to about the $800 million midpoint. So we feel really good about the rest of the year and how we need to grow that on a quarter-on-quarter basis.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. That's really helpful color, Mike. And then on gross margin, your fiscal 2Q gross margin guide, it's roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, but you are getting significant positive revenue leverage and 5% sequential at the midpoint. You got a positive mix from federal potentially. So what would you say are some of the key offsets outside of FX, or do you see the opportunity to potentially deliver some upside to those gross margin numbers? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Yes. So thanks for the question. The big mover there is at that kind of quarter-on-quarter basis, keep in mind, hey, the USPS had a really good Q1. That's much more of a programmatic spend now versus a big bump that you used to see in Q2. We expect premiums to continue to be relatively consistent. And then while, again, we expect the memory prices to help, that's really a second half of the year, because we have to work through some of the inventory that we very appropriately put on the balance sheet before. So we feel good about that number. We'll see. And here's a big thing, mix really matters on gross margin, not only within the product, but also within those products in terms of entry level versus some of the higher ones. So there's a lot of moving parts. We feel good about it. Again, we expect the second half to see that product margin increase as we go through the year.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you so much. \nKris Newton: Thank you, Wamsi. Next question.\nOperator: The last question will come from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJason Ader: Yes, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, George, I wanted to ask you about the environment that we're in right now in terms of whether it's had an impact on demand for Spot relative to the last couple of years. Like have you seen any acceleration in interest? Maybe it's not actual ARR yet, but it's pipeline. It's just -- I know that a lot of customers are scrutinizing cloud costs right now. And it seems like Spot is really a perfect type of tool for them in this type of climate.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. Clearly, the Spot portfolio, which helps with both resource constraints in terms of talent with automation as well as the raw cost of cloud spend and kind of keeping track of where you're spending in the cloud is perfectly set up for this environment. We are off to a good start to the year with our Spot portfolio. We intend to widen and broaden customer engagement in line with the pattern that you just appropriately identified.\nJason Ader: Okay. So I guess is that -- does that mean that you have seen an acceleration in interest? I guess, I didn't catch the some of comment.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, customers are appropriately scrutinizing their cloud spend. And I think as they begin to understand that we have a tool set to help with them, we're seeing good proof-of-concept, good trials going on in the Spot portfolio.\nJason Ader: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. I'll turn it back over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year, setting company records for Q1 billings, revenue, gross margin dollars, operating income and EPS. Despite the uncertain macro, the enterprise spending environment has remained steady, driven by priority investments in digital and cloud transformation. Our ability to address the challenges created by these initiatives with a broad portfolio drives our growing relevance with organizations globally. We will continue to maintain our focus on our top priority, while driving disciplined execution and operational management to deliver increasing shareholder value. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion. Number one, as George highlighted, we had an outstanding Q1 in a dynamic environment with all-time Q1 company highs for billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS, despite an uncertain macro and unprecedented FX headwinds. Number two, our Public Cloud business had an outstanding quarter, with excellent performance by our cloud volume service offerings from AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, which collectively grew ARR over 100% year-over-year. We also saw improved execution in our CloudOps portfolio. Number three, as George mentioned, we continue to see healthy customer engagement and demand trends. Like everyone on this call, we are mindful of the complexity in both the macro backdrop and supply chain. We will remain extremely disciplined in running our business, while continuing to invest in our key strategic initiatives. And number four, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for revenue, margins, EPS, free cash flow and Public Cloud ARR, even when factoring in a 3 to 4-point revenue headwind from FX versus the 2-point FX headwind contemplated in our guide provided last quarter. Now to the details. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. In Q1, despite elevated freight and logistical expense, significant component cost premiums and unprecedented FX headwinds, we delivered solid revenue with both operating margin and EPS coming in above the high end of guidance. Strong execution yielded Q1 billings of $1.56 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.59 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 4-point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been up 18% and 13% year-over-year, respectively. Our solid Q1 results were driven by broad-based demand across our portfolio and geographies. Our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3.5 of the 9 points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.46 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue as we go through fiscal 2023. Product revenue of $786 million increased 8% year-over-year. Consistent with growth in fiscal 2022, software product revenue of $476 million increased 15% year-over-year, driven by the value of our ONTAP software and data services. Total Q1 recurring support revenue of $598 million increased 3% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q1 at $584 million, up 73% year-over-year, driven by strength in Cloud Storage services, led by Azure NetApp Files, AWS FSx for ONTAP and Google CVS. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $132 million, up 67% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.  Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $730 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 46% of total revenue, a new record for NetApp. We ended Q1 with $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Q1 marks the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 67%, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 66% in Q1. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 50%, including a two-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 70% was again accretive to the corporate average. The sequential increase in Public Cloud gross margin was driven by improving software mix within our Public Cloud business. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as we continue to scale the business and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. Q1 highlighted the strong leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 23%, despite the ongoing supply chain and currency headwinds. EPS of $1.20 came in nicely ahead of guidance. Cash flow from operations was $281 million and free cash flow was $216 million. During Q1, we had strong cash collections, while we continued to invest in inventory that included paying substantial premiums for constrained trailing-edge analog parts. This purchasing strategy allowed us to meet as much customer demand as possible, but was clearly a headwind to cash flow and gross margins. We are seeing early signs of relief in supply availability. The timing of a full supply recovery remains uncertain, however, as our inventory levels start to normalize, it will be a tailwind to free cash flow as we go through fiscal 2023. During Q1, we repurchased $350 million in stock and paid out $110 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $460 million to shareholders, representing 213% of free cash flow. We closed Q1 with $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2023 guidance. Our revenue guide of 6% to 8% growth year-over-year now includes 3 to 4 points of FX headwind versus the 2 point headwind assumed in our original guidance provided last quarter. We will continue to grow and invest in our Public Cloud business and expect to exit fiscal 2023 with Public Cloud ARR of $780 to $820 million. At the ARR mid-point, we expect our Public Cloud segment to drive 4 points of total company revenue growth. In fiscal 2023, we expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and logistical expenses from supply constraints continue to weigh on product margins. Adding to these product cost overhangs is an additional 1 point from incremental FX headwinds. As you know, the vast majority of our bill of materials is procured in US dollars. We are cautiously optimistic that supply constraints will ease further in the second half of our fiscal year, reducing our dependence on procuring parts at significant premiums. We should also start to see a benefit from declining prices for our hardware components. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time. Despite the incremental currency headwinds, we remain committed to driving operating margin of 23% to 24% and EPS of $5.40 to $5.60 for the full year. Like all of you, we are closely monitoring the demand signals and broader macro trends. As George noted, customer engagement and demand remain healthy, however, given the fluidity of the environment, we will continue to be appropriately measured in our outlook and extremely disciplined with our spending envelope. We continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. Now on to Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.595 billion and $1.745 billion which, at the midpoint implies a 7% increase year-over-year, including 4 points of currency headwinds. We expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, and operating margin to be approximately 23%. We anticipate our tax-rate to be between 21% to 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $1.28 and $1.38 per share. Assumed in our Q2 guidance is net interest expense of $5 million and a share count of approximately 223 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in Q1, as a result the year is off to a strong start. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Sure. Thanks, George. Meta, thanks for the question. So as we talked about on the earnings call last quarter, we did expect and we still do expect the memory prices to be a slight headwind in the first half and then moving to a tailwind in the second half. All the surveys and discussions we've had certainly support that. As you know, we did add a good bit of inventory after the issue that we saw with SSDs in Q4. So it will take a little bit of time to work through the P&L. And all of that is in our guidance, by the way, that we do expect to see memory prices become a little bit more of a tailwind in the second half. Yes. And keep in mind, too, as well, Shannon, that ARRs are \u2013 is what we expect to recognize during the next 12 months. So, those \u2013 that you'll see ARR tie pretty closely to revenue. And then on your headcount question, as we talked about, hey, we're going to be very disciplined. We want to continue to invest in the areas that are going to drive growth, specifically around cloud as well as some of our sales headcount. We are taking a look at just like everybody else, making sure that we reallocate dollars to drive growth, and we'll be very prudent around other additions. Yeah. Hey, David, it's Mike. So, great question. So let's go through that. As we talked about on the call last quarter, we did expect and without the incremental impact of FX, it would have been true that, we expected product gross margins to be at its lowest in Q4. Q1 came in pretty much as we expected. When we gave the guidance at the midpoint, we're saying, hey, relatively consistent in Q2. To your point, keep in mind that on a year-over-year basis, we are paying, call it \u2013 and we talked about this a couple of calls ago, about $60 million a quarter for premiums. We expect that to continue in Q2 and then get better as we go through the rest of the year. In addition to Meta's earlier question, we do expect memory prices to get a little bit better in the second half. Again, all of that is baked into our guidance when we gave our full year number. So all else being equal, no crazy on the supply chain things happening or things that we don't know of at this time. We would expect gross margins to continue to improve as we go throughout the year. Yes. So thanks for the question. So, overall, we were down about $20 million quarter-on-quarter total company. To your point, sales and marketing was down about 7%. There were three major moves -- movements in OpEx quarter-over-quarter. That was -- FX gave us about a $10 million benefit, because the stronger dollar means lower OpEx. Q1, David, we always have a reset of incentives, incentive pay as well as commissions, and that -- part of that flowed through sales and marketing. And then in R&D, mostly you saw the addition of Instaclustr. Also, keep in mind that marketing, one of the big variables there is just marketing spend program timing. Q1 is typically a lower program spend for marketing. So those are the three big movements. And as Meta asked as well, hey, we're looking hard at making sure that we're investing in growth. Candidly, sales and marketing will be one of those areas, especially as it looks to drive growth in cloud. Yes. Hey, Rod, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So the big driver there is -- and we'll go back to what we talked about last time, it's really supply chain in terms of how it impacts the GOs on a quarterly basis. You did see nice growth in USPS, which was great. EMEA and APAC grew as well. So that was more really an issue of supply chain where we were able to place our product versus any change in demand on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Yes. So it's a nuanced answer, Rod. And no, we didn't decide to do that. It depends on what availability we have, what customers are purchasing, when those purchase orders came in, linearity matters. So hey, there's a lot that goes in there, but no, there was no outright decision or direction that way. It just was how it fell in the quarter. Thank you. Hey, Amit, on the EPS number, as you appropriately noted, we actually are raising the full year number when you take into account the incremental FX impact. And when you flow that through, I think that you're going to see that, there is actually a side ways EPS as well, although albeit not as much as revenue. So we feel \u2013 hey, we feel good about the year. We have \u2013 we've talked several times about reiterating the EPS as well as the operating cash flow number in an uncertain time. So we feel good about that range. As George said, hey, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. We'll take a look at it, but we are certainly very disciplined around our spending and targeted to make sure that we hit both profit and cash goals. Hi, Angela, it's Mike. As we've talked about, ANF is the largest portion of CVS. All three of the products with the hyperscalers are performing well. We're not going to go into the trends individually. They're all at a different part of their stage in terms of go-to-market and product, but all three of them did well in the quarter relative to how they were. And yes, ANF continues to be the largest portion of that, and ANF performed quite well in the quarter. And Krish, hey, on your last question, the way I would answer that is, we certainly look at different scenarios. You mentioned 10% down. No one on this call had said that that's what we think it would be. We've looked at our operating expenses, where we spend our money, where we would look to reallocate or reduce if we saw a different scenario than we're calling for the year. Also, hey, keep in mind one important note, which is the majority of the gross profit is still being generated by support, which we feel very good about. And cloud continues to be a bigger part of that. Based on the midpoint of the guidance by the end of the year, cloud will be about a little over 10% of the revenue and that of gross profit as well. So that provides a nice buffer. So we're looking at all those things as we go into the year, nothing certainly that we would pull the trigger on unless we saw different scenarios rolling out. Hopefully... Sure, George. So, hey, a couple of answers to that. So thanks for asking about billings. So keep in mind that it was 13% this quarter, but 18% on a constant currency basis. So it actually did accelerate quarter-over-quarter. I believe it was 16% last quarter. If I missed that, I apologize. What drove the billings growth mostly in Q4 of last year was, as you know, its revenue plus change in deferred. Most of that growth was from support. We had a very good support quarter in Q4. You saw that in the deferred revenue results. This quarter, it was nice. Support did well. Again, but really, it was cloud that drove a good bit of the billings growth. So the 13% as reported, cloud was about 7.5% of that. So it was a big driver. And a lot of that was what George talked about, us getting our feet under us again around CloudOps because that's where you'll end up doing subscription arrangements. So that is to compare on billings. Again, keep in mind, on an FX-adjusted basis, really strong billings quarter. Thank you. Sure. So, hey, Wamsi, thanks for the question. So let's go through the ARR results in the quarter. So as we expected, Instaclustr came in right around $34 million, $35 million. And as we talked about, we expected to see good growth through the year, a little bit of acceleration in the second half. That's still where we are. So organic, I would -- I'm going to define that as everything except for Instaclustr because we had CloudCheckr in Q4, grew by $45 million and then Instaclustr was about $34 million to $35 million. That gets you to the $585 million. That's about a 9% growth quarter-on-quarter. We would expect Q2 to be, call it, between 10% and 11% growth on the $584 million and then the second half, right around 11%. So a little bit more, not much. It's certainly nowhere near -- well, maybe it's an old hockey stick where they weren't curved at all. But -- so a little bit of growth but not much, and that gets us to about the $800 million midpoint. So we feel really good about the rest of the year and how we need to grow that on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Yes. So thanks for the question. The big mover there is at that kind of quarter-on-quarter basis, keep in mind, hey, the USPS had a really good Q1. That's much more of a programmatic spend now versus a big bump that you used to see in Q2. We expect premiums to continue to be relatively consistent. And then while, again, we expect the memory prices to help, that's really a second half of the year, because we have to work through some of the inventory that we very appropriately put on the balance sheet before. So we feel good about that number. We'll see. And here's a big thing, mix really matters on gross margin, not only within the product, but also within those products in terms of entry level versus some of the higher ones. So there's a lot of moving parts. We feel good about it. Again, we expect the second half to see that product margin increase as we go through the year."

            "content": "Thanks, Kris. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. We delivered a great start to the year, with company all-time Q1 highs for billings, revenue, gross margin dollars, operating income and EPS, fueled by broad-based demand across our portfolio and geographies. Achieving record results in the face of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, decades-high inflation and supply constraints underscores our disciplined operational management. As organizations accelerate their data-driven digital and cloud transformations, our relevance grows. We are helping customers navigate disruption with a modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management. Our opportunity is defined by the complexities created by rapid data and cloud growth, multi-cloud management and the adoption of next-generation technologies such as AI, Kubernetes and modern databases. The urgency to address these priorities increased with the COVID pandemic, and is further driven by the turbulent macro economy. Customers are searching for ways to reduce costs, improve flexibility, increase automation and accelerate application delivery in the public cloud, in their own data centers and in hybrid cloud environments. Our role in helping organizations achieve these transformation goals underpins our strategy and confidence in future growth. Let me share with you a couple of examples how data intensive applications like AI drive demand for both our Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud solutions. A global e-commerce company chose ONTAP AI for several AI workloads, including natural language processing, recommendation engines, and deep learning. Our ultra-high-performance storage, close partnership with NVIDIA and tight application integration were key to the win and the customer has realized better performance and reliability while reducing its operating costs and data center footprint. A Fortune 500 hyperscaler is adopting a hybrid cloud strategy to augment existing on-premises AI/ML workloads. It chose Azure NetApp Files to accelerate AI research and development on cutting-edge machine learning, training workloads for its AI business unit. The initial footprint consists of nearly one petabyte of Azure NetApp Files storage with plenty of opportunity for continued growth. Our AI solutions remove data processing bottlenecks at the edge, core, and cloud to enable more efficient data collection, accelerated AI workloads, faster time to insight, and smoother cloud integration. Now, let's turn to our Public Cloud segment performance for the quarter. In Q1, we continued to see strong demand for our Public Cloud services. Public Cloud ARR grew 73% year-over-year, exiting Q1 at $584 million. Public Cloud segment revenue grew 67% from Q1 a year ago to $132 million and dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 151% remains healthy. We continue to expand our Public Cloud customer base, the penetration into our Hybrid Cloud installed base, and the percentage of customers using multiple of our public cloud services. Storage services constitute approximately 60% of our Public Cloud ARR. We see significant opportunity for continued growth in this part of our business as we help customers migrate or deploy data-intensive, demanding storage workloads to the cloud. Early in Q1, AWS announced that FSx for NetApp ONTAP is SAP-certified. SAP certification for Azure NetApp Files has helped drive large, business-critical deployments on that service and we are excited about the potential to see similar workloads deployed on FSx for ONTAP. We recently announced that NetApp is the only cloud storage service provider certified and supported for use as an external data store for VMware Cloud environments, further expanding the opportunity for our public cloud storage services. We've long been known for the high levels of enterprise-grade data services, we bring to on-premises VMware environments and now, we can bring those same benefits to VMware workloads running in the major public clouds. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we made organizational changes to increase focus on renewal and expansion motions and refined our go-to-market execution to better address the cloud operations opportunity. These actions are starting to deliver results. In Q1, Spot bounced back, returning to its prior growth trajectory. Cloud Insights stabilized but remains a work in progress as we continue to optimize our sales and customer success motions. We delivered a substantial amount of innovation in our cloud operations portfolio with announcements of general availability of Spot Security, Spot PC, and Ocean for Apache Spark, providing fully managed serverless infrastructure for Apache Spark, on Google Cloud. We also completed the acquisition of Instaclustr, a leading provider of fully managed open-source database, pipeline, and workflow applications. We can now combine the Spot capabilities of continuous infrastructure optimization, automation, monitoring, and security with expertise in deploying and operating fully managed open-source applications to help our customers focus on their business goals, building and releasing leading-edge applications at speed. Onto our Hybrid Cloud segment. In Q1, Hybrid Cloud revenue grew 6% year-over-year, driven by solid product revenue growth of 8%. All-flash array annualized revenue run rate grew 7% year-over-year to $3 billion. All-flash penetration of our installed base grew to 32% of installed systems. FAS hybrid arrays again posted strong unit growth. The breadth of our storage systems portfolio enables us to address a broad range of customer business, technical and economic requirements. Under a single, unified management environment, we offer high-performance all-flash arrays for mission-critical, performance-sensitive deployments, QLC-based all-flash arrays for capacity-oriented applications, and hybrid flash arrays for price-sensitive workloads. Despite the uncertain macro, the enterprise spending environment has remained steady, driven by priority investments in digital and cloud transformations. Organizations around the globe want to learn how NetApp can increase the performance and reliability of these transformational projects, while helping reduce cost, risk, and complexity. Our ability to address a broad range of customer problems, while also optimizing cloud and IT investments makes NetApp more resilient to a potential further slowdown than many of our peers. Just as our customers are looking to save while transforming, we, too, must be agile in our response to the dynamic macro. We will continue to invest into areas of high return to drive growth, while at the same time moderating spending elsewhere. In closing, we delivered a great quarter, kicking off a strong start to FY 2023. Customer priorities are increasingly aligned, with the solutions that we uniquely provide. You are seeing evidence of that in the strong growth of our revenue, billings, and profitability. I am proud of the NetApp team's focus, execution and disciplined operational management in navigating this dynamic environment. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to walk through the details of our outstanding Q1. Thank you, Jim. I think, first of all, we continue to see demand ahead of supply. We had a broad-based book of business in Q1, with healthy demand trends, and we're doing everything we can to meet customer expectations by procuring parts in as many ways as we can. We think that, that helps us to be able to deliver on the promises that we make to customers. I think equally importantly, we broaden the range of capabilities that we bring to customers, particularly with our cloud offerings, our cloud storage and our cloud operations portfolio that now address a vast range of both digital and cloud transformation. And so the combination of meeting expectations for the day-to-day business, as well as being part of their go-forward transformation, allowing them to kind of make their businesses a lot more digital and cloud capable, is helping us broaden our exposure to new buyers and customers and deepen relationships within existing buyers, as well as net new buyers. So I'm excited about what the year ahead holds for us. Good afternoon, Meta. Thanks for the question. I think, first of all, we have a broad book of business across geographies, customer segments, vertical industries. And so, we monitor the discussions going on with our field teams and customers about their intent to purchase, the project that they want to do with us. So I think, clearly, we continue to see healthy investment in the transformational projects. I think that we are fortunate, given the work we've done in the cloud business, to be able to participate in those projects in a truly unique way, whether they are in modernizing data centers or migrating them to cloud. I think that we continue to see new application deployment and business process transformations continue to take priority in customer budgets. In public sector, we saw the late start to public sector spending now start to create opportunity for us to participate, particularly with agencies that were generally closed to doing business during COVID, some of the more defense and security focused agencies that we couldn't really engage with because of the COVID trend. So overall, a good balanced book-of-business, priority on the transformational projects and then really kind of engagement across our customers showing a steady rebound from two years of COVID delays. Mike, do you want to talk about the supply? Yes. In terms of cloud contracts, we have a broad book-of-business. We have contracts that are subscription contracts. They're usually a couple of years in duration, so they can move around a bit. And then we have, of course, consumption type contracts, which are the type of agreements that we work on with customers in the kind of first-party cloud services, so a broad range. I think overall, we see strong demand for our offerings, because they help our customers use the cloud more efficiently. Our storage cloud services are much more efficient than sort of hyperscaler native services, so you can get more performance for less dollars using our capabilities. And then, of course, our cloud operations portfolio directly addressed customer concerns about cloud spending by optimizing their overall usage of compute and storage and network on the Public Cloud. Mike? Listen, we're pleased to the start of the year. I think our cloud storage portfolio is really strong. And as we said, we are in the early innings with Amazon and Google, and there's plenty of opportunity to expand our business with them. We are doing the work to be able to do so. With regard to the cloud operations portfolio, we've had a really good start to the year in the Spot portfolio, which \u2013 where we've had new sales leadership, strong disciplined execution in the product team and in the field organization, and I feel pretty good about the focus so far. I think on Cloud Insights, we still have some more work to do, particularly sharpening the parts of the market that we attack and the execution on customer success motions in that part of the business. So we're pleased, we're at the end of the first quarter, if we see more strength at that point, we can talk about the full year guidance. But I feel really good about reiterating our guidance. It's a strong growth target for the full year for our cloud portfolio. And at the start of the year, we're off to a great start. Listen, we've implemented, as we have shared before, two price increases. And we are seeing our sales teams being disciplined to be able to capture the value of those price increases. The important thing to note is, customers' budget in dollars, they don't get incremental IT budget just because vendors raise prices. So I do not see the fact that our revenue is strong being tied to price increases. I think customers spend and you got to go get your fair share or more than your fair share of their spend. And so we'll continue to monitor how the supply base evolves, and we'll adjust pricing -- if we need to take another action, we will do that at the appropriate point in time. Right now, I don't see the need to do that. I'll take the demand one, and then Mike will cover the EPS. First of all, we're pleased with the book-of-business we saw in Q1. Our teams are engaged with our customers deeply across all of the segments and geographies. And as you see from our results, we had a really good balanced book-of-business with strength across all of the geographies. I think with regard to the year ahead, listen, we are one quarter in. We feel really good about the progress. We are reiterating our guidance. Yes, you correctly note that we saw incremental FX headwinds from the time we guided. So by reiterating guidance today, it actually shows that we have confidence in our business through the course of the year. I would say if you ask me what's sort of top of mind for me at the moment, it really is about having supply, and I wish I could just get to confidence on having all of the supply we need to meet demand, right? And I think that is the place we continue to do the work. We feel that it's stabilizing, but supply is still behind demand. The combination of some supply constraints and also we have an FX headwind to product revenue. I think given the percentage of our total book of business being all flash, you would assume that FX would affect it the same as our total book of business, so substantial headwind. I also think, it's too early to comment, but at times like this in the past, we have seen customers choose to buy more economic configurations in certain cases. So we had a strong quarter in our hybrid flash segment, which is really targeting customers who have \u2013 want to buy the most cost-effective configuration. And so we'll continue to monitor that. It's one quarter in, so I wouldn't call that a trend yet. In cloud storage, as we said, is 60%. And we think that the mix should stay relatively stable over the next several quarters. Listen, we saw customer challenges in multiple ways, right? I think, unlike some other players in the market, we can solve it through a cloud-based solution. We can solve it through a hybrid flash solution, as well as managed service offerings. So we're going to do what customers want and we're going to give them the full range of our portfolio. I think our flash offerings are strong. We have certainly been affected by the macro. But as we have shared before, the vast majority of our cloud growth comes from outside our on-premises installed base. So most of those customers are not buying our AFAs, they're buying new stuff. With regard to visibility, listen, we are engaged in conversations with customers. And as I said in my prepared remarks and the -- what we see within customers is, there are transformational projects that continue to receive the benefit of spending, right? These could be digital business process enablement. It could be data and analytics to better understand and target the customer base. It could be cloud migrations and accelerated application deployment. Those are all getting funded, right? And we get to participate in all of those. I think we have certainly more visibility into some of the larger accounts and spending plans, just because of the range of engagement we have with them, than maybe the smaller accounts, which are a smaller part of our total business. With regard to what we see going on, it's steady demand. As we said, some of our clients are recovering from two years of COVID pandemic. So while they may not be as excited about what the next year holds, they're still recovering from two years of delayed spending. And so these projects are moving forward. And so, we continue to work with our customers on their planning not only for this year, but also for the first half of next year, which comprises the finish of our fiscal year. Listen, we've said that dollar-based net retention rate would come down over time. I think we said we've kind of stabilized around 120%, but we feel really good about the book-of-business we're adding. It will bump around a bit. New cohorts certainly are showing strong expansion trajectory, but I don't read anything particular into our book-of-business, right? I think we have really strong growth across the cloud portfolio, and we are acquiring a good new set of customers, especially with our hyperscaler routes to market. So there's plenty of opportunity ahead. We're going to continue to balance expansion with net new customer additions. I mean, listen, I think that as the installed base and cloud gets to be a bigger and bigger number, the amount of new additions, they are very strong, will naturally become a smaller part of the total business. So we're not -- we don't feel badly about the new customer additions at all. It's just -- it's the law of large numbers catching up with you. Yes. First of all, it isn't the first time we have talked about AI. It's been a strong contributor to our business over many quarters now. We have three things that we're excited about. First is the technology underpinning AI works great on file-based data, image analysis, natural language processing. Those are all tied to analyzing files. The second is AI requires high-performance training infrastructure to make the algorithm smart. And so high-performance file storage, we are the market leader without question in that part of the market. And I think over the last year, the third point I'll raise is, we have done really good work over the last few years with NVIDIA to build reference designs that combine their technology software vendors and our infrastructure. So I'm super excited about the opportunities ahead in that part of the market. And as you saw from my prepared remarks, we cannot only address it on-prem, but uniquely address it on the cloud as well. Listen, I don't see hybrid flash strength as a negative. I just think that we offer a broad range of capabilities for customers in certain workloads. Hybrid flash is obviously the right answer, because it gives you the combination of large amounts of capacity at a really cost-effective price point and with caching technology, the ability to generate good enough performance for those use cases. So, we actually feel like having cloud all-flash arrays, capacity flash arrays and hybrid flash arrays is the right answer for customers. And we do that not just a file and block, but also increasingly an object. Listen, we are disciplined acquirers. We have done well with the start to the year. That doesn't mean that we don't have more work to do to integrate the acquisitions we've already completed, especially both CloudCheckr and Instaclustr, right? So we're deeply involved in doing that work. That work should be wrapped up soon, right, at least the preponderant majority of that work. And we continue to monitor the landscape. We won't rule out doing things that they are massively advantaged, but we're also just trying to be balanced, disciplined acquirers so that we can make sure that the acquisitions we already have done are off to strong starts. Yes. Clearly, the Spot portfolio, which helps with both resource constraints in terms of talent with automation as well as the raw cost of cloud spend and kind of keeping track of where you're spending in the cloud is perfectly set up for this environment. We are off to a good start to the year with our Spot portfolio. We intend to widen and broaden customer engagement in line with the pattern that you just appropriately identified. Listen, customers are appropriately scrutinizing their cloud spend. And I think as they begin to understand that we have a tool set to help with them, we're seeing good proof-of-concept, good trials going on in the Spot portfolio. Thanks, Kris. In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year, setting company records for Q1 billings, revenue, gross margin dollars, operating income and EPS. Despite the uncertain macro, the enterprise spending environment has remained steady, driven by priority investments in digital and cloud transformation. Our ability to address the challenges created by these initiatives with a broad portfolio drives our growing relevance with organizations globally. We will continue to maintain our focus on our top priority, while driving disciplined execution and operational management to deliver increasing shareholder value. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKris Newton: Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you, Kris. Welcome, everyone. We concluded FY '24 on a high note, demonstrating robust performance in the fourth quarter and building positive momentum as we step into FY '25. Our revenue for both Q4 and FY '24 exceeded the midpoint of our guidance, reflecting the strong growth of our expanded all-flash portfolio. Throughout FY '24, we maintained a high level of operational discipline, leading to company records for annual gross margin, operating margin, earnings per share, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. At the start of FY '24, we implemented a plan to enhance the performance of our storage business and build a more focused approach to the Public Cloud business, while managing the elements within our control in an uncertain macro environment. This plan has yielded tangible results, and our value proposition is resonating strongly in the marketplace. Customers are increasingly turning to NetApp to help them build intelligent data infrastructures and leverage the power of public and hybrid clouds for rapidly growing, data-intensive workloads like AI, cloud-native, open-source, and enterprise applications, while ensuring their data remains secure and protected from ransomware attacks. NetApp uniquely delivers a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, supporting any application, any data type, and spanning on-premises and multiple cloud environments. We deliver unparalleled simplicity of data management, and infrastructure and application deployment with consistent automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. In a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth, and escalating cybersecurity threats, we empower customers with the flexibility to rapidly deploy new applications, unify their data for AI, simplify cloud integration, and strengthen data protection. Now to the results of the quarter. We delivered robust year-over-year performance in our Hybrid Cloud segment, with revenue growth of 6% and product revenue growth of 8%. Strong customer demand for our broad portfolio of modern all-flash arrays, particularly the C-series capacity flash and ASA block optimized flash, was again ahead of our expectations. This demand propelled our all-flash array annualized revenue run rate to an all-time high at $3.6 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Early in Q1 of FY '25, we unveiled our new all-flash A series unified data storage products, offering customers enhanced performance and effective density at a lower cost than the previous A series generation. These products set a new standard for enterprise storage, enabling customers to turbocharge workloads ranging from traditional enterprise applications to GenAI. The new AFF A-series, coupled with our highly successful C-series and TAM expanding ASA product, position us to further increase our share in the all-flash market. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering was also a highlight of the quarter. Keystone provides cloud like management for hybrid cloud resources in a single subscription with flexible multiyear contracts that align storage costs with business needs, enabling rapid response to changing capacity and performance requirements. We consistently hear from customers that our integrated service level assurance, with performance, availability, ransomware recovery, and sustainability guarantees, is our differentiator. This has enabled us to accelerate growth by displacing competitors' storage-as-a-service subscriptions, winning new Keystone subscriptions, and expanding existing ones. FY '24 total contract value sales of Keystone more than doubled from the prior year to almost $150 million. We expect this momentum to continue and that FY '25 will be another significant growth year for Keystone. A leading semiconductor manufacturer selected Keystone as the vehicle to consolidate its storage needs. Initially aiming to select one vendor for block and another for file, we established ourselves as their single global standard for both environments, displacing the incumbent for block storage. This multi-year eight-figure deal allowed the customer to reduce the complexity and improve the availability of their storage environment. AI is a top priority for organizations as they seek to accelerate innovation, revolutionize operations, drive competitive advantage, and deliver superior solutions to their customers. Data management is essential for enterprise AI. Customers choose NetApp to support them at every phase of the AI lifecycle due to our high performance all-flash storage complemented by comprehensive data management capabilities that support requirements from data preparation, model training and tuning, retrieval-augmented generation or RAG, and inferencing, as well as requirements for responsible AI including model and data versioning, data governance and privacy. We continue to strengthen our position in enterprise AI, focusing on making it easier for customers to derive value from their AI investments. In Q4, we introduced NetApp AIPod with C-series capacity flash systems, delivering a new level of cost and performance, rack space utilization, and sustainability. In conjunction with Cisco, we updated FlexPod AI reference architectures to support the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, giving customers an end-to-end blueprint to efficiently design, deploy, and operate AI infrastructure. We were one of the first partners to complete the storage validation for NVIDIA OVX systems and at the start of Q1, we were the first to announce a full-stack OVX system. The NetApp AIPod with Lenovo ThinkSystem servers for NVIDIA OVX is optimized for GenAI and designed to support RAG. We announced much of this innovation at NVIDIA GTC, where we were honored to be recognized during the Keynote for our role in storing a significant portion of enterprises' unstructured data, which is the fuel for GenAI. Through our partnership with NVIDIA, we give customers the ability to talk directly to the large amount of existing data stored on NetApp on-premises and in the cloud, demonstrating the value of our installed base and this critical role we play in AI. We are the AI infrastructure of choice for one of the world's leading oil and gas companies. The company is developing its own large language model, using a high performance AI cluster with NetApp all-flash storage. They are now also building an AI Center of Excellence to support various departmental AI initiatives and have again selected NetApp storage for this part of their AI infrastructure, leveraging C-series to optimize price and performance. They are rapidly ramping up their AI infrastructure, building new models, and onboarding AI resources. They awarded us the deal over their AI server vendor because of our ability to remove to remove roadblocks in their AI workflows and accelerate the time to value from their AI investments. Public Cloud segment revenue was $152 million, up 1% year-over-year. First-party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our priority and are growing rapidly, increasing more than 30% year-over-year and driving cloud storage services to two-thirds of total Public Cloud ARR. These offerings are highly differentiated and closely aligned with customers' purchase preferences. In Q4, we had a good number of takeouts of competitors' on-premises infrastructure with cloud storage services based on NetApp ONTAP technology, which helped drive our best quarter for cloud storage services with each of our hyperscaler partners. We are well ahead of the competition in cloud storage services and we are innovating to further extend our leadership position. In Q4, we further increased the performance of Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, addressing an even broader set of performance intensive workloads. We also introduced a new service level for Google Cloud NetApp Volumes giving customers more granular control to match the capacity and performance needs of their cloud workloads. We were proud to receive Google Cloud's Technology Partner of the Year for Infrastructure, Storage for the second consecutive year. Reflecting on FY '24, I want to thank the NetApp team for their work to strengthen our position. We have a stronger, more complete all-flash portfolio are addressing a wider set of cloud storage workloads, and have a robust go-to-market plan, better positioning us to win across the board and in new markets like AI. Without question, our modern approach to unified data storage, spanning data types, price points, and hybrid multi-cloud environments is resonating in the market, giving us solid momentum as we enter the new fiscal year. Looking ahead to FY '25, we are cautiously optimistic on the macro environment. The backdrop is better now than it was at the start of FY '24. We will remain laser focused on our top priorities while continuing to raise the bar on execution and maintaining our operational discipline. NetApp is leading the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers make their data infrastructure intelligent for the age of AI. I am confident that this leadership, coupled with the strong momentum we've built through FY '24 positions us for continued growth and share gains. I encourage you to attend or tune into our June 11th Investor Day to learn more about our long term strategy. Visit our investor relations website for more information. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As George noted, we are laser focused on managing the elements within our control. This focus enabled us to deliver strong P&L performance for Q4 and the full year. Before getting into the details, let me quickly highlight the key themes. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. We delivered solid revenue growth in Q4, driven by our all-flash and cloud storage portfolio, which have strong momentum as we head into fiscal year '25. For Q4, our all-flash array revenue achieved a $3.6 billion annualized run rate, growing 17% year-on-year. Flash now accounts for approximately 60% of hybrid cloud revenue. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering delivered another strong quarter and a strong year, with revenue growth up triple-digits year-over-year in fiscal year '24. And first-party and marketplace cloud storage, the largest part of our cloud business grew double-digits quarter-over-quarter and over 30% year-over-year in Q4. Our operating profit margin was a record for a Q4 and operating cash flow was an all-time record. For the full year fiscal '24, product gross margins reached a record high of 60%, representing around 1,000 basis points of year-over-year improvement, driven by product mix, lower SSD costs and a normalizing supply chain environment. We have an increasing share of total revenue derived from higher margin and recurring revenue sources, which we expect to continue into fiscal '25. In fiscal '24, we generated $1.53 billion in free cash flow, a 76% year-over-year increase compared to fiscal year of '23, and an all-time high. And we returned 86% of fiscal '24 free cash flow to shareholders, through $900 million of share repurchases and around $400 million of dividends. Our share repurchases resulted in a reduction of full year diluted share count by approximately 3% from the prior year. We plan to continue a strong policy of shareholder returns in fiscal '25 and are announcing today an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.52. Furthermore, today, we are announcing an increase to our share repurchase authorization by another $1 billion. Now to the details of Q4. Revenue came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.67 billion, up 6% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Q4 billings of $1.81 billion were up 8% year-over-year. This marks our second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue and billings growth. Q4 Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.52 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Product revenue was $806 million and up 8% year-over-year. Support revenue of $623 million increased 4% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited the year at $630 million, up 2% year-over-year and up $22 million from Q3. Public Cloud revenue composed 9% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 1% year-over-year to $152 million. We exited fiscal '24 with $4.23 billion in deferred revenue, a decrease of 2% year-over-year, consistent with the year-over-year decrease in Q3. Q4 consolidated gross margin was approximately 71.5%. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 72%. Product gross margin was 61%, a 130 basis points ahead of our prior guidance, driven by better mix and continued growth in our C-series products. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin increased 290 basis points both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year to 68%. Q4 again highlighted the strength of our business model and our operational discipline with operating margin of 28%, the highest for a Q4 in the history of NetApp and the second only to last quarter's 30% operating margin. EPS of $1.80 was $0.02 ahead of guidance of $1.78, predominantly driven by better gross margins. As a reminder, we had a one-time improvement in our tax rate in Q3 that normalized towards our usual low 20% range in Q4, which was contemplated in our prior guidance. In Q4, cash flow from operations was $613 million and free cash flow was $567 million. These cash flow metrics came in above our expectations in Q4 due to higher customer collections, lower tax payments, and lower supply chain payments. During Q4, we repurchased $100 million in stock and paid out $104 million in dividends. Q4 diluted share count of 212 million was down 2% year-over-year. We had approximately $500 million left on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of fiscal '24, and today, we are announcing an increase in that authorization by another $1 billion. Before moving to guidance, let's review the results for the full year of fiscal '24. Revenue of $6.27 billion was down 1% year-over-year and billings of $6.25 billion were down 2% year-over-year. Disciplined operational management yielded all-time fiscal year highs for operating margin and EPS. For fiscal '24, operating margin was 27%, up 260 basis points year-over-year, driven predominantly by 450 basis points of year-over-year improvement in gross margins, slightly offset by the small year-over-year revenue decline and targeted operating expense growth. For fiscal '24, operating cash flow was $1.69 billion and free cash flow was $1.53 billion, both all-time company highs. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We closed the year with $3.25 billion in cash and short-term investments against $2.4 billion in total debt. Now to guidance, starting with fiscal '25. Let me underscore our confidence in our strategy and the strength of our position in addressing key customer priorities, such as business analytics, AI, cloud transitions, data security, and application modernization. Macro indicators today are better than a year ago. However, while there has been some improvement, in our view, the macro environment remains unsettled. As a result, we expect fiscal '25 total revenue to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.65 billion, which at the midpoint, reflects 4.5% year-over-year growth. Implied in our fiscal '25 revenue guidance is year-over-year revenue growth in each quarter of fiscal '25. While we are not providing specific Cloud revenue guidance, we do expect Public Cloud revenue to return to consistent growth in fiscal '25. We expect fiscal '25 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 71% to 72%, consistent with fiscal '24 gross margins despite the pressure coming from rising NAND component costs. We expect growth in support and cloud gross profit to help maintain our overall gross margins. Implied in this guidance is growth year-over-year in gross profit dollars, which is our focus. We have secured a large majority of our forecasted SSD demand for fiscal '25, albeit at higher prices than fiscal '24. Given our existing inventory levels and the forecasted use of our pre-buy supply, product gross margins are expected to be higher in the first half of fiscal '25, as we utilize our inventory, compared to the second half of fiscal '25. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin target of 75% to 80% and expect to make progress in fiscal '25 towards this target. We anticipate operating margins of 27% to 28% and EPS of $6.80 to $7. For the year, we expect a tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%. We expect operating cash flow will move in line with net income, although, there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital, especially in Q1, when we will pay our annual incentive compensation plans. Our anticipated healthy cash generation enables us to continue our strong return of capital to shareholders. In fiscal '25, we intend to return up to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in share buybacks and dividends. Our conviction in future cash flow generation is driving the increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share in fiscal '25, with the remainder of free cash flow going to share buybacks. We expect to reduce share count by approximately 1% to 2% in fiscal '25. Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 revenue to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies growth of 7% year-over-year. We expect Q1 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 72% and operating margin to be approximately 25%. EPS should be in the range between $1.40 and $1.50. In closing, I want to echo George's appreciation of the NetApp team and their continued focus and execution in this uncertain environment. As I look forward into fiscal '25, I am confident in our strategy and our ability to capture our growing set of opportunities and increase profitability. I'll now turn the call over to Kris for Q&A.\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you, guys for taking my question. Maybe, George, to start, you spent some time talking about the competitive successes that you had in the quarter and the strength of both the A-series and the C-series. Can you maybe expand upon that relative to sort of what you're seeing in the macro? I mean, there's a lot of discussion in the market, not just for storage, but in IT for general macro headwinds and it doesn't appear to be a big factor for you this quarter. And then with regards to Keystone, you talked about some displacements because of a whole host of factors with the offering. Can you maybe expand upon what were some of the more important factors? You mentioned performance. Was price a consideration, or is it really the suite of solutions, the suite of offerings that really drives sort of that Keystone success? And can you maybe talk about the average length of these agreements? Are these two to three year agreements? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you for the question. Listen, we are cautiously optimistic on the macro. As you noticed, it's better than we started the prior year, but there's still a good amount of uncertainty and caution in customer spending. They are prioritizing the applications like analytics, unifying their data for AI, modernizing their environment, and dealing with disruptions from changes like VMware. And we have had really good success across all of those landscapes. We've had strong wins across multiple elements of the AI opportunity from data lakes to model training to RAG on our customers' installed data. And we see that across multiple verticals. We've had strong success with our offerings displacing VxRail and other hyper converged platforms that customers look to optimize their VMware landscapes. And in the case of Keystone, which has had a really strong year, every quarter of the year has been strong and we had a really, really strong Q4. What we are seeing is customers like the idea of a unified, integrated data platform for all of their data and a cloud like experience. What we are able to offer uniquely in the market is the same experience in your data center, as in a co-location environment, as in all the leading public clouds. And so, the value of the flexibility that we offer, and the operational consistency and simplicity is what's allowing us to win all these deals. And they're not on price, these are long-term architectural commitments that customers are making. And they are multi-year agreements. I'll leave it there.\nDavid Vogt: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. George, regarding your outlook for growth for fiscal '25, 4.5% growth, which, as you say, reflects macro concerns, we are hearing another reason is that vendors focusing on AI investments, which are leading to push-outs of other projects, including both hardware and software. We heard from another -- a number of big companies just this week. Are you seeing signs of that as well in your business, or is that just -- are you just seeing continued cautiousness concerning all budgets?\nGeorge Kurian: I think more of the latter. There's just generally continued scrutiny of spending. I think with regard to our outlook, we are very confident entering the year. We finished really strong. Our Flash portfolio has even got stronger in Q1 with the refresh of our A-series Flash products. So we feel really good with a really up to date A-series CAM expanding ASA product, which had a really strong quarter. And, of course, the C-series, which has been setting records for performance in our business. So, we feel really good. I think on the AI side, listen, we are the installed incumbent for the world's largest unstructured data set, and we are helping customers unify those data sets, building data lakes. We saw that, for example, in one of the world's largest genomics companies, where together with NVIDIA, we built a supercomputing environment that allows them to accelerate drug discovery. And then, we talked about the success we had at one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, where we not only built their supercomputer for a trillion parameter large language model, but we are also the backbone for all of their RAG at their AI Center of Excellence. So I feel really good about our ability to tap into the AI opportunity, as well as continue the leadership we've shown in traditional enterprise applications.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe the first question, just on the first-party and marketplace cloud storage strength, is there any trends that you're seeing with the type of customer? Is that somebody who is an existing NetApp customer or those largely new customers? Just any trends of who are those customers where you're seeing that strength? And then, maybe just the second question for Mike. It would seem that Q1 is starting seasonally strong, at least in comparison with last year, which maybe was seasonally weak. Is some of that A-series launch -- just how to think about how A-series launch impacts the seasonality of the year? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: I'll take the first question, Meta. On the cloud storage side, the first-party and marketplace storage services, which are our focus, have had strong results throughout the year. In Q4, we continued to see a really good balance of new customers that are new to NetApp, including competitive displacement, bringing competitor footprints to cloud on our platform, as well as a mix of existing NetApp customers who were deploying and migrating workloads to the cloud, and expansions, where a customer might have not had a first-party service like in Google, now expanding on our first-party Google Cloud service. So good balance across the board sets us up to have a continued strong outlook for cloud storage this coming year. Mike?\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Thanks for the question, Meta. So yes, we do expect Q1 to be seasonally strong. As you mentioned, Q1 of last year was seasonally weak, so it is one of the easier compares, I'll say, for the year. In reference to the A-series launch, we're super excited about it. That is something that's just gotten started, though, so it won't have a big impact on Q1. We do expect that though, to start driving some nice trajectory as we move through fiscal '25.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, George, you talked about the support and sort of the infrastructure that you're providing your customers as they go through their AI deployments and the wins you have. I was just curious if you can give us a bit more sense about how to then translate that into revenue, particularly when I think about sort of fiscal '25 guide here, how much of that is incorporated in terms of those deployments in your revenue and how to think about that ramping in the out year. And a quick follow-up for Mike. Mike, if you can just help me with the puts and takes in terms of gross margin variance between Q3 and Q4, that will be helpful in terms of what the headwinds and tailwinds were. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, broadly speaking, we had about more than 50 AI wins in Q4 across all elements of the AI landscape I talked about, both in data foundations like data lakes as well as model training and inferencing across all of the geographies. I would tell you that in the AI market, the ramp on AI servers will be much ahead of storage because what clients our doing is they're building new computing stacks but using their existing data. And so we expect that over time there will be a lot more data created and unified to continue to feed the model. But at this stage, we are in proof of concept. We think that there's a strong opportunity over time for us and all of the AI growth is factored into our guidance for next year.\nMike Berry: And on your follow-up, Samik, on gross margins from Q3 to Q4, so as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we did come in about 130 basis points higher on product margins. We had guided around 60%. That was largely due to better mix. As we had talked about, we did expect that to come down from Q3 just because it was our Q4 and that's largely what happened. We support gross margin very consistent. And importantly, we started to see a nice increase in our cloud gross margins and we expect that to continue in the next year. So pretty consistent performance Q3 to Q4 in our gross margin line.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, when I look at your Q1 operating margin guide, I believe, in the context of fiscal year, it seems like you're going to exit FY '25 in the high 20% operating margin, 29% to be exact. Does that 29% operating margin exiting FY '25 include all the OpEx leverage given the resizing that you went through last year?\nMike Berry: Yeah. So we got it in full year, 27% to 28% operating margin. And yes, operating margin was always a little bit lower on a percentage in Q1 just given the seasonality. So I think what you're referring to, Mehdi, is we did do the restructuring last year in Q4. As we enter fiscal '25, we do have some leverage continuing in OpEx. We do expect OpEx to grow, I'm going to say, about 2% for the full year basis on a revenue guide of about 4.5%. We are doing targeted hiring in sales and in engineering to drive key product initiatives. Outside of that, as we've always said, our goal is to always drive operating leverage in the business and have OpEx grow at a rate less than OpEx -- than revenue growth, excuse me.\nMehdi Hosseini: But you did 30% operating margin in January at a lower revenue run rate. Why shouldn't we be able to meet or exceed 30% operating margin given your reduced footprint?\nGeorge Kurian: Yeah. So, the 30%, keep in mind, that was the highest that we saw in our gross margin numbers. And we have talked about many of those starting higher in fiscal '25 and then coming down as we go through the year as we go through the pre-buys that we have for SSD. So, it is significantly influenced by that gross margin number. We'd love to get back to the 30%. At this point, a lot of that depends on where the gross margin line goes.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi, Mike. Just to follow up on his points on pre-buys, can you just maybe further outline your strategy in terms of pre-buys? Would you continue to do that six months out, 12 months out, etc., or is it more depending on how you view the market? And along those lines, can you give us a better sense for sort of the gross margin headwinds as you get into the second half from the higher NAND costs? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Sure. So, as we talked about, we were very active in pre-buys for fiscal '24. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have locked in a large majority of our forecasted SSDs for '25, albeit at prices higher than '24, as you would expect, Steve. And really, when we look at that, we look at where the market is, we look at obviously our demand, and where we think the prices are going to go. The supply chain team has been very active in this market, and we think it's an important part of protecting our margins. At this point, we are still comfortable with the full year 58% to 60% range that we talked about in product gross margins for fiscal '25. The variables there are potential further increases or decreases in NAND costs through the rest of the year, and then, of course, storage market pricing plays into it. I do want to reiterate, hey, we are focused on driving the top-line growth and driving additional gross margin dollars and EPS while being disciplined in pricing. We certainly continue to look at product gross margin percentages, but at the end of the day, we will focus on driving profitable revenue growth and margin dollars. So again, 58% to 60% for the full year, starting higher in the first half, and then scaling down as we go through the year.\nSteven Fox: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thanks for taking the question. I did catch the comment that you expect public cloud services to grow through the year. I just want to see if we can maybe get a refresh on what's changing in that business that's getting us back to growth, and maybe if you could quantify what you mean in terms of your contributions with some more numbers, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yeah. Listen, a couple of quarters ago, we said that we were taking action to sharpen the focus of our public cloud business. Those are along two dimensions. The first was to continue to drive the execution of a growth strategy around our first-party and hyperscaler storage services. As we said, storage is now about two-thirds of the total cloud business, and first-party and marketplace cloud storage services are the preponderant majority of our cloud storage. And that has performed really, really well and is the foundation for long-term success and growth in cloud. Second, we said that the subscription business had headwinds related to cloud optimization, and we took several actions to improve the health of our subscription business. As a reminder, we said that subscription was about a fifth of the total cloud business, so a small part, and we took actions to both stop selling certain products and services that were no longer a part of our go-forward plan, to migrate some customers from our subscription offerings to our first-party cloud consumption offerings, to integrate some of the subscription products as being features of our cloud storage offerings, and to be able to sharpen the value proposition of our subscription offerings and work with our customer success team to improve the value to the client. What this has resulted in is a decrease in subscription revenue in the second half of this year, as we forecast, but the headwinds from that decrease are getting smaller and smaller, and over the course of the first half of next year, we feel that a large part of those headwinds will be mitigated. We expect that cloud first-party and marketplace cloud storage should continue to ramp strongly, which will deliver overall growth in cloud, consistent revenue growth in cloud in fiscal year '25, stronger in the second half than in the first half.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much for taking the question. I was wondering, Mike, did I hear correctly you say that the range of product growth margin could be between 50% to 60% starting at sort of the high end of that range and maybe closing out somewhere towards the lower end of that range? Could you clarify that?\nMike Berry: Yeah. So, Wamsi, so sorry if -- hopefully, I said it correctly. What we talked about is we're still comfortable with the 58% to 60% range in product growth margins for the full year, starting out higher in the first half and then sliding down as we go through the second half and use the inventory of pre-buys.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. I mean, historically when you looked at the swing in product gross margins given change in commodity pricing, you've had two impacts. First one is just sort of your ability to pass some of that through on your top-line. And secondarily, the swing on product gross margin has been a little bit larger. So, could you just maybe talk through maybe 400 basis points or 500 basis points, maybe historically, Mike, and correct me if I'm wrong there, but can you just talk through sort of what is the upside on revenue that you're thinking could come from pass-through of the increased NAND cost in the second half and why is it not quite as wide this time around when presumably you've done pre-buys in the past too? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I'll take that question in two parts, one on the revenue side and the second on the gross margin side. On the revenue side, we continue to believe that customers budget in dollars, not in systems. And so, while we expect that the industry will follow the normal course of behavior, which is to raise prices to customers as commodity prices go up, we don't expect that to translate into directly increasing revenue. Customers will buy smaller amounts of storage if they have to pay more for it, but they will spend the dollars budgeted for it, and that's what's reflected in our top-line. With regard to cost of goods sold, I think, first of all, as Mike said, we have completed a large percentage of our forecasted demand for NAND through the course of next year, and as we have said before, NAND is less than 50% of our total cost of goods, the rest of which is flat. The outlook we are providing is based on our current -- is based on current market pricing. If the overall market raises prices as we have done in the past, we expect to follow the market, and that should be accreted to the outlook that we have provided.\nMike Berry: And if I could just add one thing, Wamsi, and you asked about the volatility of the margins, keep in mind that in fiscal '23 we had to deal with the premium issue, that then went away. So that's caused a lot of it. Fiscal '24 was really 55% to 61%, so just keep that in mind as you look at fiscal '23, please.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. Two also, if I could. First, [Technical Difficulty] Can you hear me?\nKris Newton: No, you are off with static. I think you might need to dial back into the queue. All right. Next question, please.\nOperator: Tim, if you can hear us, we'll move on, but you can dial back into the queue at any time. The next question is from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: Yeah. Thank you. Given the discussion around the driver of the 10% Q-on-Q increase in first-party marketplace cloud storage, it sounds like this is a sustainable driver. So, is it fair to expect that the public, the cloud storage, and first-party marketplace year-over-year growth will accelerate as we go through fiscal year '25 here?\nGeorge Kurian: We expect public cloud storage, particularly first-party and marketplace, which are the focus of our cloud efforts to continue to grow nicely through the course of the year. I'm not going to comment about sequential growth rate each quarter. We had a really nice quarter this quarter, and we had a good year all year. I think that we see that first-party and cloud storage and marketplace is a much bigger part of our overall cloud business entering fiscal year '25 than it was entering fiscal year '24. And the rest of the offerings, as I said, we continue to sharpen the focus and be more targeted in terms of our subscription offerings. They will have a little bit more headwinds in the first half of the year, but we expect cloud to grow consistently in FY '25, stronger in the second half than in the first.\nNehal Chokshi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTim Long: Thank you. I'll try it again with a different headset. Sorry about that. Just wanted to touch on the QLC C-series business. It seems like there's been some competitors trying to get into that piece of the market as well. So, two-parter. Number one, what do you think the increased competition would mean for that business, for NetApp? And then secondly, if you could just remind us, that business has been very successful for you. Can you talk a little bit about how that business has been going, meaning, has this been a lot of success with new customers or keeping your own base that's upgrading from hybrid systems? Any help there would be great. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yeah. Thanks for the question. With regard to upgrading an existing hybrid flash customer to our C-series, there are enormous advantages for a customer of NetApp to stay in place because we have the same operating system, the same management console, the same telemetry system, and we can do that virtually seamlessly for customers. And so, we've seen a good chunk of upgrades from 10K drive environments to our all-flash, and we expect that to continue over time. Those will come up as customers upgrade their fleet in a periodic and steady fashion. We also saw a lot of new to NetApp environments in our customers where we were able to either displace competitive footprints and/or bring new footprints to NetApp as customers deployed new applications. We talked about the example with Keystone in a large customer that was considering two different approaches, one for file and one for block, and decided to unify on NetApp. We have seen several environments where hyper-converged VMware landscapes are now moving to optimize the cost of their VMware licenses and are using C-series. And over time, we just introduced the C-series AI part that gives clients a cost-effective capacity flash-based AI model training and inferencing environment. So, we're excited about the prospects with C-series. Listen, everybody will have their alternatives in the market. We feel really good about the fact that we have the industry's most comprehensive data management, the only real hybrid cloud solution, and a track record of having really large-scale data management capabilities on our flash products. And we feel very, very confident getting into next year.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon. George, maybe just actually picking up right there, is there a useful way to think about which of these kind of opportunities you've been stepping into are sort of the most accretive through the fiscal year? And I believe you were talking, I think, like the last few quarters, I'm saying few loosely, it's kind of been ASA San opportunity and the 10K Drive opportunity. Is there any way to, I don't know, like sort of anecdotally, not force RAG, but give us context about around which opportunities are going to be the biggest catalyst as you go through the year? Thanks a lot.\nGeorge Kurian: We have four growth opportunities that we are focused on, all-flash storage, block storage, cloud storage, and AI. And let me get each of those in turn. In all-flash storage, we have seen strong success with high-performance flash replacing legacy frame array and sort of traditional mainframe class storage with much more modern high-performance landscapes. We have seen the C-series both replace hyperconverged as well as traditional hybrid flash architectures, upgrading both our install base and competitor install bases. With the ASA platform, which is block, the second part of the growth opportunity, that is TAM-expanding for NetApp. And we are excited at the wins that we've seen and the momentum that we have. It will be a smaller business this coming year relative to the C-series and the AFF A-series, but it will be all TAM-expanding for NetApp. And I'm excited at where we are today. With cloud storage, listen, the cloud market is an enormous market. It's a multi-billion-dollar opportunity, and our cloud storage is a part of that opportunity. As the cloud providers have seen a reacceleration in their business, we are well positioned to grow our business and our focus is to grow it at a rate higher than the infrastructure-as-a-service growth rates of the big hyper-scalers. And then finally, AI, this is the opportunity that will become much more meaningful over time. We are well positioned with the huge installed base of unstructured data, which is the fuel for GenAI, and we are focused on helping customers do in-place RAG and inferencing of that data. Second, our unified data storage systems with integrated data services provide an ideal foundation for customers looking to build a data lake or model training landscapes. And then our hybrid cloud architecture gives us a unique place in the environment, allowing customers to use public cloud AI platforms such as Vertex from Google or Bedrock from AWS with their on-premises data and be able to scale inferencing to where every piece of customers' data and IT landscape exists. So, those are the four. We're excited about the year ahead. We will tell you more about the specific puts and takes of each opportunity at our Financial Analyst Day on June 11th.\nAnanda Baruah: Yeah. That's great, George. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nEddie Pellon: Hey, guys. This is Eddie for Krish. When it comes to RAG applications, have you seen any increase in storage density per unit requirements? And I wonder, Kurian, if you can update us on your efforts of adopting 10 terabyte SSDs in your systems? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think with the -- I didn't hear the question entirely clearly, but what we see with RAG is customers wanting to use a large amount of unstructured data alongside a model that has already been trained to get it even more aware of the context in which its operating. Our CCVs and ACVs are both well suited for that. For customers that want really large landscapes, we are really excited about the opportunity with the C-series where we already have 30 terabyte drives that are adding higher density drives as customers need. And then for large-scale data lakes, we are able to build highly dense object storage or mixed object and file storage landscapes that we have done for many, many clients over the last quarter.\nEddie Pellon: Okay. Yeah. My question, George -- thank you. And my question was about 10 terabyte SSDs. So, it seems like that's already shipping in your systems as of today. Is that right?\nMike Berry: We have 30 terabyte SSDs and they are growing quickly as a percentage of the total capacity. The way our systems are built, we can pass a lot more density into a single system than many of our competitors.\nEddie Pellon: Got it. Thank you, George.\nGeorge Kurian: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Today's last question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thanks. Apologize if this question has been asked, but maybe if I can just focus on the free cash flow for next year. I don't know if this is a guide that was provided for that and how you can think about how we should think about that and the shareholder returns for the fiscal year.\nMike Berry: Sure. Thanks for asking the cash flow question. So, hey, we'll have a couple more minutes. As I talked about on the -- in the prepared remarks, we expect cash flow to continue to track with net income. So, if you take the midpoint of the guide, that says that net income does go up year-over-year. A couple of things. So, we would expect cash flow to move with it. During the year, there'll be some working capital changes and I just want to make sure I highlight these. Keep in mind that in Q1, we will pay our annual incentive compensation payments and incrementally year-over-year, thankfully, it's a relatively large number, it's about $150 million. We expect then collections to increase year-over-year. And then as long as we continue to purchase -- do pre-buys, we expect that to even out over the year as well. So all of that said, we would expect cash flow to -- operating cash flow to continue to track with net income. And from a CapEx perspective, we did about $155 million in fiscal '24. You should expect something relatively consistent with that in fiscal '25. And then that caps it off of capital allocation. We did increase the dividend from $0.50 a share to $0.52 a share. So, that will use call it $425 million of cash about for the year. The remainder of free cash flow is slated to go against share repurchases.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thank you. I'll now pass it over to George for some final comments.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. We ended FY '24 strong with robust performance in Q4 and building positive momentum entering FY '25. Capacity flash, block storage, cloud storage services, and AI all represent enormous growth opportunities for us. We are performing well and expect continued growth in these areas. NetApp is leading the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers make their data infrastructure intelligent for the age of AI. We are capitalizing on our share gain opportunity and will maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. Thank you for your time today, and I hope to see you at our June 11th Investor Day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As George noted, we are laser focused on managing the elements within our control. This focus enabled us to deliver strong P&L performance for Q4 and the full year. Before getting into the details, let me quickly highlight the key themes. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. We delivered solid revenue growth in Q4, driven by our all-flash and cloud storage portfolio, which have strong momentum as we head into fiscal year '25. For Q4, our all-flash array revenue achieved a $3.6 billion annualized run rate, growing 17% year-on-year. Flash now accounts for approximately 60% of hybrid cloud revenue. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering delivered another strong quarter and a strong year, with revenue growth up triple-digits year-over-year in fiscal year '24. And first-party and marketplace cloud storage, the largest part of our cloud business grew double-digits quarter-over-quarter and over 30% year-over-year in Q4. Our operating profit margin was a record for a Q4 and operating cash flow was an all-time record. For the full year fiscal '24, product gross margins reached a record high of 60%, representing around 1,000 basis points of year-over-year improvement, driven by product mix, lower SSD costs and a normalizing supply chain environment. We have an increasing share of total revenue derived from higher margin and recurring revenue sources, which we expect to continue into fiscal '25. In fiscal '24, we generated $1.53 billion in free cash flow, a 76% year-over-year increase compared to fiscal year of '23, and an all-time high. And we returned 86% of fiscal '24 free cash flow to shareholders, through $900 million of share repurchases and around $400 million of dividends. Our share repurchases resulted in a reduction of full year diluted share count by approximately 3% from the prior year. We plan to continue a strong policy of shareholder returns in fiscal '25 and are announcing today an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.52. Furthermore, today, we are announcing an increase to our share repurchase authorization by another $1 billion. Now to the details of Q4. Revenue came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.67 billion, up 6% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Q4 billings of $1.81 billion were up 8% year-over-year. This marks our second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue and billings growth. Q4 Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.52 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Product revenue was $806 million and up 8% year-over-year. Support revenue of $623 million increased 4% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited the year at $630 million, up 2% year-over-year and up $22 million from Q3. Public Cloud revenue composed 9% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 1% year-over-year to $152 million. We exited fiscal '24 with $4.23 billion in deferred revenue, a decrease of 2% year-over-year, consistent with the year-over-year decrease in Q3. Q4 consolidated gross margin was approximately 71.5%. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 72%. Product gross margin was 61%, a 130 basis points ahead of our prior guidance, driven by better mix and continued growth in our C-series products. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin increased 290 basis points both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year to 68%. Q4 again highlighted the strength of our business model and our operational discipline with operating margin of 28%, the highest for a Q4 in the history of NetApp and the second only to last quarter's 30% operating margin. EPS of $1.80 was $0.02 ahead of guidance of $1.78, predominantly driven by better gross margins. As a reminder, we had a one-time improvement in our tax rate in Q3 that normalized towards our usual low 20% range in Q4, which was contemplated in our prior guidance. In Q4, cash flow from operations was $613 million and free cash flow was $567 million. These cash flow metrics came in above our expectations in Q4 due to higher customer collections, lower tax payments, and lower supply chain payments. During Q4, we repurchased $100 million in stock and paid out $104 million in dividends. Q4 diluted share count of 212 million was down 2% year-over-year. We had approximately $500 million left on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of fiscal '24, and today, we are announcing an increase in that authorization by another $1 billion. Before moving to guidance, let's review the results for the full year of fiscal '24. Revenue of $6.27 billion was down 1% year-over-year and billings of $6.25 billion were down 2% year-over-year. Disciplined operational management yielded all-time fiscal year highs for operating margin and EPS. For fiscal '24, operating margin was 27%, up 260 basis points year-over-year, driven predominantly by 450 basis points of year-over-year improvement in gross margins, slightly offset by the small year-over-year revenue decline and targeted operating expense growth. For fiscal '24, operating cash flow was $1.69 billion and free cash flow was $1.53 billion, both all-time company highs. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We closed the year with $3.25 billion in cash and short-term investments against $2.4 billion in total debt. Now to guidance, starting with fiscal '25. Let me underscore our confidence in our strategy and the strength of our position in addressing key customer priorities, such as business analytics, AI, cloud transitions, data security, and application modernization. Macro indicators today are better than a year ago. However, while there has been some improvement, in our view, the macro environment remains unsettled. As a result, we expect fiscal '25 total revenue to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.65 billion, which at the midpoint, reflects 4.5% year-over-year growth. Implied in our fiscal '25 revenue guidance is year-over-year revenue growth in each quarter of fiscal '25. While we are not providing specific Cloud revenue guidance, we do expect Public Cloud revenue to return to consistent growth in fiscal '25. We expect fiscal '25 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 71% to 72%, consistent with fiscal '24 gross margins despite the pressure coming from rising NAND component costs. We expect growth in support and cloud gross profit to help maintain our overall gross margins. Implied in this guidance is growth year-over-year in gross profit dollars, which is our focus. We have secured a large majority of our forecasted SSD demand for fiscal '25, albeit at higher prices than fiscal '24. Given our existing inventory levels and the forecasted use of our pre-buy supply, product gross margins are expected to be higher in the first half of fiscal '25, as we utilize our inventory, compared to the second half of fiscal '25. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin target of 75% to 80% and expect to make progress in fiscal '25 towards this target. We anticipate operating margins of 27% to 28% and EPS of $6.80 to $7. For the year, we expect a tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%. We expect operating cash flow will move in line with net income, although, there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital, especially in Q1, when we will pay our annual incentive compensation plans. Our anticipated healthy cash generation enables us to continue our strong return of capital to shareholders. In fiscal '25, we intend to return up to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in share buybacks and dividends. Our conviction in future cash flow generation is driving the increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share in fiscal '25, with the remainder of free cash flow going to share buybacks. We expect to reduce share count by approximately 1% to 2% in fiscal '25. Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 revenue to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies growth of 7% year-over-year. We expect Q1 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 72% and operating margin to be approximately 25%. EPS should be in the range between $1.40 and $1.50. In closing, I want to echo George's appreciation of the NetApp team and their continued focus and execution in this uncertain environment. As I look forward into fiscal '25, I am confident in our strategy and our ability to capture our growing set of opportunities and increase profitability. I'll now turn the call over to Kris for Q&A. Thank you, George. Thanks for the question, Meta. So yes, we do expect Q1 to be seasonally strong. As you mentioned, Q1 of last year was seasonally weak, so it is one of the easier compares, I'll say, for the year. In reference to the A-series launch, we're super excited about it. That is something that's just gotten started, though, so it won't have a big impact on Q1. We do expect that though, to start driving some nice trajectory as we move through fiscal '25. And on your follow-up, Samik, on gross margins from Q3 to Q4, so as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we did come in about 130 basis points higher on product margins. We had guided around 60%. That was largely due to better mix. As we had talked about, we did expect that to come down from Q3 just because it was our Q4 and that's largely what happened. We support gross margin very consistent. And importantly, we started to see a nice increase in our cloud gross margins and we expect that to continue in the next year. So pretty consistent performance Q3 to Q4 in our gross margin line. Yeah. So we got it in full year, 27% to 28% operating margin. And yes, operating margin was always a little bit lower on a percentage in Q1 just given the seasonality. So I think what you're referring to, Mehdi, is we did do the restructuring last year in Q4. As we enter fiscal '25, we do have some leverage continuing in OpEx. We do expect OpEx to grow, I'm going to say, about 2% for the full year basis on a revenue guide of about 4.5%. We are doing targeted hiring in sales and in engineering to drive key product initiatives. Outside of that, as we've always said, our goal is to always drive operating leverage in the business and have OpEx grow at a rate less than OpEx -- than revenue growth, excuse me. Sure. So, as we talked about, we were very active in pre-buys for fiscal '24. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have locked in a large majority of our forecasted SSDs for '25, albeit at prices higher than '24, as you would expect, Steve. And really, when we look at that, we look at where the market is, we look at obviously our demand, and where we think the prices are going to go. The supply chain team has been very active in this market, and we think it's an important part of protecting our margins. At this point, we are still comfortable with the full year 58% to 60% range that we talked about in product gross margins for fiscal '25. The variables there are potential further increases or decreases in NAND costs through the rest of the year, and then, of course, storage market pricing plays into it. I do want to reiterate, hey, we are focused on driving the top-line growth and driving additional gross margin dollars and EPS while being disciplined in pricing. We certainly continue to look at product gross margin percentages, but at the end of the day, we will focus on driving profitable revenue growth and margin dollars. So again, 58% to 60% for the full year, starting higher in the first half, and then scaling down as we go through the year. Yeah. So, Wamsi, so sorry if -- hopefully, I said it correctly. What we talked about is we're still comfortable with the 58% to 60% range in product growth margins for the full year, starting out higher in the first half and then sliding down as we go through the second half and use the inventory of pre-buys. And if I could just add one thing, Wamsi, and you asked about the volatility of the margins, keep in mind that in fiscal '23 we had to deal with the premium issue, that then went away. So that's caused a lot of it. Fiscal '24 was really 55% to 61%, so just keep that in mind as you look at fiscal '23, please. We have 30 terabyte SSDs and they are growing quickly as a percentage of the total capacity. The way our systems are built, we can pass a lot more density into a single system than many of our competitors. Sure. Thanks for asking the cash flow question. So, hey, we'll have a couple more minutes. As I talked about on the -- in the prepared remarks, we expect cash flow to continue to track with net income. So, if you take the midpoint of the guide, that says that net income does go up year-over-year. A couple of things. So, we would expect cash flow to move with it. During the year, there'll be some working capital changes and I just want to make sure I highlight these. Keep in mind that in Q1, we will pay our annual incentive compensation payments and incrementally year-over-year, thankfully, it's a relatively large number, it's about $150 million. We expect then collections to increase year-over-year. And then as long as we continue to purchase -- do pre-buys, we expect that to even out over the year as well. So all of that said, we would expect cash flow to -- operating cash flow to continue to track with net income. And from a CapEx perspective, we did about $155 million in fiscal '24. You should expect something relatively consistent with that in fiscal '25. And then that caps it off of capital allocation. We did increase the dividend from $0.50 a share to $0.52 a share. So, that will use call it $425 million of cash about for the year. The remainder of free cash flow is slated to go against share repurchases."

            "content": "Thank you, Kris. Welcome, everyone. We concluded FY '24 on a high note, demonstrating robust performance in the fourth quarter and building positive momentum as we step into FY '25. Our revenue for both Q4 and FY '24 exceeded the midpoint of our guidance, reflecting the strong growth of our expanded all-flash portfolio. Throughout FY '24, we maintained a high level of operational discipline, leading to company records for annual gross margin, operating margin, earnings per share, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. At the start of FY '24, we implemented a plan to enhance the performance of our storage business and build a more focused approach to the Public Cloud business, while managing the elements within our control in an uncertain macro environment. This plan has yielded tangible results, and our value proposition is resonating strongly in the marketplace. Customers are increasingly turning to NetApp to help them build intelligent data infrastructures and leverage the power of public and hybrid clouds for rapidly growing, data-intensive workloads like AI, cloud-native, open-source, and enterprise applications, while ensuring their data remains secure and protected from ransomware attacks. NetApp uniquely delivers a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, supporting any application, any data type, and spanning on-premises and multiple cloud environments. We deliver unparalleled simplicity of data management, and infrastructure and application deployment with consistent automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. In a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth, and escalating cybersecurity threats, we empower customers with the flexibility to rapidly deploy new applications, unify their data for AI, simplify cloud integration, and strengthen data protection. Now to the results of the quarter. We delivered robust year-over-year performance in our Hybrid Cloud segment, with revenue growth of 6% and product revenue growth of 8%. Strong customer demand for our broad portfolio of modern all-flash arrays, particularly the C-series capacity flash and ASA block optimized flash, was again ahead of our expectations. This demand propelled our all-flash array annualized revenue run rate to an all-time high at $3.6 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Early in Q1 of FY '25, we unveiled our new all-flash A series unified data storage products, offering customers enhanced performance and effective density at a lower cost than the previous A series generation. These products set a new standard for enterprise storage, enabling customers to turbocharge workloads ranging from traditional enterprise applications to GenAI. The new AFF A-series, coupled with our highly successful C-series and TAM expanding ASA product, position us to further increase our share in the all-flash market. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering was also a highlight of the quarter. Keystone provides cloud like management for hybrid cloud resources in a single subscription with flexible multiyear contracts that align storage costs with business needs, enabling rapid response to changing capacity and performance requirements. We consistently hear from customers that our integrated service level assurance, with performance, availability, ransomware recovery, and sustainability guarantees, is our differentiator. This has enabled us to accelerate growth by displacing competitors' storage-as-a-service subscriptions, winning new Keystone subscriptions, and expanding existing ones. FY '24 total contract value sales of Keystone more than doubled from the prior year to almost $150 million. We expect this momentum to continue and that FY '25 will be another significant growth year for Keystone. A leading semiconductor manufacturer selected Keystone as the vehicle to consolidate its storage needs. Initially aiming to select one vendor for block and another for file, we established ourselves as their single global standard for both environments, displacing the incumbent for block storage. This multi-year eight-figure deal allowed the customer to reduce the complexity and improve the availability of their storage environment. AI is a top priority for organizations as they seek to accelerate innovation, revolutionize operations, drive competitive advantage, and deliver superior solutions to their customers. Data management is essential for enterprise AI. Customers choose NetApp to support them at every phase of the AI lifecycle due to our high performance all-flash storage complemented by comprehensive data management capabilities that support requirements from data preparation, model training and tuning, retrieval-augmented generation or RAG, and inferencing, as well as requirements for responsible AI including model and data versioning, data governance and privacy. We continue to strengthen our position in enterprise AI, focusing on making it easier for customers to derive value from their AI investments. In Q4, we introduced NetApp AIPod with C-series capacity flash systems, delivering a new level of cost and performance, rack space utilization, and sustainability. In conjunction with Cisco, we updated FlexPod AI reference architectures to support the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, giving customers an end-to-end blueprint to efficiently design, deploy, and operate AI infrastructure. We were one of the first partners to complete the storage validation for NVIDIA OVX systems and at the start of Q1, we were the first to announce a full-stack OVX system. The NetApp AIPod with Lenovo ThinkSystem servers for NVIDIA OVX is optimized for GenAI and designed to support RAG. We announced much of this innovation at NVIDIA GTC, where we were honored to be recognized during the Keynote for our role in storing a significant portion of enterprises' unstructured data, which is the fuel for GenAI. Through our partnership with NVIDIA, we give customers the ability to talk directly to the large amount of existing data stored on NetApp on-premises and in the cloud, demonstrating the value of our installed base and this critical role we play in AI. We are the AI infrastructure of choice for one of the world's leading oil and gas companies. The company is developing its own large language model, using a high performance AI cluster with NetApp all-flash storage. They are now also building an AI Center of Excellence to support various departmental AI initiatives and have again selected NetApp storage for this part of their AI infrastructure, leveraging C-series to optimize price and performance. They are rapidly ramping up their AI infrastructure, building new models, and onboarding AI resources. They awarded us the deal over their AI server vendor because of our ability to remove to remove roadblocks in their AI workflows and accelerate the time to value from their AI investments. Public Cloud segment revenue was $152 million, up 1% year-over-year. First-party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our priority and are growing rapidly, increasing more than 30% year-over-year and driving cloud storage services to two-thirds of total Public Cloud ARR. These offerings are highly differentiated and closely aligned with customers' purchase preferences. In Q4, we had a good number of takeouts of competitors' on-premises infrastructure with cloud storage services based on NetApp ONTAP technology, which helped drive our best quarter for cloud storage services with each of our hyperscaler partners. We are well ahead of the competition in cloud storage services and we are innovating to further extend our leadership position. In Q4, we further increased the performance of Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, addressing an even broader set of performance intensive workloads. We also introduced a new service level for Google Cloud NetApp Volumes giving customers more granular control to match the capacity and performance needs of their cloud workloads. We were proud to receive Google Cloud's Technology Partner of the Year for Infrastructure, Storage for the second consecutive year. Reflecting on FY '24, I want to thank the NetApp team for their work to strengthen our position. We have a stronger, more complete all-flash portfolio are addressing a wider set of cloud storage workloads, and have a robust go-to-market plan, better positioning us to win across the board and in new markets like AI. Without question, our modern approach to unified data storage, spanning data types, price points, and hybrid multi-cloud environments is resonating in the market, giving us solid momentum as we enter the new fiscal year. Looking ahead to FY '25, we are cautiously optimistic on the macro environment. The backdrop is better now than it was at the start of FY '24. We will remain laser focused on our top priorities while continuing to raise the bar on execution and maintaining our operational discipline. NetApp is leading the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers make their data infrastructure intelligent for the age of AI. I am confident that this leadership, coupled with the strong momentum we've built through FY '24 positions us for continued growth and share gains. I encourage you to attend or tune into our June 11th Investor Day to learn more about our long term strategy. Visit our investor relations website for more information. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Thank you for the question. Listen, we are cautiously optimistic on the macro. As you noticed, it's better than we started the prior year, but there's still a good amount of uncertainty and caution in customer spending. They are prioritizing the applications like analytics, unifying their data for AI, modernizing their environment, and dealing with disruptions from changes like VMware. And we have had really good success across all of those landscapes. We've had strong wins across multiple elements of the AI opportunity from data lakes to model training to RAG on our customers' installed data. And we see that across multiple verticals. We've had strong success with our offerings displacing VxRail and other hyper converged platforms that customers look to optimize their VMware landscapes. And in the case of Keystone, which has had a really strong year, every quarter of the year has been strong and we had a really, really strong Q4. What we are seeing is customers like the idea of a unified, integrated data platform for all of their data and a cloud like experience. What we are able to offer uniquely in the market is the same experience in your data center, as in a co-location environment, as in all the leading public clouds. And so, the value of the flexibility that we offer, and the operational consistency and simplicity is what's allowing us to win all these deals. And they're not on price, these are long-term architectural commitments that customers are making. And they are multi-year agreements. I'll leave it there. I think more of the latter. There's just generally continued scrutiny of spending. I think with regard to our outlook, we are very confident entering the year. We finished really strong. Our Flash portfolio has even got stronger in Q1 with the refresh of our A-series Flash products. So we feel really good with a really up to date A-series CAM expanding ASA product, which had a really strong quarter. And, of course, the C-series, which has been setting records for performance in our business. So, we feel really good. I think on the AI side, listen, we are the installed incumbent for the world's largest unstructured data set, and we are helping customers unify those data sets, building data lakes. We saw that, for example, in one of the world's largest genomics companies, where together with NVIDIA, we built a supercomputing environment that allows them to accelerate drug discovery. And then, we talked about the success we had at one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, where we not only built their supercomputer for a trillion parameter large language model, but we are also the backbone for all of their RAG at their AI Center of Excellence. So I feel really good about our ability to tap into the AI opportunity, as well as continue the leadership we've shown in traditional enterprise applications. I'll take the first question, Meta. On the cloud storage side, the first-party and marketplace storage services, which are our focus, have had strong results throughout the year. In Q4, we continued to see a really good balance of new customers that are new to NetApp, including competitive displacement, bringing competitor footprints to cloud on our platform, as well as a mix of existing NetApp customers who were deploying and migrating workloads to the cloud, and expansions, where a customer might have not had a first-party service like in Google, now expanding on our first-party Google Cloud service. So good balance across the board sets us up to have a continued strong outlook for cloud storage this coming year. Mike? Thank you. Listen, broadly speaking, we had about more than 50 AI wins in Q4 across all elements of the AI landscape I talked about, both in data foundations like data lakes as well as model training and inferencing across all of the geographies. I would tell you that in the AI market, the ramp on AI servers will be much ahead of storage because what clients our doing is they're building new computing stacks but using their existing data. And so we expect that over time there will be a lot more data created and unified to continue to feed the model. But at this stage, we are in proof of concept. We think that there's a strong opportunity over time for us and all of the AI growth is factored into our guidance for next year. Yeah. So, the 30%, keep in mind, that was the highest that we saw in our gross margin numbers. And we have talked about many of those starting higher in fiscal '25 and then coming down as we go through the year as we go through the pre-buys that we have for SSD. So, it is significantly influenced by that gross margin number. We'd love to get back to the 30%. At this point, a lot of that depends on where the gross margin line goes. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Listen, a couple of quarters ago, we said that we were taking action to sharpen the focus of our public cloud business. Those are along two dimensions. The first was to continue to drive the execution of a growth strategy around our first-party and hyperscaler storage services. As we said, storage is now about two-thirds of the total cloud business, and first-party and marketplace cloud storage services are the preponderant majority of our cloud storage. And that has performed really, really well and is the foundation for long-term success and growth in cloud. Second, we said that the subscription business had headwinds related to cloud optimization, and we took several actions to improve the health of our subscription business. As a reminder, we said that subscription was about a fifth of the total cloud business, so a small part, and we took actions to both stop selling certain products and services that were no longer a part of our go-forward plan, to migrate some customers from our subscription offerings to our first-party cloud consumption offerings, to integrate some of the subscription products as being features of our cloud storage offerings, and to be able to sharpen the value proposition of our subscription offerings and work with our customer success team to improve the value to the client. What this has resulted in is a decrease in subscription revenue in the second half of this year, as we forecast, but the headwinds from that decrease are getting smaller and smaller, and over the course of the first half of next year, we feel that a large part of those headwinds will be mitigated. We expect that cloud first-party and marketplace cloud storage should continue to ramp strongly, which will deliver overall growth in cloud, consistent revenue growth in cloud in fiscal year '25, stronger in the second half than in the first half. Listen, I'll take that question in two parts, one on the revenue side and the second on the gross margin side. On the revenue side, we continue to believe that customers budget in dollars, not in systems. And so, while we expect that the industry will follow the normal course of behavior, which is to raise prices to customers as commodity prices go up, we don't expect that to translate into directly increasing revenue. Customers will buy smaller amounts of storage if they have to pay more for it, but they will spend the dollars budgeted for it, and that's what's reflected in our top-line. With regard to cost of goods sold, I think, first of all, as Mike said, we have completed a large percentage of our forecasted demand for NAND through the course of next year, and as we have said before, NAND is less than 50% of our total cost of goods, the rest of which is flat. The outlook we are providing is based on our current -- is based on current market pricing. If the overall market raises prices as we have done in the past, we expect to follow the market, and that should be accreted to the outlook that we have provided. We expect public cloud storage, particularly first-party and marketplace, which are the focus of our cloud efforts to continue to grow nicely through the course of the year. I'm not going to comment about sequential growth rate each quarter. We had a really nice quarter this quarter, and we had a good year all year. I think that we see that first-party and cloud storage and marketplace is a much bigger part of our overall cloud business entering fiscal year '25 than it was entering fiscal year '24. And the rest of the offerings, as I said, we continue to sharpen the focus and be more targeted in terms of our subscription offerings. They will have a little bit more headwinds in the first half of the year, but we expect cloud to grow consistently in FY '25, stronger in the second half than in the first. Yeah. Thanks for the question. With regard to upgrading an existing hybrid flash customer to our C-series, there are enormous advantages for a customer of NetApp to stay in place because we have the same operating system, the same management console, the same telemetry system, and we can do that virtually seamlessly for customers. And so, we've seen a good chunk of upgrades from 10K drive environments to our all-flash, and we expect that to continue over time. Those will come up as customers upgrade their fleet in a periodic and steady fashion. We also saw a lot of new to NetApp environments in our customers where we were able to either displace competitive footprints and/or bring new footprints to NetApp as customers deployed new applications. We talked about the example with Keystone in a large customer that was considering two different approaches, one for file and one for block, and decided to unify on NetApp. We have seen several environments where hyper-converged VMware landscapes are now moving to optimize the cost of their VMware licenses and are using C-series. And over time, we just introduced the C-series AI part that gives clients a cost-effective capacity flash-based AI model training and inferencing environment. So, we're excited about the prospects with C-series. Listen, everybody will have their alternatives in the market. We feel really good about the fact that we have the industry's most comprehensive data management, the only real hybrid cloud solution, and a track record of having really large-scale data management capabilities on our flash products. And we feel very, very confident getting into next year. We have four growth opportunities that we are focused on, all-flash storage, block storage, cloud storage, and AI. And let me get each of those in turn. In all-flash storage, we have seen strong success with high-performance flash replacing legacy frame array and sort of traditional mainframe class storage with much more modern high-performance landscapes. We have seen the C-series both replace hyperconverged as well as traditional hybrid flash architectures, upgrading both our install base and competitor install bases. With the ASA platform, which is block, the second part of the growth opportunity, that is TAM-expanding for NetApp. And we are excited at the wins that we've seen and the momentum that we have. It will be a smaller business this coming year relative to the C-series and the AFF A-series, but it will be all TAM-expanding for NetApp. And I'm excited at where we are today. With cloud storage, listen, the cloud market is an enormous market. It's a multi-billion-dollar opportunity, and our cloud storage is a part of that opportunity. As the cloud providers have seen a reacceleration in their business, we are well positioned to grow our business and our focus is to grow it at a rate higher than the infrastructure-as-a-service growth rates of the big hyper-scalers. And then finally, AI, this is the opportunity that will become much more meaningful over time. We are well positioned with the huge installed base of unstructured data, which is the fuel for GenAI, and we are focused on helping customers do in-place RAG and inferencing of that data. Second, our unified data storage systems with integrated data services provide an ideal foundation for customers looking to build a data lake or model training landscapes. And then our hybrid cloud architecture gives us a unique place in the environment, allowing customers to use public cloud AI platforms such as Vertex from Google or Bedrock from AWS with their on-premises data and be able to scale inferencing to where every piece of customers' data and IT landscape exists. So, those are the four. We're excited about the year ahead. We will tell you more about the specific puts and takes of each opportunity at our Financial Analyst Day on June 11th. Listen, I think with the -- I didn't hear the question entirely clearly, but what we see with RAG is customers wanting to use a large amount of unstructured data alongside a model that has already been trained to get it even more aware of the context in which its operating. Our CCVs and ACVs are both well suited for that. For customers that want really large landscapes, we are really excited about the opportunity with the C-series where we already have 30 terabyte drives that are adding higher density drives as customers need. And then for large-scale data lakes, we are able to build highly dense object storage or mixed object and file storage landscapes that we have done for many, many clients over the last quarter. Welcome. Thank you. Thanks, Kris. We ended FY '24 strong with robust performance in Q4 and building positive momentum entering FY '25. Capacity flash, block storage, cloud storage services, and AI all represent enormous growth opportunities for us. We are performing well and expect continued growth in these areas. NetApp is leading the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers make their data infrastructure intelligent for the age of AI. We are capitalizing on our share gain opportunity and will maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. Thank you for your time today, and I hope to see you at our June 11th Investor Day."

Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our Q3 FY 2024 call. I'm pleased to report, that we delivered exceptional performance across the board, despite an uncertain macro environment. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by the momentum of our expanded all-flash product portfolio. This strength coupled with continued operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for consolidated gross margin, operating margin, and EPS for the second consecutive quarter. Entering FY 2024, we laid out a plan to drive better performance in our Storage business and build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business, while managing the elements within our control in an uncertain macroeconomy to further improve our profitability. These actions have delivered strong results to-date, support our raised outlook for the year. And enhance our position for the long-term. Only NetApp delivers a comprehensive architecture based on a single operating system, that supports any application or data type, spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments, and is available in traditional CapEx or as-a-service procurement models. Our unified data solutions, address some of the biggest priorities IT organizations face today, modernizing legacy infrastructure, improving resiliency against ransomware attacks, and building scalable, high performance data pipelines for AI workloads. The consistent operations, common management tools, integrated data services, and unique and proven capabilities for Hybrid Cloud of our unified storage architecture, provides customers the ability to simplify at scale and lower storage costs. Our silo-free approach to unified data storage is clearly resonating with customers, driving healthy demand for our products and services, and positioning us well to deliver long-term growth. Turning to the results of the quarter, we delivered robust year-over-year performance in our Hybrid Cloud segment with revenue growth of 6% and product revenue growth of 10%, driven by momentum from our newly introduced all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year. Strong customer demand for our industry leading all-flash solutions drove all-flash growth of 21% year-over-year, to an all-time high annualized revenue run rate of $3.4 billion. In Q3, our all-flash business expanded to approximately 60% of Hybrid Cloud segment revenue. As Mike will detail, we expect a sustainable step-up in our baseline product gross margin going forward with the continued revenue shift to all-flash. The AFF C-Series all-flash arrays again exceeded our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. As customers modernize Legacy 10k Hard Disk Drives and Hybrid Flash environments, we are displacing competitors' installed bases with our All-Flash Solutions, driving share gains. Our newly introduced ASA families, of SAN-optimized, high-performance and capacity-oriented all-flash arrays also outperformed our expectations. We're excited about the enormous potential in the nearly $20 billion SAN market. Our modern all-flash SAN arrays, backed by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees, are well-positioned to redefine the competitive landscape. In Q3, we had numerous competitive take-outs across a broad set of workloads and vertical markets as customers leveraged our C-Series and ASA products to modernize their legacy infrastructures and deploy new applications like Artificial Intelligence. We continue to see strong interest in our advanced portfolio of Ransomware Protection Solutions. We help customers, take proactive steps to protect, detect, and recover their data. Competitive Solutions focus only on data recovery, but NetApp keeps data protected and secured from the start with products designed to block cybersecurity risks and mitigate the high cost of downtime. ONTAP is the first Enterprise-Class Storage Solution validated by the NSA for the Commercial Solutions for Classified Program, demonstrating the strength of our state-of-the-art, data protection and cybersecurity solutions. We saw good momentum in AI, with dozens of customer wins in the quarter, including several large NVIDIA SuperPOD and BasePOD deployments. We help organizations in use cases that range from unifying their data in modern data lakes to deploying large model training environments, and to operationalize those models into production environments. To best take advantage of Generative AI capabilities, customers are looking to augment foundational models with their own data. Our high-performance, scalable unified data storage systems create intelligent data pipelines that allow customers to capture, aggregate and prepare their data for AI. NetApp delivers the data management capabilities for security, performance, and simplicity that enterprises require for their GenAI workflows. We continue to advance our position with the development of GenAI driven cloud and on-premises solutions in partnership with industry leaders. Demand for consumption options is also growing as some customers look to increase budget flexibility in an ongoing uncertain macro and higher interest rate environment. However, this is not a universal mandate. Our unified data storage solutions are available as CapEx, as-a-service, and cloud native offerings, providing customers with the widest range of buying options, enabling them to meet their budget requirements. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering, delivered another strong quarter, with revenue growing triple-digits from Q3 a year ago. Keystone is a great solution for customers who want a cloud-like operating model on premises. For customers who are ready to move to the cloud, we uniquely partner with the leading hyperscalers to deliver cloud-native storage services. Public Cloud segment revenue was $151 million, up 1% year-over-year. First party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our priority and are growing rapidly, with the ARR of these services up more than 35% year-over-year. These offerings are highly differentiated and tightly aligned to customer buying preference. We continue to deepen our hyperscaler partnerships, and deliver growth in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR with this part of the portfolio. As I outlined last quarter, we are taking action to sharpen our approach to our Public Cloud business. As a part of this plan, we exited two small services in the quarter. We also began the work of refocusing Cloud Insights and InstaClustr to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings and integrating some standalone services into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes to widen our competitive moat. In Q4, we anticipate approximately $20 million in ARR headwinds from unrenewed subscriptions. This will create minimal revenue impact and should be largely offset by growth in first-party and marketplace services. We will continue refining our focus in fiscal year 2025, building a stronger base from which to grow. Our hyperscaler partnerships and natively integrated storage services, position us to address the new and emerging GenAI opportunity in the cloud. A leading open-source developer of GenAI tools, datasets and models is leveraging AWS\u2019 FSx for NetApp ONTAP as a part of its offerings. The customer was looking for a high-performance and resilient file storage solution to train extensive AI/ML workloads. FSxN gave them a scalable solution with performant storage for intensive AI model training. As a fully managed service, FSxN removes operational burdens, allowing their DevOps teams to focus on business value activities. In summary, we entered the final quarter of fiscal year '24 in a much stronger position than we were at the start of the year despite the ongoing macro uncertainty, our modern approach to unified data storage, which spans data types, price points and hybrid multi-cloud environments is resonating in the market. We are successfully executing against our top priorities, growing in all flash and cloud storage services. We are well positioned with an expanded TAM, including block storage, and new market opportunities like AI to drive continued growth and share gains. We are moving to a higher product margin profile, supported by growth in all-flash products. And we will continue to maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. I'm very pleased with our momentum and very confident in our ability to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. Finally, I want to make you aware of our June 11, Investor Day, where we will provide an update on our long-term strategy and business model. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, all numbers I will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. Our focus and strong execution again delivered record-setting results, reaching all-time highs across key profitability measures, including consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, net income and EPS. Before I discuss the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As George noted, we continue to see positive results from our new all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we implemented at the start of the fiscal year. The momentum from our industry-leading flash portfolio, coupled with our operational discipline, drove both top and bottom line growth in the quarter. Q3 consolidated gross margin of 73% and product gross margin of 63% and were both at all-time highs for the second consecutive quarter. Gross margin leverage and operating discipline drove operating margin of 30% and EPS of $1.94, both also setting company records for the second consecutive quarter. Q3 operating cash flow came in at $484 million, and free cash flow was $448 million. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least $1.3 billion, tracking relatively in line with net income. The strong execution of our priorities of winning in flash and growing first-party cloud services are clearly paying off. Given our strong execution of results that met or beat our guidance ranges, while driving record-setting profitability measures for the second consecutive quarter, we are once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Looking ahead, we are even more confident in our position to drive long-term revenue growth and profitability. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q3 billings increased 7% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, driven by momentum in our all-flash array product families. Hybrid cloud revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and product revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $747 million. Support revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $631 million. We are pleased with the success of moving the responsibility for the majority of our renewals to the customer success team implemented as a part of our go-to-market focus. Public cloud revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $151 million. As expected, growth was driven by our first party and marketplace cloud storage services offset by declines in subscription services. Now for our operating results. Q3 consolidated gross margin was 73%. Gross profit margin dollars increased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion driven by strong growth of product gross profit dollars. Q3 product gross margin of 63% was 250 basis points higher than the high-end of our guide, primarily driven by better-than-expected mix shift to all-flash products and pricing discipline in what remains a cost-sensitive environment. Operating expenses of $682 million increased 5% year-over-year and declined slightly from Q2 as expected. As a result of operating leverage and disciplined management, Q3 operating profit dollars increased 30% year-over-year to $485 million and operating margin increased 580 basis points from a year ago to 30%, a record for the second consecutive quarter. EPS grew 42% year-over-year to a record high of $1.94. Our tax rate was 18%, lower than expected due to an adjustment of our full year tax rate. Normalizing for a tax rate of 21.5%, EPS would still have been a record high of $1.86. Q3 operating cash flow of $484 million was up 28% year-over-year, and free cash flow was up 40% year-over-year, driven by solid billings and profitability. DSO was 45% and inventory turns were 14, both consistent with expectations. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $1.1 billion increased 23% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $203 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $526 million in net cash. Year-to-date, we have generated $963 million in free cash flow and returned more than 100% to stockholders. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q3 was $4.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. Before moving to Q4 and fiscal 2024 guidance, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our product gross margin expectations going forward. We have seen the price increases on NAND from suppliers, and these increases will impact all industry participants. The mix shift to our higher-margin all-flash products will partially offset the headwinds from these price increases going forward. As a result of our shift to all-flash, we expect product gross margin to expand to the upper 50% to 60% from our historical norm of approximately 55%. Please note, in any given quarter, commodity prices, product mix, and the pricing environment will cause product gross margin to fluctuate from this new baseline. That being said, I want to make sure to reiterate this point: even with the increase in commodity costs we fully expect our product gross margins to expand to the upper 50% to 60% level driven by the shift to our all-flash portfolio. Now let\u2019s turn to guidance. As George noted, we are pleased with the results of our focus and continued operational discipline. Given our better-than-expected results and our improved outlook for Q4, we are again raising our FY 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $6.185 to $6.335 billion, or $6.26 billion at the midpoint. We expect to see continued strength in all-flash products and Hyperscaler First Party and Marketplace Services. FY 2024 consolidated gross margin is expected to be in the range of 71% to 72%. Product gross margin is expected to be approximately 60%, driven by the continued favorable mix shift to all-flash products. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 27% and EPS to be in the range of $6.40 to $6.50, with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $40 million and share count of 212 million. Our full year tax rate is projected to be 20%. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least, $1.3 billion. In Q4, we expect revenue to range between $1.585 billion and $1.735 billion, which at the midpoint of $1.66 billion implies an increase of 5% year-over-year. We expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 71%, and product gross margin to be approximately 60%. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 27% to 28%. Implied in this guidance, we expect operating expenses to increase from Q3 due mainly to higher incentive compensation, the timing of marketing programs and targeted investment to drive key product roadmap items. Our tax rate is expected to be 20% and EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.83. Also please note that our purchase commitments for NAND for FY 2025 demand will impact our cash flow and balance sheet in Q4, which is included in our updated cash flow forecast and will result in inventory turns to be in the eight to 10 times range. In closing, I want to thank our customers, partners, employees and stockholders for their unwavering commitment and investment in NetApp. We continue to prove our ability to manage the elements within our control and our solid top-line results demonstrate the value that customers realized from our products and services. Our innovative portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments and we remain committed to delivering sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I guess, George, you went into a lot of detail just around what you're seeing on the AI side. I guess if you could just get a sense of when you're seeing the timing of maybe people making investments versus -- kind of the various stages of AI? And then maybe just as a follow-up question, just what you're seeing in terms of the competitive environment just in terms of kind of innovative thinking around AI solutions. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you for your question. I think we're in the early phases of the GenAI opportunity. As you know, we have been in the AI market for a long time and have seen a lot of examples of proven use cases in predictive AI. We are starting to see the early phases of Generative AI. And what I mean by that is customers collecting and unifying their data and starting to augment the foundational models with their own data, so that it is more relevant to their business. We expect that to continue for several months or a year, and we think that the deployment of production models and the movement from training to inferencing, becomes more relevant as we head into next year. With regard to the work that we have seen, we had a really strong quarter in the flash business. And we\u2019ve got several eight-figure deals in Q3, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies build their AI supercomputer NetApp, one of the world's largest genomics company relying on our technology to speed up genomic analysis with NVIDIA and NetApp, one of the world's largest media companies is using us to drive some of the early phases of their Generative AI work. And we also have examples in the public cloud where one of the world's largest open source model providers is using NetApp's cloud technology to enable their customers to access and train their models. So we've got real many different examples of success. I think if you draw out our strength is scale and performance, super part certification, the fact that we can build a hybrid cloud data pipeline and the data management capabilities that we've had for many years that allow you to do things like model versioning, security for your mission-critical data and be able to deploy and connect data pipelines from production back into training. So I feel really good about our strength in the AI market. It's early around GenAI, and we are doing the work to expand our opportunity there.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nEddie Pellon: Hey guys, this is Eddie for Chris. Congrats on the great execution here. George, I think many people still underappreciate how file services is an AI beneficiary. For example, if you set up an AWS SageMaker account, developers can have plenty of file services options, including NetApp's FSX, so maybe talk about what differentiates FSX versus other file services, and what kind of customers you attract, what use cases is it used for? And if you can touch on how big ANF and FSX are within public cloud, that would be great. I do have another question, please.\nGeorge Kurian: First of all, I think that unstructured data is the vast majority of the value in Generative AI. Generative AI really operates on documents and objects and videos and images and a variety of those data sets. And as you know, NetApp has a huge percentage of the enterprises unstructured data stored or systems. We help them in a few different ways. One way that we help them is if their data science team that's building AI training and building some of their models, wants to start in the public cloud, you can very quickly and easily take data from your enterprise environment securely into the public cloud and use it in the public cloud. Second, as you know, we have very high performance scale-out solutions like the one that we referred to on the call, we're one of the world's largest open source model providers is using our high-performance scale-out SSX solutions on Amazon to do model training. And then the third is in the enterprise itself, if the enterprise wants to scale that production environment, we have certifications with NVIDIA, for example, that allows them to quickly build a super part with us, train it and then deploy the trained models into production. So we feel very, very confident about the expanding opportunity in front of us. We've had several good wins and we are investing to expand our opportunity in this space.\nEddie Pellon: That's very helpful, George. Thank you. And one for Mike quickly. Can you give a fresh, please our memory about how customer behavior has historically changed when NAND prices increase aggressively in short periods of time? Like do they usually reduce purchases of all flash arrays and go more to hybrids? Or is NAND a small percentage of the bill of materials today, because of a very low pricing, where a 50% increase in NAND prices, for example, will not meaningfully change the system price you guys charge customers. That's it for me. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Yes. Eddie, there was a lot of questions in there. What we'd say is a couple of things. Remember, customers' budget based on dollars, and that's the way that they purchased. We haven't seen anything like in the last year in terms of really NAND prices declining as much as they did. More than anything, we think that, that has made SSD flash technology more affordable, all the benefits that you get around environmentals and economics as well as energy now make that a much better economic decision for them. So that's really the change that we've seen. Short-term -- other short-term changes really don't change the market that much because, again, these are long-term decisions companies are making.\nGeorge Kurian: And just to add to that, SSDs are not 50%. They are less than 50% of our bill of materials or probably anybody else's bill of materials.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Cardoso: Hey. Thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. So, first one for me. It seems like you continue to see strong momentum with the C-Series and the other new flash products that you guys have introduced and they even appear to be outperforming your expectation in each quarter. So just curious, if you could talk to how momentum for those products have tracked through 3Q and into 4Q to-date. It doesn't sound like you're seeing any signs of that momentum slowing down, but can you just confirm that. And do you expect that we're still very much in the early innings of these product cycles with your customers? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. Maybe I can address that in three ways. I think the C-Series product cycle is to modernize both, traditional hybrid flash systems as well as deploy new private cloud environments, and we are seeing strong advantages there. That's the first use case. And you can see we do not see any end to that. The 10-K drive transition is a multiyear transition. We're in the early stages of that. On the private cloud side, I think some of the changes in licensing that some of the software vendors have, have renewed interest in our technology as a vehicle to give them -- give customers a path to the future. The second opportunity is the ASA product family. NetApp has had a long history in the block storage space, we've had tens of thousands of customers using our technology to serve block workloads, and we are in the early innings of bringing out a package solution that's focused solely on the block market. And we've been pleased with both of those use cases. And then the third area, of course, which is set for rapid expansion and growth is AI. And I feel really, really good with the focus on execution. Every time we've set a set of targets internally, we've been them and we've raised them externally. And so, we got strong momentum. We're going to stay focused and disciplined in our execution going forward.\nJoe Cardoso: Got it. I appreciate the color there, George. And then just as my second one, it appears the appetite from customers to consume storage more on a consumption basis is increasing based on our checks with the channel as well as comments from you and your peers. I know you touched on the driver being in some part due to this uneven macro that we're seeing. But are you seeing anything else as a driver there, like the maturity around the offerings or go-to-market motion. The reason I'm asking, it just feels like it wasn't too long ago when the opportunity here felt more theoretical and there was not as much appetite coming from the customers. So I would just be interested to hear, like has anything changed on that front? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think there's probably two or three things. I think the maturity of the offerings. I think customers comfort around how they would procure cloud-like models. I think the second is the increase in interest rates that on the margin caused certain customers to think about CapEx versus OpEx. And then the third, of course, is the customers that are in transition from one environment to another. For example, when you're in a data center transition and you've got a portion of the life of a data center environment that needs to be continued, moving to an as-a-service model is a good transition point. We have offered as a service for many years. Clearly, the most flexible, the fastest and the easiest to build an elastic environment, is around true public cloud. We also have solutions with colocation providers like Equinix that allows the customer to get a full cloud-like opportunity in a colocation environment, connected to the Public Cloud and our Keystone service in the customers' data centers had another really strong quarter. We are up year-to-date almost more than triple-digits, including this past quarter. So we see strong momentum in that category. And we do not see a mandate for it, but it's a nice new way for us to address a set of customer buying preferences.\nJoe Cardoso: Great. You appreciate the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question today comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. George, I just wanted to better understand the current competitive landscape for fiber storage market, especially given the AI application. And I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: It's always big competitive. There are different vendors that come and go in the market. I think if you look at the installed base of unstructured data, that becomes the vehicle to build data pipelines for AI and ML applications, NetApp has a very strong position. And we have the only solutions that allow customers to build hybrid cloud pipelines to build solutions that are super scalable and high performance. But also have the security protection and data management that AI will need as these models get scaled. So I feel really good about our position and look forward to continuing to expand our presence in that market.\nMehdi Hosseini: Maybe perhaps I could rephrase my question. Mike just, raised is product gross margin to 60%, which is pretty much what you're guiding for the January quarter. You're also increasing use of QLC. So should we anticipate some flexibility with pricing that QLC gives you, by remaining competitive with your competitors? Because I don't see gross margins already at work the new target is. So where do we go from here?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think that, first of all, the mix shift from hard drives to flash, in our business continues. And it's an important kind of underlying factor that gives us confidence that we are raising the structural baseline product gross margin, as Mike said, from the mid-50s, which has been a historic norm to the upper-50s and up to 60%. The mix shift is the most important lever in that equation. The second, of course, is the value of our ONTAP Software and the ongoing management of the commodity supply chain. I think all of those, factor in. I think that we are uniquely positioned with our operating system to benefit from using QLC in a broad bench of applications. Currently, only another one other vendor has QLC based all-flash arrays, and it gives us an opportunity to go target other vendors who don't have QLC support. So we feel really good about our solution. And I would tell you that AI and all of these enterprise applications are not just about price. They're about value, and we built a real good value for our customers over many years.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nMike Cadiz: Hi, good afternoon. This is Mike Cadiz for Asiya at Citi. So my one question is, given ongoing -- in the AI field, given ongoing security and data sovereignty concerns by many companies, is there anything notable in the customer conversations regarding AI model placements, whether on-prem or in the cloud or any other architecture preferences that they may have?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think that data is the foundation on, which AI is built. And if you look at what enterprises are doing today, they are augmenting foundational models with their own data to bring the relevance of AI to their business and their organizational needs. As a result, issues like malicious injection of bad data into a data landscape can cause huge impacts on AI, the ability to maintain data security, privacy, and lineage is are all conversations that are happening regardless of the regulatory environment, and they will only get stronger as the regulations get enforced like you are seeing, for example, in the European Union. This gives the needs to have data management across the life cycle of AI extreme importance, and we are exceptionally well-positioned, having the capabilities to build secure, private environments in the public cloud, as well as in customers' data centers.\nMike Cadiz: Okay, got it. Thank you very much. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: Hey, thanks, and congrats on the strong results here. Mike, can you give us some early thoughts on fiscal year 2025. And what are the key things we should be thinking about when modeling fiscal year 2025 here?\nMike Berry: Yes. Thank you for the question, Nehal. So when going into fiscal 2025, we've talked about it, hey, we feel really good about the momentum that we have in Q3 as well as the guidance that we built in Q4. We've talked about the momentum around C-Series. George talked about all the industry, trends that are also tailwinds for us. And when you look at all of the priorities that our customers are looking at, we feel like we're really well-positioned. We've given you a good view of where we think our product gross margins will land. The support business continues to be an important driver of profitability as well. And we will continue to be prudent around our investment to make sure that we drive growth. We want to do that. We want to make sure that we are disciplined in our spending. But hey, there are some things that we also need to do and want to do to be able to continue to drive the top line. I think we've done a lot of great work around cloud to be in a much better position for next year. George talked about the 35%-plus growth in cloud storage in first-party marketplace. And Eddie asked that question as well. In the quarter, cloud storage continues to grow as a percentage. It's now closer to 65% from a revenue perspective. So that's where the growth will be. And then, we will continue to do the right things around return of capital to shareholders. We always want to leave flexibility for investments, but we also want to make sure that we're mindful of our share count. So without trying to guide 2025, that's only the best Readers Digest version, I can give you.\nNehal Chokshi: That's fantastic. If I may, how should we think about the support revenue? You're coming off 4 quarters of year-over-year product revenue declines now that you're back into year-over-year growth on the product revenue, how long do you expect the Support revenue start to cut back up basically?\nMike Berry: Yes, great question. And we look at this a lot, obviously. So in the last two quarters, we've seen deferred revenue actually decline year-over-year. A couple of things to haul, keep in mind, that what you see on the balance sheet as a total deferred, it also includes cloud that has declined a little bit more than the Support business in the last two quarters. 90% plus Support will come off the balance sheet, so you can take a hard look at that. But what we've also seen is a different trend where instead of tech refreshes we've seen a lot of customers renew their Support for up to a year, and that has also helped continue to drive Support revenue. You don't see that as much in deferred. But the big driver will be growth in product revenue drives additional Support revenue with the multiyear Support. You'll see that in billings. You'll see that in deferred revenue. So we feel good about being able to get that growth in Support. I think it was 2% this year, hopefully, at least that and going forward, if product -- when product revenue grows, support revenue should follow. It will be a little bit of a lagging indicator a couple of quarters, but it will definitely follow because of the business model.\nNehal Chokshi: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Yes. Congrats I mean congrats on a strong number of quarters here and really good ongoing execution. And I guess George, that's I guess what I'd like to ask, I guess the first question is -- and I'm sorry if you spoke to some of this, I was -- there's a few calls going on tonight. So I came on late. But to what degree the last couple of quarters or so, do you think that the strong product growth that you guys have put up. I'm going to try to actually parse to the degree that's possible. Is the result of new product features, kind of new products, things that customers are doing beginning to do sort of differently with their data? It sounds like not really a material GNA benefit yet, which makes sense. But if you could parse -- if there's any way to parse through those things, that would be helpful. And then, I guess the second part of the question is, I think I heard you make mention of you think there is like a tail to this going forward. And I mean is part of what you're saying is that you think the product demand sort of outlook begins to look a lot different as you go through calendar 2024 and then maybe even beyond? I know that's a lot, but I'd appreciate that. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. Listen, I think, first of all, the macro has stayed relatively consistent the whole time. It is uncertain. It's not getting worse, but it is not the fundamental reason for the improvement in results. The second is the two biggest reasons for improving our results. One is product and the second is focus on go-to-market execution. Let me hit on, in terms of product, we brought the world's best operating system to two or three major new opportunities. We brought it to a price point in the all-flash market that we have not addressed before with the QLC flash offerings. We brought the world's best operating system to a block storage opportunity that multibillion dollars, multiple tens of billion dollars that we had never built a purpose-built block storage product for. And we are continuing to see an expanding range of AI opportunities as customers are doing both training as well as building context called retrieval augmented generation drag. And so all of those have driven improvements in our results. I think the other part of the equation would be to recognize the benefits that we've had from focus in our go-to-market. We have prioritized two areas; the hyperscaler marketplace and first-party cloud storage services in public cloud. And we have focused on our all-flash portfolio as the two major priorities, and we have had strong results in both of them, and I'm very pleased with the results.\nAnanda Baruah: That's great context. I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up for Mike here. Mike, you talked about attach in some context. And I guess I just wanted to ask you with the operating margins already in the high 20s, philosophically, is there any reason why with everything you have going on with mix and attach over time, you couldn't touch 30% operating margin?\nMike Berry: So we did this quarter, Ananda.\nAnanda Baruah: Sorry, it's funny. I haven't -- yes, I apologize. I have to with all the numbers I had you didn't -- that's a miss on me. So well, let me just ask you then, let's start there. Like I mean, should we just expect mix up then going forward? I mean, how are you thinking about like showing the margins in the P&L versus doing something else with the op income dollars as mix continues to work in your favor? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Yes. And no apologies necessary. I know you folks are busy today. So hey, we're super excited about the 30% margin. And a lot of that. There's all 12,000 employees that helped us on that number. We've guided to 27% to 28% inQ4. What I would say is that we very much want to continue to be able to grow the business. And even as a CFO, I know, hey, we need to invest in some areas. There are some product investments that we need to make. We want to make sure that the go-to-market continues to have sales capacity. We've said it at the last Analyst Day, we'll say it again, which is we want to invest, but our goal is always to grow OpEx at a lower rate than revenue to drive the margins up. Where those go really depends, I think, on a couple of things. One is how well we can continue to grow product revenue, that's obviously a big piece. And that then drives storage, which was Nehal's question around -- I'm sorry, around which is a big piece. So we don't have a target in mind. And quite frankly, the other thing I just want to make sure and underline, this is both gross -- product gross margins and operating margins. Hey, we love the dollars more. And so our goal is to be able to drive dollars. That may mean that, hey, margins stay relatively consistent or they go up or down in a quarter. Our goal is to drive more revenue, more gross margin dollars, more operating that then goes to EPS. So I don't want to give you a target. Now we'll talk about this a little bit in June. There is that trade-off.\nAnanda Baruah: Thank you. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks a lot, Mike.\nMike Berry: Thanks, Ananda\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. This is Irvin Liu on for Amit. George, you mentioned new customer wins resulting from the displacement of competitor 10K hard disk drive and hybrid deployments with C Series. But can you give us a sense on what the upsell opportunity looks like for some of your other product lines such as A series and public cloud services, particularly with these new customers.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, we always start with one environment, and then we can cross-sell other environments into the customer. I think what we have seen quite clearly in the market is that the idea of having multiple different operating systems and storage landscapes in our customer is causing cost, complexity and security vulnerabilities and the idea of going to one consistent architecture across multiple landscapes is clearly seeing resonance and customers. And I think that as we have got obviously both unified, as well as block focused offerings across high-performance AFF A Series, as well as more value-oriented C-Series products, we see opportunity to not only win one part of our customers' footprint, but over time, win all of their footprint. The work that we've done in public cloud allows us to penetrate accounts that we don't have a relationship with using the public cloud sales motion. And as we have shared many times, the number of new to NetApp customers in the public cloud sales motion is very strong, and we are excited about that. We continue to see good progress on that front even this past quarter.\nIrvin Liu: Thanks. I also had one follow-up. Just on the dip in your mix of U.S. public sector revenue. Was there anything to call out here just in terms of government IT spending?\nGeorge Kurian: It's just normal seasonality. I think public sector actually was a strong number for us across the globe and nothing other than normal seasonality for us.\nIrvin Liu: Got it. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Irvin.. I'm going to pass it back to George now for some closing comments.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you, Kris. Let me reiterate my strong confidence in our position to drive continued growth and profitability despite the uncertain macro. We've sharpened our focus, improved our execution and successfully introduced new products that expand our addressable market. Capacity flash, block storage and AI all represent enormous opportunities for us. We are performing well in these areas and expect continued growth. We have taken the actions needed to improve the health of our cloud business, creating our healthier business to drive growth in fiscal 2025. We are capitalizing on our share gain opportunity and we'll maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. Thank you for your time today, and I hope to see you at our June 11, Investor Day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, all numbers I will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. Our focus and strong execution again delivered record-setting results, reaching all-time highs across key profitability measures, including consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, net income and EPS. Before I discuss the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As George noted, we continue to see positive results from our new all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we implemented at the start of the fiscal year. The momentum from our industry-leading flash portfolio, coupled with our operational discipline, drove both top and bottom line growth in the quarter. Q3 consolidated gross margin of 73% and product gross margin of 63% and were both at all-time highs for the second consecutive quarter. Gross margin leverage and operating discipline drove operating margin of 30% and EPS of $1.94, both also setting company records for the second consecutive quarter. Q3 operating cash flow came in at $484 million, and free cash flow was $448 million. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least $1.3 billion, tracking relatively in line with net income. The strong execution of our priorities of winning in flash and growing first-party cloud services are clearly paying off. Given our strong execution of results that met or beat our guidance ranges, while driving record-setting profitability measures for the second consecutive quarter, we are once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Looking ahead, we are even more confident in our position to drive long-term revenue growth and profitability. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q3 billings increased 7% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, driven by momentum in our all-flash array product families. Hybrid cloud revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and product revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $747 million. Support revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $631 million. We are pleased with the success of moving the responsibility for the majority of our renewals to the customer success team implemented as a part of our go-to-market focus. Public cloud revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $151 million. As expected, growth was driven by our first party and marketplace cloud storage services offset by declines in subscription services. Now for our operating results. Q3 consolidated gross margin was 73%. Gross profit margin dollars increased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion driven by strong growth of product gross profit dollars. Q3 product gross margin of 63% was 250 basis points higher than the high-end of our guide, primarily driven by better-than-expected mix shift to all-flash products and pricing discipline in what remains a cost-sensitive environment. Operating expenses of $682 million increased 5% year-over-year and declined slightly from Q2 as expected. As a result of operating leverage and disciplined management, Q3 operating profit dollars increased 30% year-over-year to $485 million and operating margin increased 580 basis points from a year ago to 30%, a record for the second consecutive quarter. EPS grew 42% year-over-year to a record high of $1.94. Our tax rate was 18%, lower than expected due to an adjustment of our full year tax rate. Normalizing for a tax rate of 21.5%, EPS would still have been a record high of $1.86. Q3 operating cash flow of $484 million was up 28% year-over-year, and free cash flow was up 40% year-over-year, driven by solid billings and profitability. DSO was 45% and inventory turns were 14, both consistent with expectations. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $1.1 billion increased 23% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $203 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $526 million in net cash. Year-to-date, we have generated $963 million in free cash flow and returned more than 100% to stockholders. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q3 was $4.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. Before moving to Q4 and fiscal 2024 guidance, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our product gross margin expectations going forward. We have seen the price increases on NAND from suppliers, and these increases will impact all industry participants. The mix shift to our higher-margin all-flash products will partially offset the headwinds from these price increases going forward. As a result of our shift to all-flash, we expect product gross margin to expand to the upper 50% to 60% from our historical norm of approximately 55%. Please note, in any given quarter, commodity prices, product mix, and the pricing environment will cause product gross margin to fluctuate from this new baseline. That being said, I want to make sure to reiterate this point: even with the increase in commodity costs we fully expect our product gross margins to expand to the upper 50% to 60% level driven by the shift to our all-flash portfolio. Now let's turn to guidance. As George noted, we are pleased with the results of our focus and continued operational discipline. Given our better-than-expected results and our improved outlook for Q4, we are again raising our FY 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $6.185 to $6.335 billion, or $6.26 billion at the midpoint. We expect to see continued strength in all-flash products and Hyperscaler First Party and Marketplace Services. FY 2024 consolidated gross margin is expected to be in the range of 71% to 72%. Product gross margin is expected to be approximately 60%, driven by the continued favorable mix shift to all-flash products. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 27% and EPS to be in the range of $6.40 to $6.50, with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $40 million and share count of 212 million. Our full year tax rate is projected to be 20%. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least, $1.3 billion. In Q4, we expect revenue to range between $1.585 billion and $1.735 billion, which at the midpoint of $1.66 billion implies an increase of 5% year-over-year. We expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 71%, and product gross margin to be approximately 60%. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 27% to 28%. Implied in this guidance, we expect operating expenses to increase from Q3 due mainly to higher incentive compensation, the timing of marketing programs and targeted investment to drive key product roadmap items. Our tax rate is expected to be 20% and EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.83. Also please note that our purchase commitments for NAND for FY 2025 demand will impact our cash flow and balance sheet in Q4, which is included in our updated cash flow forecast and will result in inventory turns to be in the eight to 10 times range. In closing, I want to thank our customers, partners, employees and stockholders for their unwavering commitment and investment in NetApp. We continue to prove our ability to manage the elements within our control and our solid top-line results demonstrate the value that customers realized from our products and services. Our innovative portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments and we remain committed to delivering sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris? Yes. Eddie, there was a lot of questions in there. What we'd say is a couple of things. Remember, customers' budget based on dollars, and that's the way that they purchased. We haven't seen anything like in the last year in terms of really NAND prices declining as much as they did. More than anything, we think that, that has made SSD flash technology more affordable, all the benefits that you get around environmentals and economics as well as energy now make that a much better economic decision for them. So that's really the change that we've seen. Short-term -- other short-term changes really don't change the market that much because, again, these are long-term decisions companies are making. Yes. Thank you for the question, Nehal. So when going into fiscal 2025, we've talked about it, hey, we feel really good about the momentum that we have in Q3 as well as the guidance that we built in Q4. We've talked about the momentum around C-Series. George talked about all the industry, trends that are also tailwinds for us. And when you look at all of the priorities that our customers are looking at, we feel like we're really well-positioned. We've given you a good view of where we think our product gross margins will land. The support business continues to be an important driver of profitability as well. And we will continue to be prudent around our investment to make sure that we drive growth. We want to do that. We want to make sure that we are disciplined in our spending. But hey, there are some things that we also need to do and want to do to be able to continue to drive the top line. I think we've done a lot of great work around cloud to be in a much better position for next year. George talked about the 35%-plus growth in cloud storage in first-party marketplace. And Eddie asked that question as well. In the quarter, cloud storage continues to grow as a percentage. It's now closer to 65% from a revenue perspective. So that's where the growth will be. And then, we will continue to do the right things around return of capital to shareholders. We always want to leave flexibility for investments, but we also want to make sure that we're mindful of our share count. So without trying to guide 2025, that's only the best Readers Digest version, I can give you. Yes, great question. And we look at this a lot, obviously. So in the last two quarters, we've seen deferred revenue actually decline year-over-year. A couple of things to haul, keep in mind, that what you see on the balance sheet as a total deferred, it also includes cloud that has declined a little bit more than the Support business in the last two quarters. 90% plus Support will come off the balance sheet, so you can take a hard look at that. But what we've also seen is a different trend where instead of tech refreshes we've seen a lot of customers renew their Support for up to a year, and that has also helped continue to drive Support revenue. You don't see that as much in deferred. But the big driver will be growth in product revenue drives additional Support revenue with the multiyear Support. You'll see that in billings. You'll see that in deferred revenue. So we feel good about being able to get that growth in Support. I think it was 2% this year, hopefully, at least that and going forward, if product -- when product revenue grows, support revenue should follow. It will be a little bit of a lagging indicator a couple of quarters, but it will definitely follow because of the business model. So we did this quarter, Ananda. Yes. And no apologies necessary. I know you folks are busy today. So hey, we're super excited about the 30% margin. And a lot of that. There's all 12,000 employees that helped us on that number. We've guided to 27% to 28% inQ4. What I would say is that we very much want to continue to be able to grow the business. And even as a CFO, I know, hey, we need to invest in some areas. There are some product investments that we need to make. We want to make sure that the go-to-market continues to have sales capacity. We've said it at the last Analyst Day, we'll say it again, which is we want to invest, but our goal is always to grow OpEx at a lower rate than revenue to drive the margins up. Where those go really depends, I think, on a couple of things. One is how well we can continue to grow product revenue, that's obviously a big piece. And that then drives storage, which was Nehal's question around -- I'm sorry, around which is a big piece. So we don't have a target in mind. And quite frankly, the other thing I just want to make sure and underline, this is both gross -- product gross margins and operating margins. Hey, we love the dollars more. And so our goal is to be able to drive dollars. That may mean that, hey, margins stay relatively consistent or they go up or down in a quarter. Our goal is to drive more revenue, more gross margin dollars, more operating that then goes to EPS. So I don't want to give you a target. Now we'll talk about this a little bit in June. There is that trade-off. Thanks, Ananda"

            "name": "George Kurian",
            "content": "Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our Q3 FY 2024 call. I'm pleased to report, that we delivered exceptional performance across the board, despite an uncertain macro environment. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by the momentum of our expanded all-flash product portfolio. This strength coupled with continued operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for consolidated gross margin, operating margin, and EPS for the second consecutive quarter. Entering FY 2024, we laid out a plan to drive better performance in our Storage business and build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business, while managing the elements within our control in an uncertain macroeconomy to further improve our profitability. These actions have delivered strong results to-date, support our raised outlook for the year. And enhance our position for the long-term. Only NetApp delivers a comprehensive architecture based on a single operating system, that supports any application or data type, spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments, and is available in traditional CapEx or as-a-service procurement models. Our unified data solutions, address some of the biggest priorities IT organizations face today, modernizing legacy infrastructure, improving resiliency against ransomware attacks, and building scalable, high performance data pipelines for AI workloads. The consistent operations, common management tools, integrated data services, and unique and proven capabilities for Hybrid Cloud of our unified storage architecture, provides customers the ability to simplify at scale and lower storage costs. Our silo-free approach to unified data storage is clearly resonating with customers, driving healthy demand for our products and services, and positioning us well to deliver long-term growth. Turning to the results of the quarter, we delivered robust year-over-year performance in our Hybrid Cloud segment with revenue growth of 6% and product revenue growth of 10%, driven by momentum from our newly introduced all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year. Strong customer demand for our industry leading all-flash solutions drove all-flash growth of 21% year-over-year, to an all-time high annualized revenue run rate of $3.4 billion. In Q3, our all-flash business expanded to approximately 60% of Hybrid Cloud segment revenue. As Mike will detail, we expect a sustainable step-up in our baseline product gross margin going forward with the continued revenue shift to all-flash. The AFF C-Series all-flash arrays again exceeded our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. As customers modernize Legacy 10k Hard Disk Drives and Hybrid Flash environments, we are displacing competitors' installed bases with our All-Flash Solutions, driving share gains. Our newly introduced ASA families, of SAN-optimized, high-performance and capacity-oriented all-flash arrays also outperformed our expectations. We're excited about the enormous potential in the nearly $20 billion SAN market. Our modern all-flash SAN arrays, backed by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees, are well-positioned to redefine the competitive landscape. In Q3, we had numerous competitive take-outs across a broad set of workloads and vertical markets as customers leveraged our C-Series and ASA products to modernize their legacy infrastructures and deploy new applications like Artificial Intelligence. We continue to see strong interest in our advanced portfolio of Ransomware Protection Solutions. We help customers, take proactive steps to protect, detect, and recover their data. Competitive Solutions focus only on data recovery, but NetApp keeps data protected and secured from the start with products designed to block cybersecurity risks and mitigate the high cost of downtime. ONTAP is the first Enterprise-Class Storage Solution validated by the NSA for the Commercial Solutions for Classified Program, demonstrating the strength of our state-of-the-art, data protection and cybersecurity solutions. We saw good momentum in AI, with dozens of customer wins in the quarter, including several large NVIDIA SuperPOD and BasePOD deployments. We help organizations in use cases that range from unifying their data in modern data lakes to deploying large model training environments, and to operationalize those models into production environments. To best take advantage of Generative AI capabilities, customers are looking to augment foundational models with their own data. Our high-performance, scalable unified data storage systems create intelligent data pipelines that allow customers to capture, aggregate and prepare their data for AI. NetApp delivers the data management capabilities for security, performance, and simplicity that enterprises require for their GenAI workflows. We continue to advance our position with the development of GenAI driven cloud and on-premises solutions in partnership with industry leaders. Demand for consumption options is also growing as some customers look to increase budget flexibility in an ongoing uncertain macro and higher interest rate environment. However, this is not a universal mandate. Our unified data storage solutions are available as CapEx, as-a-service, and cloud native offerings, providing customers with the widest range of buying options, enabling them to meet their budget requirements. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering, delivered another strong quarter, with revenue growing triple-digits from Q3 a year ago. Keystone is a great solution for customers who want a cloud-like operating model on premises. For customers who are ready to move to the cloud, we uniquely partner with the leading hyperscalers to deliver cloud-native storage services. Public Cloud segment revenue was $151 million, up 1% year-over-year. First party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our priority and are growing rapidly, with the ARR of these services up more than 35% year-over-year. These offerings are highly differentiated and tightly aligned to customer buying preference. We continue to deepen our hyperscaler partnerships, and deliver growth in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR with this part of the portfolio. As I outlined last quarter, we are taking action to sharpen our approach to our Public Cloud business. As a part of this plan, we exited two small services in the quarter. We also began the work of refocusing Cloud Insights and InstaClustr to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings and integrating some standalone services into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes to widen our competitive moat. In Q4, we anticipate approximately $20 million in ARR headwinds from unrenewed subscriptions. This will create minimal revenue impact and should be largely offset by growth in first-party and marketplace services. We will continue refining our focus in fiscal year 2025, building a stronger base from which to grow. Our hyperscaler partnerships and natively integrated storage services, position us to address the new and emerging GenAI opportunity in the cloud. A leading open-source developer of GenAI tools, datasets and models is leveraging AWS' FSx for NetApp ONTAP as a part of its offerings. The customer was looking for a high-performance and resilient file storage solution to train extensive AI/ML workloads. FSxN gave them a scalable solution with performant storage for intensive AI model training. As a fully managed service, FSxN removes operational burdens, allowing their DevOps teams to focus on business value activities. In summary, we entered the final quarter of fiscal year '24 in a much stronger position than we were at the start of the year despite the ongoing macro uncertainty, our modern approach to unified data storage, which spans data types, price points and hybrid multi-cloud environments is resonating in the market. We are successfully executing against our top priorities, growing in all flash and cloud storage services. We are well positioned with an expanded TAM, including block storage, and new market opportunities like AI to drive continued growth and share gains. We are moving to a higher product margin profile, supported by growth in all-flash products. And we will continue to maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. I'm very pleased with our momentum and very confident in our ability to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. Finally, I want to make you aware of our June 11, Investor Day, where we will provide an update on our long-term strategy and business model. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Thank you for your question. I think we're in the early phases of the GenAI opportunity. As you know, we have been in the AI market for a long time and have seen a lot of examples of proven use cases in predictive AI. We are starting to see the early phases of Generative AI. And what I mean by that is customers collecting and unifying their data and starting to augment the foundational models with their own data, so that it is more relevant to their business. We expect that to continue for several months or a year, and we think that the deployment of production models and the movement from training to inferencing, becomes more relevant as we head into next year. With regard to the work that we have seen, we had a really strong quarter in the flash business. And we've got several eight-figure deals in Q3, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies build their AI supercomputer NetApp, one of the world's largest genomics company relying on our technology to speed up genomic analysis with NVIDIA and NetApp, one of the world's largest media companies is using us to drive some of the early phases of their Generative AI work. And we also have examples in the public cloud where one of the world's largest open source model providers is using NetApp's cloud technology to enable their customers to access and train their models. So we've got real many different examples of success. I think if you draw out our strength is scale and performance, super part certification, the fact that we can build a hybrid cloud data pipeline and the data management capabilities that we've had for many years that allow you to do things like model versioning, security for your mission-critical data and be able to deploy and connect data pipelines from production back into training. So I feel really good about our strength in the AI market. It's early around GenAI, and we are doing the work to expand our opportunity there. First of all, I think that unstructured data is the vast majority of the value in Generative AI. Generative AI really operates on documents and objects and videos and images and a variety of those data sets. And as you know, NetApp has a huge percentage of the enterprises unstructured data stored or systems. We help them in a few different ways. One way that we help them is if their data science team that's building AI training and building some of their models, wants to start in the public cloud, you can very quickly and easily take data from your enterprise environment securely into the public cloud and use it in the public cloud. Second, as you know, we have very high performance scale-out solutions like the one that we referred to on the call, we're one of the world's largest open source model providers is using our high-performance scale-out SSX solutions on Amazon to do model training. And then the third is in the enterprise itself, if the enterprise wants to scale that production environment, we have certifications with NVIDIA, for example, that allows them to quickly build a super part with us, train it and then deploy the trained models into production. So we feel very, very confident about the expanding opportunity in front of us. We've had several good wins and we are investing to expand our opportunity in this space. And just to add to that, SSDs are not 50%. They are less than 50% of our bill of materials or probably anybody else's bill of materials. Yes. Maybe I can address that in three ways. I think the C-Series product cycle is to modernize both, traditional hybrid flash systems as well as deploy new private cloud environments, and we are seeing strong advantages there. That's the first use case. And you can see we do not see any end to that. The 10-K drive transition is a multiyear transition. We're in the early stages of that. On the private cloud side, I think some of the changes in licensing that some of the software vendors have, have renewed interest in our technology as a vehicle to give them -- give customers a path to the future. The second opportunity is the ASA product family. NetApp has had a long history in the block storage space, we've had tens of thousands of customers using our technology to serve block workloads, and we are in the early innings of bringing out a package solution that's focused solely on the block market. And we've been pleased with both of those use cases. And then the third area, of course, which is set for rapid expansion and growth is AI. And I feel really, really good with the focus on execution. Every time we've set a set of targets internally, we've been them and we've raised them externally. And so, we got strong momentum. We're going to stay focused and disciplined in our execution going forward. I think there's probably two or three things. I think the maturity of the offerings. I think customers comfort around how they would procure cloud-like models. I think the second is the increase in interest rates that on the margin caused certain customers to think about CapEx versus OpEx. And then the third, of course, is the customers that are in transition from one environment to another. For example, when you're in a data center transition and you've got a portion of the life of a data center environment that needs to be continued, moving to an as-a-service model is a good transition point. We have offered as a service for many years. Clearly, the most flexible, the fastest and the easiest to build an elastic environment, is around true public cloud. We also have solutions with colocation providers like Equinix that allows the customer to get a full cloud-like opportunity in a colocation environment, connected to the Public Cloud and our Keystone service in the customers' data centers had another really strong quarter. We are up year-to-date almost more than triple-digits, including this past quarter. So we see strong momentum in that category. And we do not see a mandate for it, but it's a nice new way for us to address a set of customer buying preferences. It's always big competitive. There are different vendors that come and go in the market. I think if you look at the installed base of unstructured data, that becomes the vehicle to build data pipelines for AI and ML applications, NetApp has a very strong position. And we have the only solutions that allow customers to build hybrid cloud pipelines to build solutions that are super scalable and high performance. But also have the security protection and data management that AI will need as these models get scaled. So I feel really good about our position and look forward to continuing to expand our presence in that market. Listen, I think that, first of all, the mix shift from hard drives to flash, in our business continues. And it's an important kind of underlying factor that gives us confidence that we are raising the structural baseline product gross margin, as Mike said, from the mid-50s, which has been a historic norm to the upper-50s and up to 60%. The mix shift is the most important lever in that equation. The second, of course, is the value of our ONTAP Software and the ongoing management of the commodity supply chain. I think all of those, factor in. I think that we are uniquely positioned with our operating system to benefit from using QLC in a broad bench of applications. Currently, only another one other vendor has QLC based all-flash arrays, and it gives us an opportunity to go target other vendors who don't have QLC support. So we feel really good about our solution. And I would tell you that AI and all of these enterprise applications are not just about price. They're about value, and we built a real good value for our customers over many years. Listen, I think that data is the foundation on, which AI is built. And if you look at what enterprises are doing today, they are augmenting foundational models with their own data to bring the relevance of AI to their business and their organizational needs. As a result, issues like malicious injection of bad data into a data landscape can cause huge impacts on AI, the ability to maintain data security, privacy, and lineage is are all conversations that are happening regardless of the regulatory environment, and they will only get stronger as the regulations get enforced like you are seeing, for example, in the European Union. This gives the needs to have data management across the life cycle of AI extreme importance, and we are exceptionally well-positioned, having the capabilities to build secure, private environments in the public cloud, as well as in customers' data centers. Yes. Listen, I think, first of all, the macro has stayed relatively consistent the whole time. It is uncertain. It's not getting worse, but it is not the fundamental reason for the improvement in results. The second is the two biggest reasons for improving our results. One is product and the second is focus on go-to-market execution. Let me hit on, in terms of product, we brought the world's best operating system to two or three major new opportunities. We brought it to a price point in the all-flash market that we have not addressed before with the QLC flash offerings. We brought the world's best operating system to a block storage opportunity that multibillion dollars, multiple tens of billion dollars that we had never built a purpose-built block storage product for. And we are continuing to see an expanding range of AI opportunities as customers are doing both training as well as building context called retrieval augmented generation drag. And so all of those have driven improvements in our results. I think the other part of the equation would be to recognize the benefits that we've had from focus in our go-to-market. We have prioritized two areas; the hyperscaler marketplace and first-party cloud storage services in public cloud. And we have focused on our all-flash portfolio as the two major priorities, and we have had strong results in both of them, and I'm very pleased with the results. Listen, we always start with one environment, and then we can cross-sell other environments into the customer. I think what we have seen quite clearly in the market is that the idea of having multiple different operating systems and storage landscapes in our customer is causing cost, complexity and security vulnerabilities and the idea of going to one consistent architecture across multiple landscapes is clearly seeing resonance and customers. And I think that as we have got obviously both unified, as well as block focused offerings across high-performance AFF A Series, as well as more value-oriented C-Series products, we see opportunity to not only win one part of our customers' footprint, but over time, win all of their footprint. The work that we've done in public cloud allows us to penetrate accounts that we don't have a relationship with using the public cloud sales motion. And as we have shared many times, the number of new to NetApp customers in the public cloud sales motion is very strong, and we are excited about that. We continue to see good progress on that front even this past quarter. It's just normal seasonality. I think public sector actually was a strong number for us across the globe and nothing other than normal seasonality for us. Thank you, Kris. Let me reiterate my strong confidence in our position to drive continued growth and profitability despite the uncertain macro. We've sharpened our focus, improved our execution and successfully introduced new products that expand our addressable market. Capacity flash, block storage and AI all represent enormous opportunities for us. We are performing well in these areas and expect continued growth. We have taken the actions needed to improve the health of our cloud business, creating our healthier business to drive growth in fiscal 2025. We are capitalizing on our share gain opportunity and we'll maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. Thank you for your time today, and I hope to see you at our June 11, Investor Day."

Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Q2 improved on our solid start to FY 2024 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance while our operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. We remain relentlessly focused on managing the elements within our control while driving better performance in our storage business and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive results from these actions, with increased profitability and a stronger position for delivering long-term growth. In Q2, we held our INSIGHT user conference where I witnessed the tangible excitement for the silo-free innovation, our unified data storage provides. It was invigorating to be with the thousands of attendees and hear stories of the extraordinary outcomes NetApp delivers for our customers. NetApp is at the forefront of the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers turn disruption into opportunity with intelligent data infrastructure. Today\u2019s organizations need storage infrastructure that harnesses the power of public and hybrid clouds while keeping data secure and protected from ransomware attacks. They need infrastructure that supports dynamic workloads like AI, cloud-native, and open-source applications. And they need infrastructure that helps to create more sustainable data centers. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, that supports any application, any data type, and spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments. This comprehensive architecture delivers unparalleled simplicity of management, simplicity of deployment, and consistency of automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. We further elevate the customer experience with our BlueXP sustainability dashboard and NetApp Advance a common set of programs and guarantees that include Storage Life Cycle program, which removes the burden of upgrade cycles as well as storage efficiency, ransomware recovery and data availability guarantees. Intelligent data infrastructure combines unified data storage, integrated data services, and intelligent operations, so customers can operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unify their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Looking at the results of the quarter, momentum from new products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year drove 10% quarter-over-quarter growth in hybrid cloud segment revenue to $1.4 billion. Our all-flash array business benefited from the growth of the AFF C-Series increasing 14% from Q1 to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.2 billion. The AFF C-Series all-flash array continues to exceed our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. In the quarter, we successfully competed against an all-flash competitor with C-Series to win a $16 million deal at an Infrastructure-as-a-Service company. The customer was looking for new storage to host a broad variety of critical applications. Our ease of management for large storage environments, unique data resilience, common toolkit across all our storage systems and the right price performance ratio secured our win despite the competitor's attempt to use price once they realize their value proposition was insufficient. ONTAP One, our all-in-one software license that gives customers access to the industry's most comprehensive data management suite has laid the groundwork to future tech refresh and expansion opportunities. Building on the success of the C-Series, we introduced blocked optimized and AI-ready visions. The ASA C-Series family is a solution tailored to deliver high-performance and guaranteed high availability storage for critical applications, databases and VMware infrastructure, coupled with capacity flash to make enterprise-grade block storage more affordable and sustainable than ever. We added the AFF C-Series to the ONTAP AI architecture, lowering the overall cost of entry to scalable AI without sacrificing performance. Keystone, our Storage as a Service offering is also growing rapidly. In Q2, we added performance and availability guarantees to Keystone, expanding on the existing sustainability and storage efficiency guarantees, creating a comprehensive program to keep storage operations running optimally. We also announced NetApp storage on Equinix Metal, powered by Keystone, providing customers with a single subscription to a full stack of compute, networking and storage infrastructure with low-latency interconnection to all major public clouds. Turning to Public Cloud. As we said last quarter, our priority is growing first party cloud storage services. We aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners\u2019 go-to-market structures at the start of the fiscal year and are seeing new customer additions and growth in those services. However, that growth has been masked by weakness in subscription services, which have declined to 23% of Public Cloud ARR. During the quarter, we engaged in a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio. As a result, we will continue to prioritize cloud storage offerings delivered through the hyperscalers, while refocusing some services, such as Cloud Insights and Instaclustr, to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings, creating greater differentiation and additional value for customers. We will integrate other services that are sold as standalone subscriptions today, such as data protection, into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes. We will also carefully manage the transition of cloud storage subscription services to align to customer preference for consumption offerings. And, we have decided to exit the SaaS backup and virtual desktop services. We anticipate ARR headwinds of approximately $55 million from exited services and unrenewed subscriptions in the second half of fiscal year '24. Growth in first party and marketplace services are expected to partially offset this decline, positioning us to enter FY '25 with a more focused and much healthier business from which to grow. Now to the results of the quarter. Public Cloud segment revenue in Q2 was $154 million, flat from Q1 and up 8% year-over-year. Our first party and marketplace offerings are highly differentiated and are tightly aligned with customers\u2019 buying preferences. These services grew over 30% from Q2 a year ago. We continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as increases in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR in this part of the portfolio. In Q2, we extended our partnership with Google with the introduction of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. Now, we are not only the only vendor to have a natively integrated storage service in the public cloud, but we are natively integrated into all three of the leading hyperscale vendors. And we are not standing still with this advantage. Just two months after introducing the GCNV service, we announced the availability of a new lower-cost tier of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, expanding the offering to address a greater range of workloads. These partnerships uniquely position and enable us to participate in the innovation and adoption of AI services in the public cloud. As examples, during Q2, we announced support for Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, as well as cross-protocol, hybrid cloud AI pipelines on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with support for SageMaker Studio notebooks. Our position with the hyperscalers also enables us to displace legacy on-premises competitors as customers migrate workloads to the cloud. A U.S.-based medical equipment company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to replace a competitor\u2019s SAN systems when they moved their database workloads to the cloud. This is the customer\u2019s first engagement with NetApp. Following a successful initial deployment, they are evaluating FSxN for workload consolidation and disaster recovery. Looking forward, our focus is clear and is delivering results. We expect the momentum we saw in Q2 to continue through FY '24, despite continued softness in the demand environment due to the challenging macro. Customers value our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure, and data management which enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely, and sustainably. With recent innovations that enable us to address a broader set of markets more efficiently, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a very solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging macro environment with soft IT spend. Our relentless focus and consistent execution delivered results that met and exceeded our guidance ranges and drove record-setting non-GAAP profitability measures across consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our modern, innovative solutions are resonating with customers and our disciplined operational management drove profitability margins to a record high. As we look ahead, we expect our industry leading solutions and unwavering focus to drive revenue growth and profitability in the second half of the fiscal year. Q2 consolidated gross margins of 72% were at an all-time high, driven by product gross margin of 61%, also at an all-time high. Gross margin leverage and the returns on our strategic investments drove record operating margins of 27% and record EPS of $1.58. During the quarter, we returned approximately $403 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing share count by 4% versus Q2 '23. Over the course of the year, we expect to return at least 100% of free cash flow to stockholders. Given our growth, profitability and working capital improvements, we expect operating cash flow for the full year to normalize and track relatively in-line with net income for the full year. Due to our solid execution and operational efficiencies, we outperformed the second quarter and expect our continued focus and discipline to deliver year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of the year. As a result, we are raising all our guidance measures for fiscal year '24. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q2 billings of $1.5 billion decreased 9% year-over-year, and revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 6% year-over-year, as IT budgets remain constrained in a challenging macro environment. Adjusting for the FX tailwind of 160-basis-points, billings and revenue would have decreased 11% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 7% year-over-year, and product revenue of $706 million decreased 16% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, the first half of fiscal year '23 revenue, and most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog entering fiscal year '23. For the second half of fiscal year '24 year-over-year comparisons should be more apples-to-apples. Support revenue, an attach to our install base and indicative of the value of our products, grew 3% year-over-year to $623 million. We are pleased with the momentum of our product portfolio and our go-to-market initiatives implemented at the start of fiscal year '24. Public Cloud revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $154 million and was relatively flat from Q1 '24. As George noted, year-over-year growth was driven by hyperscaler first party and marketplace services, partially offset by continued declines in subscription services. Now, for our operating results. Q2 consolidated gross margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 72% and product gross margin increased 1,080 basis points year-over-year to 61%. Product gross margin benefited from three main factors: Number one, a mix shift to higher margin and higher capacity products. Number two, favorable COGs stemming from lower component costs and our strategic purchase agreements for NAND. Number three, price discipline in a cost sensitive, competitive pricing environment. I want to be very clear on this point: there were no unusual or one-time transactions that drove the higher product gross margin results. As we discussed in prior calls, we continue to make strategic purchase commitments to lock-in NAND pricing and mitigate margin pressure from rising prices in the future, as NAND prices largely bottomed out in Q2. Operating expenses of $706 million were flat year-over-year and grew $3 million quarter-over-quarter. Within a relatively consistent OpEx envelope, we will continue to reallocate investments to areas of higher opportunity to drive long-term growth. In Q2 operating margin increased 320 basis points year-over-year to 27%, which includes 80 basis points of FX tailwind. EPS grew 7% year-over-year to $1.58, which includes a $0.07 FX tailwind. These record results demonstrate the strength of our business model, product relevance and unwavering focus and execution. As expected, Q2 operating cash flow of $135 million was impacted by seasonally lower collections and repatriation tax payments. DSO was 46 and inventory turns were 15. More importantly, year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million grew 19% year-over-year compared to a decline of 8% the same period a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $97 million, bringing the year-to-date amount to $515 million, up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $403 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $230 million in net cash. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q2 was $4 billion. The slight decline year-over-year is driven by lower multi-year support and public cloud subscription billings. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. Given the success of our product portfolio and consistent execution on operational improvements, we are raising our fiscal '24 guidance in still a soft IT spending environment. We now expect fiscal year '24 revenue to be down approximately 2% year-over-year, an improvement from our previous guidance. We expect to see continued strength in product and hyper-scaler first-party and marketplace services, as we work through minor headwinds from public cloud subscription services. Consolidated gross margins are expected to be approximately 71%. For the second half, we expect product gross margin to range between 58% to 60%, driven by continued mix shift to all-flash products and taking into account the current pricing environment and our commitment to maintain pricing flexibility. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 26% and EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25 with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $30 million and share count of 212 million. Operating cash flow is expected to move in-line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital. In Q3, we expect revenue to range between $1.51 billion and $1.67 billion, which at the midpoint implies an increase of 4% year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margins to be roughly 71%, and operating margin to be approximately 28%. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.74. In closing, I want to thank our customers, employees and investors once again for their steadfast commitment and investment in NetApp. I remain confident in our ability to manage the elements in our control and focus our key priorities to help customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud journeys. Our portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments, and we are committed to delivering sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Operator, we'll begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my question. Two quick follow-up. Given the updated fiscal year '24 revenue guide, should we assume that the July product revenue of $590 million was essentially the bottom and you would continue to see a sequential improvement in the second half? And the second question has to do with and momentum with some of these higher margin, higher capacity to product. To what extent should we assume these market share has enabled you to ride out a tough IT spend environment?\nGeorge Kurian: I'll take the second one, and then Mike can take the first, maybe. We feel very good about the momentum with our C-Series portfolio, we are able to serve customer workloads and use cases, particularly at time of soft IT spending where we are aligned to the value that we bring. And the software value of ONTAP is particularly useful in these all-flash configurations. We are also expanding the total addressable market with the all SAN Array configuration of the C-Series and of the high-performance flash products. So I'm excited about what the future holds for our flash business, and it is because of that momentum and the focus of our go-to-market that we've taken up our guide for the full year.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, Mehdi. On your question on product revenue, certainly for fiscal '24 implied in the guidance is continued growth in \u2013 or growth in the second half for the product line. Total revenue growth averages about 4% for the second half. We have not guided for fiscal '25 yet, but we certainly would -- we feel good about going into '25 as it relates to our product portfolio and our operational improvements.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks Mehdi. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Yes, ma'am. And our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. A couple of questions. Just one, realizing that you're saying there's no major contributor to the gross margin upside. But just how do you see NAND prices increasing, just an outlook on how you see gross margins developing throughout the year and whether these are sustainable? And then just as a second question, do you attribute the more confident in the year to the early success that you're having with C-Series? Do you attribute it to signs you're seeing coming out of INSIGHT? Just what gives you more confidence on the year just given the dampened environment? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Hi, Meta. This is Mike. I'll take the first one, and then George will take the second one. So the comment in the script was specifically related to no one-time transactions that drove the overachievement product margins. As we look forward through the rest of fiscal '24 and '25. And let's start with the second half of '24, we're currently guiding product gross margins between 58% and 60%. As we all know, we continue to benefit from the lowest component costs we've seen in many years. We have included some room in our guidance to be flexible in pricing as well as mix and capacity. And as we've all seen from the industry analyst reports, we do expect that component pricing has bottomed out in our Q2 and will rise as we go throughout the rest of '24. We do feel very good about our position for the rest of the fiscal year as it relates to purchase agreements that we have struck as well as prebuy. Similar to '24, we are looking to extend that into '25, and we'll continue to work with our suppliers as we go through the rest of the year. I'd also note that, hey, historically, we all know storage industry pricing evolves as component pricing changes, and we expect that trend to continue. So, all that being said, we feel good about the second half of '24, as we've included in our outlook. As we head into '25, we'll see how things progress as it relates to mix, pricing and component costs and will guide '25 when we get to our Q4 call. With that, I'll hand it to George.\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to your question on the underlying factors that support our optimism in the guide. First of all, from a macro perspective, it's still a challenged macro with the soft demand environment. We saw incremental improvement in North America, but equally a deceleration in certain parts of Europe, mirroring the economic landscape in the public domain. I think within the large enterprise, we see a case-by-case situation in terms of demand and we continue to see a more robust product business in this commercial or mid-market customer base. So, no real fundamental change in the demand environment. With regard to the two underlying factors for confidence. One is, we are a much more focused go-to-market organization, and we are seeing the second consecutive quarter of pipeline and performance from the changes we made at the start of the fiscal year. And so I want to credit our go-to-market teams for their focus and the results that they have delivered this quarter, and that is one of the key contributors. The second is the really strong performance of our all-flash portfolio. We talked in the prepared remarks about a large competitive win against a purely flash competitor. And we see that across multiple segments where we are seeing competitive wins with our portfolio. So those are the two fundamental reasons: go-to-market focus and execution and confidence in our portfolio.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Actually I have two questions for George. George, first one, kind of like what are the lead times for the storage products today? And what does that imply for your visibility when you look into calendar '24? And the second question is, curious whether on a storage content per customer, does it \u2013 have you seen any increase in it because of AI? Or do you think that will happen maybe at some point in the future? Or is there any way to put some time lines around it?\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to lead times, we are at normal lead times for our portfolio, and we reached those normal lead times a few quarters ago. With regard to the question on storage demand for AI, listen, I think we have been in the AI business for predictive AI or industrial AI for five years. And there are large data sets that are built out to support training of those models and the implementation of those models across the enterprise. So we have a good and robust business there. We are starting to see early signs of trials and use cases with generative AI. Generative AI is particularly well suited for NetApp's capabilities because it operates on unstructured data, files, documents, video, audio and so on. And so we have large repositories of those and customers, and we are able to use that data set and add to that data set to support AI use cases. This quarter, we won a large AI implementation at a very large U.S. bank that was really focused on generative AI document summarization analysis and so on, and we are the infrastructure foundation for that. So it will take time for generative AI to become a demand driver. We are seeing early positive signs there.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, George.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good afternoon. I had two questions on the product business. So first of all, I'm not fully understanding what you're saying about the pricing environment. At one point you said, you maintained disciplined pricing and then at another point you would be flexible going forward with pricing. So can you sort of give us a sense for how challenging or not challenging it is to hold pricing in these gross margins? And the second one is related to the product gross margins. I'm just still trying to get a sense for how sustainable this last quarter and the guidance for the next quarter is in terms of product gross margins, even if we adjust for the changes in NAND pricing? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, on pricing, we've been in this industry for a very long period of time. And while there will be people who are vendors who are aggressive in any particular transaction or other, depending on their own strategic reasons. Overall, we don't see fundamental changes in the pricing environment. Clearly, the room with lower component costs gives you an opportunity to do more in terms of pricing flexibility. But I think that our past quarter's gross margin results our demonstration of the fact that we've been able to maintain pricing discipline at a time where demand is soft, and it talks to both the differentiation of our product portfolio and the execution in our field teams. I'll have Mike talk a bit about your second question.\nMike Berry: Thanks, George. And I'll refer to George's comments, Steve, when I talk about the sustainability. So as -- so we finished at 61% product margins in Q2. We guided a range of 50% to 60% in the back half. We feel very good about our component costs and the view of that for the rest of our fiscal '24. The reason why we guided slightly lower than Q2 from a margin perspective, that's exactly what George talked about, which is we feel really good about our pricing discipline in our products but we want to make sure and leave room to be flexible should we need that in the second half. That's the one part of the equation that we don't control as much as the cost. So hopefully, that helps. We would not have guided that range if we didn't feel good about it for the second half, Steve.\nSteven Fox: Yes. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Asiya Merchant with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you. Maybe just a little bit on the macro. Clearly, you're executing really well. And should we -- should we expect slightly better than seasonal growth for you guys in the second half, just given the fact that you guys are ramping on a new product? And then just broadly on the macro, are we starting to see more adoption of flash across the customer base in general as people start to appreciate maybe more pricing being more attractive or is this something that was specific to NetApp just given the success that you're seeing in your C-Series? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I'll take the second, and Michael cover the first question. Thank you for the question. Listen, I think that with regard to customer adoption of flash-based technologies, they are -- we saw the high-performance landscape moved to flash several years ago, and there's been a steady movement of that footprint to flash. That is about 15% to 20% of the overall storage market, maybe 20%. The next tranche of use cases are more in the general purpose application footprint. These are in the process of migrating over multiple years. We are in the early innings of that migration. And so we feel very good about the position of our flash portfolio to attack that part of the market. It is essentially the 10K hard drive market that is about 30% to 40% of the hard drive market. So, you'll see that move over time. And so I'll let Mike talk to the first question you had.\nMike Berry: Sure. On your question, Asiya, as it relates to linearity, we did see a nice quarter-on-quarter pickup in Q2 which was really driven by the factors that George discussed. And look at the midpoint of guidance for the year, we do expect it to be relatively consistent with the numbers we like to talk about, which is the 48% in the first half and 52% in the second. Again, keep in mind that the good bit of our revenue, thankfully comes from support, very predictable. Hopefully, we can do a little better, but that is -- the midpoint of guidance is pretty much right on linearity.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. I was wondering, George, if you could comment a little bit on a public cloud revenue trajectory in fiscal '24, given some of the changes that you noted? And given those changes in CloudOps, how does that change your long-term revenue outlook for that business on a relative basis, I think before you were thinking 40% of total Public Cloud. Wondering where you're thinking that, that might shake out now in the long-term?\nGeorge Kurian: So, let me provide some baseline before I jump into the strategy review takeaways and the implications. First, cloud is roughly 10% of total revenue. Subscription is 23% of cloud revenue, down from about 35% a year ago. So, it's a small percentage of the total cloud revenue and an even smaller percentage of the total company revenue. The mix of Cloud Storage and CloudOps is still relatively consistent approximately 60/40. We focused our strategy review on all elements of our cloud portfolio and had five key takeaways that I outlined in my prepared comments. Sharpening the focus on first-party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services. These performed very well in the second quarter and continue to be uniquely differentiated both to end customers of our on-premises solution and a vehicle to acquire net new customers alongside our cloud partners. We would carefully manage the transition of some of the storage subscriptions to our consumption offering as we roll out [1P] services, customers that used to buy storage subscriptions prefer to now go towards the 1P offering, and we'll manage that carefully. We will integrate some standalone services like data protection and privacy into our cloud storage offerings so that they bring more value to the base offering. And we'll refocus other services like Cloud Insights, which are subscription services and Instaclustr to differentiate NetApp in the cloud storage workload motions that we are focused on. We've decided to exit some standalone services like Virtual Desktop and SaaS Backup services. And all of this will lead to about a $55 million ARR headwind from these actions in the second half of fiscal year '24. The reduction in Public Cloud subscription services will be partially offset by the good growth of our consumption cloud storage services in particular. And so our plans for the second half of the year assumes that we will have a modest decline in cloud revenue. We're not going to guide it but we assume that. And we have built that into the guidance for the fiscal year '24, which we took up by approximately $100 million. We're not going to comment today on the outlook for the overall cloud business. We will talk to you when we update our long-term models to that effect.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, George. And if I could, Mike, your margins were really, really strong, both sequentially and on an absolute basis. Wondering as we think about free cash flow margins, would all this EBIT margin improvement flow through into free cash flow margins? And secondarily, just on the EBIT margins, is there a way to dimension out of the three things that you noted, maybe rank order or order of magnitude so that we can get some sense around the confidence of sustainability, especially as it relates to commodity pricing, which you seem to indicate won't really matter too much sequentially. But just wondering what was the biggest sequential driver of that margin improvement? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Sure. So on two questions there. First of all, on cash flow, and I'll do operating cash flow. We do expect for the year, I talked about it in the prepared remarks, operating cash flow to move relatively consistently with non-GAAP net income. So to your question, yes, as the income increases associated operating cash flow, short of any quarterly fluctuations in working capital. So all good there in terms of free cash flow margins largely moving with operating cash flow. And then on the second question, and I'll answer this on a sequential basis, not a year-over-year basis. As we look from Q1 to Q2, certainly, the mix shift was a significant impact. We did receive some benefit on costs as those older inventories are now completely gone. And then, of course, pricing discipline is in there as well. So I would rank from a sequential perspective, the order that I did in my prepared remarks in terms of mix shift, which is both product and capacity than favorable COGS and then pricing discipline. So hopefully, that helps.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: Great. Thanks for taking my question. You guys mentioned 30% growth in first-party storage services. What's the NRR underlying that?\nGeorge Kurian: We don't break those out. I think we feel very good about -- we have brought in the number of workloads that we serve. We have brought in the number of hyperscalers now with Google coming online. We have brought lower price points for Azure and Google, and we have brought higher price points for Amazon. So I feel really, really good about the momentum in our first-party cloud storage services.\nNehal Chokshi: Maybe phrasing it in a different way, the driver of that growth is expansion or lands?\nGeorge Kurian: The combination of both new customer adds and add new workload use cases within existing customers as well as expansions.\nNehal Chokshi: Great. And then a follow-up, quick question. George, you talked about how you had a $16 million win with the C-Series. And you mentioned four drivers behind that. Much of those four drivers was really probably the biggest element of that win?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think we have a really strong operating system capability for performance and simplification at scale. Many of the other vendors that start simple run into real trouble when you try to build a large enterprise environment. And we have a really good portfolio to do that. I think that was probably the number one reason. And the number two reason is now that we have the C-Series, we have a price point to deliver to customers who used to not have it.\nNehal Chokshi: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, just a quick clarification. On the strategic review update, I just want to confirm, it sounds like you've concluded that review apart from sort of regular business kind of reviews. I just want to confirm that, that's the case. And then really, the element I'm trying to sort of tease out here is you've taken out $55 million of ARR, so roughly $15 million of revenue, yet your outlook is higher. What is informing the higher outlook? What's been the biggest surprise and the biggest delta contributing to the higher outlook? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: So first of all, let me hit that in three parts, right? First, we have concluded the strategic review. We have a set of good decisions we've made that we need to now go implement that will result in a more focused cloud business and a healthier subscription base, albeit a smaller one that build off. We believe that these actions should allow us to get back to growth in fiscal year '25 of a healthier business mix in cloud. We always will do reviews of various aspects of our portfolio as ongoing parts of our business. But the focused strategic review, I would say, is mostly complete. I think the second is with regard to the confidence we have. Listen, we said that when we guided the second half of the year, we took up the overall guide by close to $100 million. That is mostly based on the momentum of our all-flash Hybrid Cloud storage portfolio. We've raised the second half guide by substantially more than we beat in the second quarter. And it also accounts for the fact that we will have some headwinds through the rest of fiscal year '24 in our cloud subscription business, which will only be partially offset by growth in our cloud consumption business.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question then comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of those have been asked and answered. But I wanted to go back to some prior discussion around this notion of AI. And we hear a lot about like AI, large language models becoming smaller and implemented more maybe pervasively over time in traditional enterprise environments. We've even heard more about inferencing and how that might evolve in enterprises. I'm just curious, are you seeing at all any signs of that pulling either discussions or early signs of demand? And if so, is it a prerequisite that, that has to pull as all-flash storage with that kind of footprint. And the reason I ask is there's a lot of discussion about a lot of this existing infrastructure that's going to have to be upgraded to support these acceleration of AI in infrastructure? Sorry for the long-winded question.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. No problem. I'll address that in three steps. I think first is the use of smaller models as opposed to the very, very large model. Yes, that term is distillation. We do see that going on in customers, whereas they kind of run these different models, they begin to realize that you can get as effective an outcome with much faster results and a smaller number of parameters. For example, the demonstration, the live demonstration that we showed at NetApp INSIGHT actually was the distillation. We started with a much larger LLM and we brought it to a much smaller range of parameters because you get the same benefit. So that's going on. The second is with regard to training environment, which is the part of the data life cycle in AI where you aggregate a data set and you train the algorithm or the language model for better answers to be able to either predict a good outcome or generate a relevant outcome. You do need very high-performance storage because the GPUs that drive those algorithms need very, very fast parallel access to data. And with our unstructured data scale-out file system, we feel very well positioned for that. And then the third is with regard to inferencing, inferencing is the part of the data life cycle where you've taken a model and now you want to put it into production on our data set could be on a factory floor, could be in a distributed office. There it really depends on the data set and the use case what type of storage you need. You may need it for larger environments like shop floors, but you may not need super high-performance storage and compute for a very small office, like a claim\u2019s office, for example, in insurance.\nAaron Rakers: That's very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, real quickly, who is your predominant competitor that you see on the block optimized C-level all-flash arrays or C-Series arrays?\nGeorge Kurian: It's all -- the block market is a crowded market. We feel very good about our offerings in the mid-range, especially and the ability to offer a single solution with common automation, common administration, common life cycle management for both fire and block. And no other vendor in the market can do that. And so we feel very good. I think the large competitors are clearly Dell and HPE are in the mid-range and then you occasionally see some pure.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess if I start with the Public Cloud strategic review that you discussed, just wanted to clarify, based on the changes you're making there, are there any cost implications other changes? I'm assuming that allows you to focus your go-to-market a bit more, but is there any sort of cost implication where you're enabling some cost take out there? And secondly, Mike, you mentioned sort of the 58% to 60% gross margin on the product revenue in the second half. When we think about, sort of, prebuys that you might do going into fiscal '25, how should we think about the trajectory of the gross margin into fiscal '25. Any levers that you have to offset sort of the flow-through of that to the operating margin that you're really reporting at a very strong level right now? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: On the cost side, listen, I think we will, for the most part, just repurpose those resources to drive growth in our first-party cloud storage, we feel good about the demand environment there, and we want to continue to accelerate that. Whatever cost opportunities they are, it's been factored into the second half guidance that we gave you.\nMike Berry: Okay. And then thanks for the question, Samik. On the question, especially going into fiscal '25 from the product margin, I'll go over a little bit my answer to Meta when he asked the same question. So as we've all seen from the analyst reports, we have -- we do expect that NAND is largely bottomed. We're at the loss component pricing we've been at in a while. We did a really nice job and kudos to the supply chain team for doing the prebuys and purchase agreements for '24. We will certainly look at those and continue to look at those in '25, but it has to make sense for both NetApp and our suppliers. So as we go into '21, there are certainly some levers. The big question there, Samik that I don't have an answer to is what does the market do and pricing do over the next six months. That's why we're going to wait, will guide the margin number when we guide for the full year because we really want to get through the next couple of quarters to see how component pricing goes, what we expect the mix to be. And then what happens from a pricing environment perspective.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: On the cost side, listen, I think we will, for the most part, just repurpose those resources Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. \nAnanda Baruah: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, George, an inference related question, maybe two quick parts. Are you hearing any of your customers talk about legislation around inferencing, having an impact on their plans? And I guess, just generally speaking, any opinion you have on sort of what that ramp over what time period kind of looks like even. If just anecdotally would be helpful. I appreciate it. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. I think, first of all, we are in the stages of generated AI. Predictive AI is quite mature and has very strong use cases. We have done really well in health care and life sciences in manufacturing, in parts of financial services, lots of use cases, right? And so I think that's mature. It requires good data sets and good data management to make it have the right outcome. With Generative AI, there is obviously a lot of discussion on both regulation as well as judicious use of the technology, everything from fairness to epic to privacy to all kind cybersecurity, all of those things. And I think it will take time. Where we are with most clients today is proof of concepts, right? They are trying to put their data sets together, they are trying to learn what these models, will help them do. And there are some use cases which are really easy to see the benefits from software development. It's very easy to see the benefits from, the more advanced ones where some of these concerns exist. They basically customers move cautiously. So it will take time. These are multiyear use case developments. And so we feel good about where we are at the moment, and we're just realistic that will lead time to build momentum.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes. Thanks for the context. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nSidney Ho: Great. Apologize if you have already addressed this. On the macro level, are you seeing any major differences between demand from large enterprises, small leading businesses in federal. Any particular verticals you would point out that shows particular strength of weakness both on the Hybrid Cloud and the Public Cloud? Thanks\nGeorge Kurian: The demand picture is still soft and mixed. Overall, we saw some improvements in the U.S., offset by some weakness in Europe. Nothing is not in the public domain. With regard to the customer time, large enterprise is still soft. Tech, for example, tech and service provider spending has not really come back. It is really a customer-by-customer situation versus a broad industry situation. With regard to the demand picture in midsized enterprise, our mid-sized enterprise business performed more robustly and secularly better than our large enterprise business. Public sector continues to be a work in progress. We saw some of the impact of the budget negotiations result in softer budgets for certain agencies. Our business performed well, particularly in the civilian agencies.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thank you. \nKris Newton: Thank you, Sidney. I'm going to hand it back to George for some final comments.\nGeorge Kurian: In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their strong execution and operational discipline in Q2, which drove revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and record gross margin, operating margin and EPS. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions, helping customers operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unifying their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT sources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Innovation in our all-flash storage portfolio enables us to address a broader TAM and we continue to innovate and lead in Public Cloud storage services. Our go-to-market team is laser- focused on these positions of strength, enabling us to deliver strong results in the challenged macro landscape. Looking ahead, I'm confident that the momentum we saw in Q2 will continue through the remainder of fiscal year '24. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a very solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging macro environment with soft IT spend. Our relentless focus and consistent execution delivered results that met and exceeded our guidance ranges and drove record-setting non-GAAP profitability measures across consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our modern, innovative solutions are resonating with customers and our disciplined operational management drove profitability margins to a record high. As we look ahead, we expect our industry leading solutions and unwavering focus to drive revenue growth and profitability in the second half of the fiscal year. Q2 consolidated gross margins of 72% were at an all-time high, driven by product gross margin of 61%, also at an all-time high. Gross margin leverage and the returns on our strategic investments drove record operating margins of 27% and record EPS of $1.58. During the quarter, we returned approximately $403 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing share count by 4% versus Q2 '23. Over the course of the year, we expect to return at least 100% of free cash flow to stockholders. Given our growth, profitability and working capital improvements, we expect operating cash flow for the full year to normalize and track relatively in-line with net income for the full year. Due to our solid execution and operational efficiencies, we outperformed the second quarter and expect our continued focus and discipline to deliver year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of the year. As a result, we are raising all our guidance measures for fiscal year '24. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q2 billings of $1.5 billion decreased 9% year-over-year, and revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 6% year-over-year, as IT budgets remain constrained in a challenging macro environment. Adjusting for the FX tailwind of 160-basis-points, billings and revenue would have decreased 11% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 7% year-over-year, and product revenue of $706 million decreased 16% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, the first half of fiscal year '23 revenue, and most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog entering fiscal year '23. For the second half of fiscal year '24 year-over-year comparisons should be more apples-to-apples. Support revenue, an attach to our install base and indicative of the value of our products, grew 3% year-over-year to $623 million. We are pleased with the momentum of our product portfolio and our go-to-market initiatives implemented at the start of fiscal year '24. Public Cloud revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $154 million and was relatively flat from Q1 '24. As George noted, year-over-year growth was driven by hyperscaler first party and marketplace services, partially offset by continued declines in subscription services. Now, for our operating results. Q2 consolidated gross margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 72% and product gross margin increased 1,080 basis points year-over-year to 61%. Product gross margin benefited from three main factors: Number one, a mix shift to higher margin and higher capacity products. Number two, favorable COGs stemming from lower component costs and our strategic purchase agreements for NAND. Number three, price discipline in a cost sensitive, competitive pricing environment. I want to be very clear on this point: there were no unusual or one-time transactions that drove the higher product gross margin results. As we discussed in prior calls, we continue to make strategic purchase commitments to lock-in NAND pricing and mitigate margin pressure from rising prices in the future, as NAND prices largely bottomed out in Q2. Operating expenses of $706 million were flat year-over-year and grew $3 million quarter-over-quarter. Within a relatively consistent OpEx envelope, we will continue to reallocate investments to areas of higher opportunity to drive long-term growth. In Q2 operating margin increased 320 basis points year-over-year to 27%, which includes 80 basis points of FX tailwind. EPS grew 7% year-over-year to $1.58, which includes a $0.07 FX tailwind. These record results demonstrate the strength of our business model, product relevance and unwavering focus and execution. As expected, Q2 operating cash flow of $135 million was impacted by seasonally lower collections and repatriation tax payments. DSO was 46 and inventory turns were 15. More importantly, year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million grew 19% year-over-year compared to a decline of 8% the same period a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $97 million, bringing the year-to-date amount to $515 million, up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $403 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $230 million in net cash. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q2 was $4 billion. The slight decline year-over-year is driven by lower multi-year support and public cloud subscription billings. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. Given the success of our product portfolio and consistent execution on operational improvements, we are raising our fiscal '24 guidance in still a soft IT spending environment. We now expect fiscal year '24 revenue to be down approximately 2% year-over-year, an improvement from our previous guidance. We expect to see continued strength in product and hyper-scaler first-party and marketplace services, as we work through minor headwinds from public cloud subscription services. Consolidated gross margins are expected to be approximately 71%. For the second half, we expect product gross margin to range between 58% to 60%, driven by continued mix shift to all-flash products and taking into account the current pricing environment and our commitment to maintain pricing flexibility. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 26% and EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25 with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $30 million and share count of 212 million. Operating cash flow is expected to move in-line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital. In Q3, we expect revenue to range between $1.51 billion and $1.67 billion, which at the midpoint implies an increase of 4% year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margins to be roughly 71%, and operating margin to be approximately 28%. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.74. In closing, I want to thank our customers, employees and investors once again for their steadfast commitment and investment in NetApp. I remain confident in our ability to manage the elements in our control and focus our key priorities to help customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud journeys. Our portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments, and we are committed to delivering sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris? Thank you, George. Good afternoon, Mehdi. On your question on product revenue, certainly for fiscal '24 implied in the guidance is continued growth in \u2013 or growth in the second half for the product line. Total revenue growth averages about 4% for the second half. We have not guided for fiscal '25 yet, but we certainly would -- we feel good about going into '25 as it relates to our product portfolio and our operational improvements. Hi, Meta. This is Mike. I'll take the first one, and then George will take the second one. So the comment in the script was specifically related to no one-time transactions that drove the overachievement product margins. As we look forward through the rest of fiscal '24 and '25. And let's start with the second half of '24, we're currently guiding product gross margins between 58% and 60%. As we all know, we continue to benefit from the lowest component costs we've seen in many years. We have included some room in our guidance to be flexible in pricing as well as mix and capacity. And as we've all seen from the industry analyst reports, we do expect that component pricing has bottomed out in our Q2 and will rise as we go throughout the rest of '24. We do feel very good about our position for the rest of the fiscal year as it relates to purchase agreements that we have struck as well as prebuy. Similar to '24, we are looking to extend that into '25, and we'll continue to work with our suppliers as we go through the rest of the year. I'd also note that, hey, historically, we all know storage industry pricing evolves as component pricing changes, and we expect that trend to continue. So, all that being said, we feel good about the second half of '24, as we've included in our outlook. As we head into '25, we'll see how things progress as it relates to mix, pricing and component costs and will guide '25 when we get to our Q4 call. With that, I'll hand it to George. Thanks, George. And I'll refer to George's comments, Steve, when I talk about the sustainability. So as -- so we finished at 61% product margins in Q2. We guided a range of 50% to 60% in the back half. We feel very good about our component costs and the view of that for the rest of our fiscal '24. The reason why we guided slightly lower than Q2 from a margin perspective, that's exactly what George talked about, which is we feel really good about our pricing discipline in our products but we want to make sure and leave room to be flexible should we need that in the second half. That's the one part of the equation that we don't control as much as the cost. So hopefully, that helps. We would not have guided that range if we didn't feel good about it for the second half, Steve. Sure. On your question, Asiya, as it relates to linearity, we did see a nice quarter-on-quarter pickup in Q2 which was really driven by the factors that George discussed. And look at the midpoint of guidance for the year, we do expect it to be relatively consistent with the numbers we like to talk about, which is the 48% in the first half and 52% in the second. Again, keep in mind that the good bit of our revenue, thankfully comes from support, very predictable. Hopefully, we can do a little better, but that is -- the midpoint of guidance is pretty much right on linearity. Thank you. Sure. So on two questions there. First of all, on cash flow, and I'll do operating cash flow. We do expect for the year, I talked about it in the prepared remarks, operating cash flow to move relatively consistently with non-GAAP net income. So to your question, yes, as the income increases associated operating cash flow, short of any quarterly fluctuations in working capital. So all good there in terms of free cash flow margins largely moving with operating cash flow. And then on the second question, and I'll answer this on a sequential basis, not a year-over-year basis. As we look from Q1 to Q2, certainly, the mix shift was a significant impact. We did receive some benefit on costs as those older inventories are now completely gone. And then, of course, pricing discipline is in there as well. So I would rank from a sequential perspective, the order that I did in my prepared remarks in terms of mix shift, which is both product and capacity than favorable COGS and then pricing discipline. So hopefully, that helps. Okay. And then thanks for the question, Samik. On the question, especially going into fiscal '25 from the product margin, I'll go over a little bit my answer to Meta when he asked the same question. So as we've all seen from the analyst reports, we have -- we do expect that NAND is largely bottomed. We're at the loss component pricing we've been at in a while. We did a really nice job and kudos to the supply chain team for doing the prebuys and purchase agreements for '24. We will certainly look at those and continue to look at those in '25, but it has to make sense for both NetApp and our suppliers. So as we go into '21, there are certainly some levers. The big question there, Samik that I don't have an answer to is what does the market do and pricing do over the next six months. That's why we're going to wait, will guide the margin number when we guide for the full year because we really want to get through the next couple of quarters to see how component pricing goes, what we expect the mix to be. And then what happens from a pricing environment perspective."

            "content": "Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Q2 improved on our solid start to FY 2024 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance while our operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. We remain relentlessly focused on managing the elements within our control while driving better performance in our storage business and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive results from these actions, with increased profitability and a stronger position for delivering long-term growth. In Q2, we held our INSIGHT user conference where I witnessed the tangible excitement for the silo-free innovation, our unified data storage provides. It was invigorating to be with the thousands of attendees and hear stories of the extraordinary outcomes NetApp delivers for our customers. NetApp is at the forefront of the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers turn disruption into opportunity with intelligent data infrastructure. Today's organizations need storage infrastructure that harnesses the power of public and hybrid clouds while keeping data secure and protected from ransomware attacks. They need infrastructure that supports dynamic workloads like AI, cloud-native, and open-source applications. And they need infrastructure that helps to create more sustainable data centers. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, that supports any application, any data type, and spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments. This comprehensive architecture delivers unparalleled simplicity of management, simplicity of deployment, and consistency of automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. We further elevate the customer experience with our BlueXP sustainability dashboard and NetApp Advance a common set of programs and guarantees that include Storage Life Cycle program, which removes the burden of upgrade cycles as well as storage efficiency, ransomware recovery and data availability guarantees. Intelligent data infrastructure combines unified data storage, integrated data services, and intelligent operations, so customers can operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unify their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Looking at the results of the quarter, momentum from new products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year drove 10% quarter-over-quarter growth in hybrid cloud segment revenue to $1.4 billion. Our all-flash array business benefited from the growth of the AFF C-Series increasing 14% from Q1 to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.2 billion. The AFF C-Series all-flash array continues to exceed our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. In the quarter, we successfully competed against an all-flash competitor with C-Series to win a $16 million deal at an Infrastructure-as-a-Service company. The customer was looking for new storage to host a broad variety of critical applications. Our ease of management for large storage environments, unique data resilience, common toolkit across all our storage systems and the right price performance ratio secured our win despite the competitor's attempt to use price once they realize their value proposition was insufficient. ONTAP One, our all-in-one software license that gives customers access to the industry's most comprehensive data management suite has laid the groundwork to future tech refresh and expansion opportunities. Building on the success of the C-Series, we introduced blocked optimized and AI-ready visions. The ASA C-Series family is a solution tailored to deliver high-performance and guaranteed high availability storage for critical applications, databases and VMware infrastructure, coupled with capacity flash to make enterprise-grade block storage more affordable and sustainable than ever. We added the AFF C-Series to the ONTAP AI architecture, lowering the overall cost of entry to scalable AI without sacrificing performance. Keystone, our Storage as a Service offering is also growing rapidly. In Q2, we added performance and availability guarantees to Keystone, expanding on the existing sustainability and storage efficiency guarantees, creating a comprehensive program to keep storage operations running optimally. We also announced NetApp storage on Equinix Metal, powered by Keystone, providing customers with a single subscription to a full stack of compute, networking and storage infrastructure with low-latency interconnection to all major public clouds. Turning to Public Cloud. As we said last quarter, our priority is growing first party cloud storage services. We aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners' go-to-market structures at the start of the fiscal year and are seeing new customer additions and growth in those services. However, that growth has been masked by weakness in subscription services, which have declined to 23% of Public Cloud ARR. During the quarter, we engaged in a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio. As a result, we will continue to prioritize cloud storage offerings delivered through the hyperscalers, while refocusing some services, such as Cloud Insights and Instaclustr, to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings, creating greater differentiation and additional value for customers. We will integrate other services that are sold as standalone subscriptions today, such as data protection, into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes. We will also carefully manage the transition of cloud storage subscription services to align to customer preference for consumption offerings. And, we have decided to exit the SaaS backup and virtual desktop services. We anticipate ARR headwinds of approximately $55 million from exited services and unrenewed subscriptions in the second half of fiscal year '24. Growth in first party and marketplace services are expected to partially offset this decline, positioning us to enter FY '25 with a more focused and much healthier business from which to grow. Now to the results of the quarter. Public Cloud segment revenue in Q2 was $154 million, flat from Q1 and up 8% year-over-year. Our first party and marketplace offerings are highly differentiated and are tightly aligned with customers' buying preferences. These services grew over 30% from Q2 a year ago. We continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as increases in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR in this part of the portfolio. In Q2, we extended our partnership with Google with the introduction of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. Now, we are not only the only vendor to have a natively integrated storage service in the public cloud, but we are natively integrated into all three of the leading hyperscale vendors. And we are not standing still with this advantage. Just two months after introducing the GCNV service, we announced the availability of a new lower-cost tier of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, expanding the offering to address a greater range of workloads. These partnerships uniquely position and enable us to participate in the innovation and adoption of AI services in the public cloud. As examples, during Q2, we announced support for Google Cloud's Vertex AI with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, as well as cross-protocol, hybrid cloud AI pipelines on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with support for SageMaker Studio notebooks. Our position with the hyperscalers also enables us to displace legacy on-premises competitors as customers migrate workloads to the cloud. A U.S.-based medical equipment company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to replace a competitor's SAN systems when they moved their database workloads to the cloud. This is the customer's first engagement with NetApp. Following a successful initial deployment, they are evaluating FSxN for workload consolidation and disaster recovery. Looking forward, our focus is clear and is delivering results. We expect the momentum we saw in Q2 to continue through FY '24, despite continued softness in the demand environment due to the challenging macro. Customers value our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure, and data management which enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely, and sustainably. With recent innovations that enable us to address a broader set of markets more efficiently, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. I'll take the second one, and then Mike can take the first, maybe. We feel very good about the momentum with our C-Series portfolio, we are able to serve customer workloads and use cases, particularly at time of soft IT spending where we are aligned to the value that we bring. And the software value of ONTAP is particularly useful in these all-flash configurations. We are also expanding the total addressable market with the all SAN Array configuration of the C-Series and of the high-performance flash products. So I'm excited about what the future holds for our flash business, and it is because of that momentum and the focus of our go-to-market that we've taken up our guide for the full year. With regard to your question on the underlying factors that support our optimism in the guide. First of all, from a macro perspective, it's still a challenged macro with the soft demand environment. We saw incremental improvement in North America, but equally a deceleration in certain parts of Europe, mirroring the economic landscape in the public domain. I think within the large enterprise, we see a case-by-case situation in terms of demand and we continue to see a more robust product business in this commercial or mid-market customer base. So, no real fundamental change in the demand environment. With regard to the two underlying factors for confidence. One is, we are a much more focused go-to-market organization, and we are seeing the second consecutive quarter of pipeline and performance from the changes we made at the start of the fiscal year. And so I want to credit our go-to-market teams for their focus and the results that they have delivered this quarter, and that is one of the key contributors. The second is the really strong performance of our all-flash portfolio. We talked in the prepared remarks about a large competitive win against a purely flash competitor. And we see that across multiple segments where we are seeing competitive wins with our portfolio. So those are the two fundamental reasons: go-to-market focus and execution and confidence in our portfolio. With regard to lead times, we are at normal lead times for our portfolio, and we reached those normal lead times a few quarters ago. With regard to the question on storage demand for AI, listen, I think we have been in the AI business for predictive AI or industrial AI for five years. And there are large data sets that are built out to support training of those models and the implementation of those models across the enterprise. So we have a good and robust business there. We are starting to see early signs of trials and use cases with generative AI. Generative AI is particularly well suited for NetApp's capabilities because it operates on unstructured data, files, documents, video, audio and so on. And so we have large repositories of those and customers, and we are able to use that data set and add to that data set to support AI use cases. This quarter, we won a large AI implementation at a very large U.S. bank that was really focused on generative AI document summarization analysis and so on, and we are the infrastructure foundation for that. So it will take time for generative AI to become a demand driver. We are seeing early positive signs there. Listen, on pricing, we've been in this industry for a very long period of time. And while there will be people who are vendors who are aggressive in any particular transaction or other, depending on their own strategic reasons. Overall, we don't see fundamental changes in the pricing environment. Clearly, the room with lower component costs gives you an opportunity to do more in terms of pricing flexibility. But I think that our past quarter's gross margin results our demonstration of the fact that we've been able to maintain pricing discipline at a time where demand is soft, and it talks to both the differentiation of our product portfolio and the execution in our field teams. I'll have Mike talk a bit about your second question. I'll take the second, and Michael cover the first question. Thank you for the question. Listen, I think that with regard to customer adoption of flash-based technologies, they are -- we saw the high-performance landscape moved to flash several years ago, and there's been a steady movement of that footprint to flash. That is about 15% to 20% of the overall storage market, maybe 20%. The next tranche of use cases are more in the general purpose application footprint. These are in the process of migrating over multiple years. We are in the early innings of that migration. And so we feel very good about the position of our flash portfolio to attack that part of the market. It is essentially the 10K hard drive market that is about 30% to 40% of the hard drive market. So, you'll see that move over time. And so I'll let Mike talk to the first question you had. So, let me provide some baseline before I jump into the strategy review takeaways and the implications. First, cloud is roughly 10% of total revenue. Subscription is 23% of cloud revenue, down from about 35% a year ago. So, it's a small percentage of the total cloud revenue and an even smaller percentage of the total company revenue. The mix of Cloud Storage and CloudOps is still relatively consistent approximately 60/40. We focused our strategy review on all elements of our cloud portfolio and had five key takeaways that I outlined in my prepared comments. Sharpening the focus on first-party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services. These performed very well in the second quarter and continue to be uniquely differentiated both to end customers of our on-premises solution and a vehicle to acquire net new customers alongside our cloud partners. We would carefully manage the transition of some of the storage subscriptions to our consumption offering as we roll out [1P] services, customers that used to buy storage subscriptions prefer to now go towards the 1P offering, and we'll manage that carefully. We will integrate some standalone services like data protection and privacy into our cloud storage offerings so that they bring more value to the base offering. And we'll refocus other services like Cloud Insights, which are subscription services and Instaclustr to differentiate NetApp in the cloud storage workload motions that we are focused on. We've decided to exit some standalone services like Virtual Desktop and SaaS Backup services. And all of this will lead to about a $55 million ARR headwind from these actions in the second half of fiscal year '24. The reduction in Public Cloud subscription services will be partially offset by the good growth of our consumption cloud storage services in particular. And so our plans for the second half of the year assumes that we will have a modest decline in cloud revenue. We're not going to guide it but we assume that. And we have built that into the guidance for the fiscal year '24, which we took up by approximately $100 million. We're not going to comment today on the outlook for the overall cloud business. We will talk to you when we update our long-term models to that effect. We don't break those out. I think we feel very good about -- we have brought in the number of workloads that we serve. We have brought in the number of hyperscalers now with Google coming online. We have brought lower price points for Azure and Google, and we have brought higher price points for Amazon. So I feel really, really good about the momentum in our first-party cloud storage services. The combination of both new customer adds and add new workload use cases within existing customers as well as expansions. Listen, I think we have a really strong operating system capability for performance and simplification at scale. Many of the other vendors that start simple run into real trouble when you try to build a large enterprise environment. And we have a really good portfolio to do that. I think that was probably the number one reason. And the number two reason is now that we have the C-Series, we have a price point to deliver to customers who used to not have it. So first of all, let me hit that in three parts, right? First, we have concluded the strategic review. We have a set of good decisions we've made that we need to now go implement that will result in a more focused cloud business and a healthier subscription base, albeit a smaller one that build off. We believe that these actions should allow us to get back to growth in fiscal year '25 of a healthier business mix in cloud. We always will do reviews of various aspects of our portfolio as ongoing parts of our business. But the focused strategic review, I would say, is mostly complete. I think the second is with regard to the confidence we have. Listen, we said that when we guided the second half of the year, we took up the overall guide by close to $100 million. That is mostly based on the momentum of our all-flash Hybrid Cloud storage portfolio. We've raised the second half guide by substantially more than we beat in the second quarter. And it also accounts for the fact that we will have some headwinds through the rest of fiscal year '24 in our cloud subscription business, which will only be partially offset by growth in our cloud consumption business. Yes. No problem. I'll address that in three steps. I think first is the use of smaller models as opposed to the very, very large model. Yes, that term is distillation. We do see that going on in customers, whereas they kind of run these different models, they begin to realize that you can get as effective an outcome with much faster results and a smaller number of parameters. For example, the demonstration, the live demonstration that we showed at NetApp INSIGHT actually was the distillation. We started with a much larger LLM and we brought it to a much smaller range of parameters because you get the same benefit. So that's going on. The second is with regard to training environment, which is the part of the data life cycle in AI where you aggregate a data set and you train the algorithm or the language model for better answers to be able to either predict a good outcome or generate a relevant outcome. You do need very high-performance storage because the GPUs that drive those algorithms need very, very fast parallel access to data. And with our unstructured data scale-out file system, we feel very well positioned for that. And then the third is with regard to inferencing, inferencing is the part of the data life cycle where you've taken a model and now you want to put it into production on our data set could be on a factory floor, could be in a distributed office. There it really depends on the data set and the use case what type of storage you need. You may need it for larger environments like shop floors, but you may not need super high-performance storage and compute for a very small office, like a claim's office, for example, in insurance. It's all -- the block market is a crowded market. We feel very good about our offerings in the mid-range, especially and the ability to offer a single solution with common automation, common administration, common life cycle management for both fire and block. And no other vendor in the market can do that. And so we feel very good. I think the large competitors are clearly Dell and HPE are in the mid-range and then you occasionally see some pure. On the cost side, listen, I think we will, for the most part, just repurpose those resources to drive growth in our first-party cloud storage, we feel good about the demand environment there, and we want to continue to accelerate that. Whatever cost opportunities they are, it's been factored into the second half guidance that we gave you. On the cost side, listen, I think we will, for the most part, just repurpose those resources Thank you. Yes. I think, first of all, we are in the stages of generated AI. Predictive AI is quite mature and has very strong use cases. We have done really well in health care and life sciences in manufacturing, in parts of financial services, lots of use cases, right? And so I think that's mature. It requires good data sets and good data management to make it have the right outcome. With Generative AI, there is obviously a lot of discussion on both regulation as well as judicious use of the technology, everything from fairness to epic to privacy to all kind cybersecurity, all of those things. And I think it will take time. Where we are with most clients today is proof of concepts, right? They are trying to put their data sets together, they are trying to learn what these models, will help them do. And there are some use cases which are really easy to see the benefits from software development. It's very easy to see the benefits from, the more advanced ones where some of these concerns exist. They basically customers move cautiously. So it will take time. These are multiyear use case developments. And so we feel good about where we are at the moment, and we're just realistic that will lead time to build momentum. The demand picture is still soft and mixed. Overall, we saw some improvements in the U.S., offset by some weakness in Europe. Nothing is not in the public domain. With regard to the customer time, large enterprise is still soft. Tech, for example, tech and service provider spending has not really come back. It is really a customer-by-customer situation versus a broad industry situation. With regard to the demand picture in midsized enterprise, our mid-sized enterprise business performed more robustly and secularly better than our large enterprise business. Public sector continues to be a work in progress. We saw some of the impact of the budget negotiations result in softer budgets for certain agencies. Our business performed well, particularly in the civilian agencies. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their strong execution and operational discipline in Q2, which drove revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and record gross margin, operating margin and EPS. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions, helping customers operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unifying their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT sources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Innovation in our all-flash storage portfolio enables us to address a broader TAM and we continue to innovate and lead in Public Cloud storage services. Our go-to-market team is laser- focused on these positions of strength, enabling us to deliver strong results in the challenged macro landscape. Looking ahead, I'm confident that the momentum we saw in Q2 will continue through the remainder of fiscal year '24. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKris Newton: Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Q1 marks a solid start to FY '24 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance, while our operational discipline yielded operating margin and EPS above our guidance ranges. As I have outlined on previous calls, we are focused on: managing the elements within our control; reinvigorating efforts to drive better performance in our storage business; and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive early indicators from this plan to sharpen our execution, deliver growth, increase profitability, and further strengthen our position for long-term success. Looking at the results of the quarter, I am especially pleased with the reception to our recent product introductions. The AFF C-series has been the fastest ramping all-flash product launch in our history, with strong demand across all products in the family. Similarly, the AFF A150, our entry-level, high performance all-flash array, grew quickly in its first full quarter of shipping. Our Storage Lifecycle Program is also seeing good early uptake, driving longer-term commitments to NetApp as we help customers future-proof their environments with a world-class ownership experience. Building on this momentum, we introduced more storage innovation in Q1. We announced the ASA A-series, a family of SAN-specific all-flash arrays, supported by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees. These systems are the only all-SAN storage arrays with virtual machine and application-granular data protection mechanisms. Complementing our unified storage offerings, they enable us to expand on the tens of thousands of customers who already use NetApp for block storage today and drive share gains in the $18 billion SAN market. In addition to delivering on our innovation agenda, we have implemented the go-to-market changes we outlined on the Q4 call, focusing our enterprise sellers on the flash opportunity and building a dedicated model for cloud. In May, we held our annual sales kickoff meeting, the first time we've gathered the global team in person since the pandemic. Everyone was energized by the innovation we're bringing to market and the objectives appropriately aligned to each team's strengths. Because many of the products we've introduced open new TAM for us, we are also including training to sharpen our attack on these opportunities. The changes have been well received, are already showing up in pipeline expansion, and should help drive top line growth in the second-half. Q1 Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.3 billion was down 12% year-over-year. Our all-flash array business decreased 7% from Q1 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. The demand environment is unchanged from the last half of FY '23, with headwinds from enterprise continuing to weigh on product and AFA revenue. Additionally, as Mike will outline, the first-half of fiscal year '23 benefited from elevated backlog, impacting the year-over-year comparisons. In the past few quarters, every conversation I've had with customers and investors has touched on artificial intelligence. Generative AI is top of mind for everyone. While still in the early innings of this opportunity, AI is not a new topic for us. We have been a leader in storage for predictive AI and machine learning workloads since we introduced ONTAP AI, a joint NetApp and NVIDIA-proven architecture, in 2018. Today, hundreds of customers rely on NetApp's storage infrastructure and data management for their AI workloads, including some of the largest pharmaceutical, financial services and retail companies in the world. Effective predictive and generative AI projects depend on high quality, well-managed, unstructured data. The data pipeline and workflow typically involve data from multiple file and object sources across cloud and on premises. High performance, highly scalable hybrid cloud storage and data management is a core NetApp advantage and naturally positions us as a leader in this market and will continue to benefit us as the Gen AI market evolves. While early, we are already engaged with customers who are interested in fine-tuning large language models with their own data on-premises, as well as those who are leveraging the hyperscalers' Gen AI offerings on the public cloud together with the storage and data management capabilities of NetApp Cloud Volumes services. Accelerated by the rise of AI, data continues to grow in both volume and value. A company's data is its most valuable asset. Our robust cyber resilience portfolio helps customers ensure that they have the right enterprise data protection and security on-premises and in the cloud. With built-in features that protect and secure data and deliver rapid recovery based on AI and machine learning, our systems can proactively spot and counter malicious or anomalous actions. Our confidence in our industry-leading capabilities is underscored by the ransomware recovery guarantee we announced in Q1 and demonstrated by the fact that NetApp is the only enterprise storage vendor on the NSA's classified program components list. Now, turning to Public Cloud. I want to acknowledge our cloud results have not been where we want them to be and assure you we are taking definitive actions to hone our approach and get back on track. At the start of this year, we aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners' go-to-market structures. Additionally, we are in the process of a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio, expand on the success of first party services and improve subscription performance. We will have more details to share with you on our next call. That said, Public Cloud segment revenue in Q1 was $154 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Public Cloud DBNRR declined to 107%. Within these numbers, strength in first party and marketplace consumption services was masked by weakness in our subscription services. Let me emphasize that our strategic focus is on first party cloud storage services, and we continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as revenue and ARR growth in this part of the portfolio. Our expectations for FY '24 Public Cloud revenue are reflected in the guidance Mike will walk you through. First party storage services, branded and sold by our cloud partners, position us uniquely and represent our biggest opportunity. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and delivering growth. Our close and long-standing relationship with Microsoft Azure continues to deliver solid growth. Likewise, our partnership with Google remains strong. And in the coming weeks, you can expect to hear exciting news about the expansion of our partnership. Our relationship with AWS is also yielding positive results. As expected, we are starting to win large enterprise deployments with FSx for NetApp ONTAP. We were chosen to be the cloud storage infrastructure for a global sportswear manufacturer's SAP HANA deployment. FSxN was the only storage service that could meet the company's mission-critical service level, availability, and recovery requirements. This is a large, long-term SAP project that will continue to develop and grow over the coming years, driving significant consumption of FSxN capacity. Once completed, it will be one of the largest SAP environments on AWS. In the face of the challenging macro, demand remains muted, and sales cycles remain elongated. Although customers continue to exhibit caution, they are moving forward with strategic initiatives, prioritizing investments in applications and technologies that drive business productivity and growth. Our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure and data management enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely and sustainably. Customers turn to NetApp to help them increase the performance and reliability of their digital and cloud transformational projects. Looking forward, our priorities are clear. We will continue to tightly manage the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in the storage business, and continue to refine our Public Cloud business. Early results indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth year-over-year while yielding top-line growth in the back half of fiscal year '24. Before turning the call over to Mike, I want to thank the NetApp team for their continued focus. I also want to remind you we'll be hosting our INSIGHT user conference in person in Las Vegas this October. We hope to see you there.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed a solid quarter in a challenging macro environment, hitting or exceeding all our guidance ranges. We are delivering on our commitments, evident in our solid Q1 results. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our disciplined operational management and the strong customer acceptance of our innovation continues to pay off. We expect improved execution and new products will drive growth and operating margin expansion as we move through the second-half of the year. As expected, Q1 consolidated gross margin was strong. Product margin came in at 55%. Given our expectations for competitive dynamics and product mix, we remain confident in our projection that product margin will hold at these levels through the remainder of the fiscal year. Cash from operations was a first quarter all-time high. Operating cash flow benefited from the reduction of premiums, as well as lower component pricing and incentive compensation payouts. Over the course of fiscal year \u201824, cash flow should normalize, with operating cash flow tracking relatively in line with non-GAAP net income. We returned approximately 120% of free cash flow to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing Q1 fiscal \u201824 share count by almost 4% year-over-year. As we discussed during last quarter's call, we intend to return 100% of free cash flow this year. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q1 billings of $1.3 billion decreased 17% year-over-year. Revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 10% year-over-year. The challenging macro environment continued to pressure IT spending. However, as George pointed out, we are well aligned to customers' priority investments and remain confident our go-to-market changes and product innovations will drive growth in the second-half of fiscal year \u201824. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.3 billion was down 12% year-over-year. Product revenue of $590 million was down 25%. Remember that first-half fiscal year 2023 revenue, most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. Support revenue of $611 million grew 2% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR grew 6% year-over-year to $619 million. Public Cloud revenue of $154 million increased 17% from Q1 a year ago. First party and marketplace services grew as customers continue to choose solutions based on NetApp technology for mission-critical and cloud native workloads. This growth was offset by underperformance in subscription services. As George noted earlier, Public Cloud did not meet our expectations for the quarter, and we are taking action to hone our approach and reaccelerate growth. Q1 consolidated gross margin of 71% came in above our guidance, up 400 basis points from a year ago, and again reaching an all-time company high. Product gross margin was 55%, in line with expectations. As we discussed on the Q4 call, we made strategic purchase commitments to lock-in record low NAND pricing and mitigate rising prices in the future. NAND prices continued to decline in Q1, and we are still positioned favorably versus the market. The potential for increased price competition is factored into our expectations and we remain confident in our ability to hold product gross margin consistent at this level through the year. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margin of 92%. Public cloud gross margin improved to 67% from 66% last quarter. As expected, operating expenses of $703 million were flat year-over-year and grew 4% from Q4'23. The sequential increase was driven by annual merit increases and a reset of incentive compensation, as well as expenses related to our in-person sales kick-off meeting. Q1 again highlighted the strength of our business model and disciplined operational execution with operating margin of 22%, ahead of expectations. EPS of $1.15 was also above the high end of our guidance. Operating cash flow was $453 million in Q1, an increase of 61% year-over-year, driven by lower supply chain payments and variable compensation, partially offset by lower collections. In Q1, DSO decreased to 41 and inventory turns improved to 13. Free cash flow increased 94% year-over-year to $418 million, helped by strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. During the quarter, we returned $506 million to stockholders through shares repurchased and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $600 million in net cash. We have approximately $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q1 was $4.2 billion, up slightly from a year ago. We ended the quarter with approximately $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for the full-year. Our total revenue guide is unchanged, with revenue down low to mid-single-digits year-over-year, measured on a percentage basis. Based on our Q1 results and updated projections, we expect Public Cloud revenue growth to come in lower than initially expected primarily due to softness in our subscription services. This minor weakness is expected to be at least offset by strength in our Hybrid Cloud revenue. We continue to expect fiscal year '24 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, operating margin to be approximately 25%, and EPS to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.85. We expect Q2 revenue to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a decline of 8% year-over-year. If FX rates stay at end-of-July levels, we would see nearly 2 points of FX tailwinds to revenue. As I called out earlier, first-half fiscal year \u201823 revenue benefited from elevated levels of backlog due to last year\u2019s supply chain constraints, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, and operating margin to be approximately 24%. EPS should be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. In closing, I want to thank our employees, customers and investors for their commitment and investment in NetApp. I am confident in our ability to help our customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud transformation goals. We are well aligned to priority IT investments and are committed to deliver sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q & A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thanks for doing the call. So last quarter, you guys talked about spending for large enterprises were cautious, where obviously you guys are overexposed. That doesn't seem like that has changed that much. From your conversation with customers, do you have a sense when demand could start picking up, maybe based on utilization data or whatnot? First, just give us some historical context at what utilization rate level do you start seeing demand pick up, and do you think that will be quite any different this cycle? I mean, while you\u2019re at it talk about the trends in small and medium businesses as well? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Overall -- thank you for the question. Overall, the spending environment this past quarter was unchanged from what we saw in the second half of the prior fiscal year. Our mid-sized enterprise business across the globe and public sector did better than large enterprise. Within large enterprise, as we noted, the same verticals remained cautious in spending, service provider, high-tech and, to a lesser extent, financial services. With regard to their spending criterion, they are spending on strategic projects but are running infrastructure, broadly speaking, hotter than meaning at higher levels of utilization than they typically do and what we typically tell them is best practice. That is common in such macro environments, but it's not a long-term trend. I think we expect them as we progress through the fiscal year for them to start to expand investment because they cannot run systems that hard. As we noted in our prepared remarks and in prior calls, we do not expect the macro to change substantially to support our guidance for the year. Our guidance for the year reflects our confidence both in the changes that we made in go-to-market as well as in our product portfolio that we recently introduced.\nSidney Ho: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick follow-ups. George, I want to go back to the big picture and revisit the topic of repatriation. How do you see generative AI strengthening this argument that there will be repatriation enterprises have better ownership of the data that, that would actually help with a faster adoption? Is there any update? Is there any feedback from the -- your conversation from your enterprise customers that you can share? And a quick follow-up. Can you provide a mix of a QLC NAND that you're procuring? And how do you see that changing towards the end of the calendar year?\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to Gen AI projects, which we are already engaged in, in a number of customers, we see a mix of use cases. I would say there are three common patterns. One is unstructured data. The second is the need for consistent data management, both security and privacy are hot topics as well as the lineage of data so that they can keep track of which version of Gen AI model is the best and most accurate. And then the third is from a deployment architecture, we are seeing them engage in both on-prem discussions, as well as public cloud discussions. In public cloud, the advantages are much faster feature velocity, as well as prepackaged models available on the public cloud. With the on-prem environments, the major sensitivity is the data being kept in a restricted location. So we intend to benefit from both. I don't think that it is a meaningful driver of repatriation at this point in the discussion maybe. There we're seeing a mix of public cloud and on-prem environments.\nMike Berry: And then, hey, Mehdi, it's Mike. On the QLC, we're not going to break-out specific numbers, but we would say we are procuring more of that. We started to see the pickup. We'll see how the rest of the year goes, but we do expect that to continue as a percentage as we go through fiscal '24.\nMehdi Hosseini: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Cardoso: Hey, thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Just one question from me. You reported a strong gross margin performance in the quarter and I was just curious if you could quantify how much of the improvement were is it related to premium? The premium benefits, strategic purchases, et-cetera, that you've highlighted and how we should think about that tailwind as we progress through this year, including and excluding the expected price competition that you have embedded into the guide? And then just real quickly, a clarification on that last part, like are you guys actually seeing price competition currently from your competitors? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Hey Joe, it's Mike. So, on your question, we've talked a lot about premiums and as we talked about last-time, we're super-excited and not have to talk about them anymore. So largely in Q1, all of those premiums have I would say gone away, not only from a P&L perspective, but cash. We talked about that number was anywhere typically between, call it, $30 million and $40 million a quarter, sometimes it bumped up to $50 million, so call it an average of about $40 million. That -- we got a good bit of that. We did not have to accrue in Q4 and then the rest hold to Q1. So it's 55% last quarter, 55% this quarter. And now premiums are fully out-of-the number. So as you look-forward, it's one of the reasons why we feel confident in the 55% guide. There -- hey, there has always been price competition. We see it in certain geographies or certain customers. We haven't seen any material change to that in our guide. We do expect that we will be -- we will need to be, call it, marginally more aggressive in certain situations, but certainly nothing significantly different than we are today.\nJoseph Cardoso: Thanks for the color.\nMike Berry: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Tsvetanov: Yes, thank you, guys. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. I wanted to ask, your ARR in the quarter -- your ARR growth in the quarter slowed quite a bit. And I know you guys have pushed out your $2 billion sort of target, but I just wanted to take a step-back and I think about like to your first billion, what -- how would you describe the trajectory to getting there and maybe timing? If you can kind of just help us think about where we go from here? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes, I think first of all, our -- we have two models in which we serve customers; the consumption model, which is essentially a pay-as-you-go utility model; and then a subscription model, which is where the customer pays for a certain amount of capacity or managed units or capability and then renews that on an annual basis or a term basis. Then consumption part of our business has grown to about three quarters of our total business, roughly speaking. Of our cloud business, subscription is the quarter. And if you look at the last quarter's performance, the cloud storage and consumption businesses continue to perform well. They grew year-on-year. Their dollar-based net retention rate was at the industry average, industry norms. Subscription is where we saw a challenge, both a small part of cloud storage subscription as well as CloudOps and we are conducting a review and we'll get you an update at the next quarterly call about our plans for that part of our business.\nMichael Tsvetanov: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And if I can just add one more. I just want to understand your all-flash business is down about 7%. And I can appreciate the macro backdrop there, but I'm wondering if you can just help me understand the share kind of trends? And maybe your best estimate where that's been this quarter? How it's changing? And kind of what your expectations are moving through the year? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think first of all, the year-on-year compare for our flash product business is impacted by last year benefiting from elevated levels of backlog that we shipped in the comparable quarter last year. If you -- if you remove that backlog, flash actually grew year-on-year this quarter and we saw strong growth from our capacity flash products. We expect overall flash portfolio to grow as a percentage of our business through the course of the year. The first-quarter customers are still qualifying our capacity flash products, the C-Series. And so we weren't able to move all of our intended customer environments over to all-flash yet, but they are headed that way. And so we feel really good about both the go-to-market changes that are starting to reflect in pipeline expansion as well as in the flash product portfolio that we have. And you should see that reflected in growth in the second-half of the year. With regard to share gains, our expectation based on what the others have guided is that we have picked-up the second position in share in the market behind Dell.\nOperator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nVictor Chiu: Hi, this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. You guys noted that the product gross margin is expected to hold for the remainder of the year, but I think the latest industry forecasts and commentary from NAND manufacturers implies that the market experiences a sharp overcorrection next year. Can you help us understand how this impacts your expectations for the next fiscal year and whether you've secured any pricing agreements for flash media beyond this fiscal year?\nMike Berry: Yes. Hey, Victor, it's Mike. So, hey, we haven't guided for fiscal '25, but let us walk you through that. As we talked about between pre-buys and price locks, we have secured a large portion of our NAND purchases for fiscal '24, not all of it, you never want to hedge the whole bucket, but we feel really good about that. In addition, some of those agreements do flow into fiscal '25, it's not a majority at this point. So where we stand today as we feel really good about where we are at \u201824, we have some of that rolling into '25 and we are certainly looking for about -- what should we do? We'll do a lot more work on that, call it, in the next 90-days and update you on the next call. As you know, it's a very changing market. We want to make sure it be prudent and think through that, but it is something that we are looking hard at.\nVictor Chiu: Okay, that's helpful. And just on the other side of the legacy part of the business, the last several quarters have seen pretty sharp declines in shipments of legacy spinning drives. I know historically, there has not very much correlation between storage media trends, the storage systems, but more recently, one of your competitors have asserted that there won't be any new spinning disk drives manufacturer in five years. Do you have any view on this commentary? Do you agree with this perspective and how do you see this impacting NetApp I guess over the long-run?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think we have the best spinning media and the best flash technologies in the market. I think that's reflected by the richness of our feature set, the flexibility of our operating system and increasingly the data security functionality that natively integrated into our offerings. I think that the outlines of what our competitors have talked about is a long-time. And so we give our customers choice and we'll continue to invest in a broad range of technologies that meet the right price performance points. When you cannot support a type of technology, like our competitors cannot, then you have to throw grenades and say that that technology doesn't exist because you frankly can't support it.\nVictor Chiu: Okay, so you think that that's extreme view that that the past legacy -- is that spinning drives will be gone in five years, that's extreme in your opinion?\nGeorge Kurian: Five years is a long-time in technology as we've all learned.\nVictor Chiu: Yes. Okay, okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great, thank you for taking my question. In the past, I think you guided for some linearity on first-half versus second-half. So just wanted to clarify if that still holds for the remainder of this year? And just back on the public-cloud side of things. I know it's guiding to a little bit lower relative to prior expectations, due to the subscription weakness. How should we think about just the linearity? I mean, are we expecting these run-rates to kind of continue to have any more insight into how we should think about the growth rates for the rest of the year? Are we still looking at something -- are we still expecting from a year-on-year basis as the comps get easier in the back-half of fiscal '24 to have cloud revenues accelerate from this point? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes, thank you for the question. So, on the first question on linearity, based on the midpoint of guidance, we are still assuming about 48% revenue in the first-half and 52% in the second, pretty close to round in which is very consistent with what we did last quarter. So, no big change there. And that's very consistent with the linearity that we've shown historically. Also, our Q2 guide is up about 7% quarter-on-quarter, which is well within our historical linearity as well. On the cloud revenue number, so we're not going to update the guidance. We had originally thought and forecasted somewhere around, call it, mid-teens growth in that cloud revenue business. Even if as you look at the historical numbers, that cloud revenue, and we're not forecasting it, well, if it stays where it's at today, there would still be growth year-over-year because of the growth last year. So we have baked all of that into our full-year number, so we feel good about where we are on that guide. We'll see how the rest of the year goes. But at this point, we've reflected that in our full-year number.\nAsiya Merchant: Great, thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two high-level questions in AI for George. Our understanding is that most of the benefit of storage, as we put all-flash unified file and object solution; A, is that assessment accurate or are you seeing hybrid HDD solutions being used in AI workloads today? And second, for unified cloud and object, can you speak about your product portfolio there and your competitive position, compared to other solutions like FlashBlade from Pure Storage and PowerScale from Dell. And also if unified filing object solutions are more expected of benefit from AI, it's a market share that's similar to market-share in other storage solutions like block and file? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think that the first comment that I would make is AI primarily offerings today on unstructured data, whether it's predictive AI using unstructured data to analyze images or audio files or generative AI that analysis text on various types of document formats, unstructured data is the priority. Second, I think with regard to unified file and object, listen, we created unified storage and we have a really strong track-record in unified across file, block, object and cloud. And I think that is the new definition of unified rather than little systems that tried to say that they've got one protocol or the other. I think the third is when you talk about AI, it's a broad topic. And therefore, what customers typically have is versions of data that they used to trade different models. At the time that they are running the trading workload, they typically store it on a high-performance landscape like all-flash system. But they keep those models available so that they can go back and look at when they make changes to models and data sets and what the implications are for accuracy. And so the archival life cycle of that data is usually on disk or on cloud. And then I think the last point I would make is, listen, we are seeing clients use hybrid workflows. Public cloud is a strong place where a lot of the developers and data science teams are beginning their Workflows, either Vertex in and Google or Sagemaker in Amazon and our solutions on public cloud give us a strong position to start with the data science team at the start of these AI projects.\nKrish Sankar: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great, thanks. Hey, George. Hey Mike. I had some phone difficulties. So I apologize if you addressed this. On sort of the AI sort of strategy going forward versus like mass capacity storage, what are you hearing from your customers from the enterprise side in terms of what the priority looks like from an investment perspective? I know your mass capacity product is seeing some really strong traction out of the gate. But over the longer term, how do you think the mix between high-end, high-performance storage and mass capacity trends? And then maybe just on Public Cloud real quickly, I know this has been sort of a fits and starts business for you. When you think about how much of maybe an impact on your management bandwidth, how are you thinking about that business longer term now? I know you're talking about giving out updated outlook maybe next quarter. But do you still think it has the same opportunity to be a key driver for the business? Or is it maybe a little bit less of a longer-term opportunity today than you might have thought 90 days ago or even a year ago at this point? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Let me hit on those two points. I think the first is with regard to AI, again, as I mentioned, it's a broad life cycle of tasks. There are light portions of the life cycle that run on extremely high-performance systems. And then there are portions of the life cycle where the data sits on more fine-tuned capacity-oriented systems because you want to keep versions of your models available. And so I look at it like any type of workload, there's a portion of time where the workload has data that's hot and then there's a portion of its life cycle where you want to keep a copy of the data. With regard to the overall all-flash array outlook, listen, I think we have one quarter in. We are really pleased with the adoption of our capacity flash products. Overall, what I see is all-flash will grow at higher than our total storage business and will be a bigger part of our mix. Within all-flash, the capacity flash products will grow more quickly than the performance flash products because one is attacking the next tranche of upgrades and refreshes, which is the 10-K drive market while the high-performance products have already been in market for a long period of time. So I think that's how they break that out. With regard to cloud, I think that, listen, the opportunity is strong. We are excited about the growth of our cloud storage services all of the capabilities and the pace of customer adoption of those services. We have more exciting news to come with Google around the work we're doing with them, both with regard to the expansion of our offerings as well as new use cases in the Google Cloud that you'll hear more about in the next couple of weeks. And I think that our approach right now is to focus on the best parts of our cloud portfolio have a dedicated go-to-market model that has been well received by the hyperscalers. We're 1 quarter in. The cloud storage and consumption offerings performed well. We have work to do on the subscription side. We'll give you an update next quarter. Our overall view of cloud has not changed.\nDavid Vogt: Great, thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up on some of those last comments, George, especially on subscription. I guess I'm wondering, obviously, you want to grow faster in public cloud. But -- and the subscription business being down, it seems like it's consistent with the type of macro we're in. So I guess I'm trying to understand more specifically, given all the other stuff that's going on in terms of public cloud, in terms of refining the business, why the subscription business is especially disappointing here as opposed to maybe riding it out until you start to see an up cycle? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. Listen, I think that we are not the only company in the world that had a subscription cloud software business that got impacted. When we saw the trends for optimization, you generally see the consumption part of the business get optimized quickly because you are on a pay-as-you-go contract. I think the subscription part usually gets affected at the time of a renewal of a subscription or a decision to expand or not expand a subscription. That doesn't excuse the fact that we wanted to do better in the subscription part of our business. I think we've got work to do to refine our portfolio, sharpen the value proposition, optimize pricing in certain cases to meet customers' expectations, and we'll give you an update on that. We're already working on those. We'll give you an update on that on the next call.\nSteven Fox: Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. It sounds from your comments like you had at least 7 to 8 points of backlog-related headwind from last year in AFA. Can you help us think through is the magnitude sort of similar in fiscal 2Q? And for fiscal second-half on the Hybrid Cloud side, is it fair to think that there's going to be a 4 to 5 point acceleration in growth? And as you look at the estimates that the Street's modeling is kind of -- that's kind of what is implied. And I'm wondering if you could talk about what is the upside that you're seeing in hybrid that's offsetting the weakness in public, given your relative overall guidance didn't change? Thank you so much.\nMike Berry: Hey, Wamsi, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So let's go through the numbers. So yes, you're pretty close on the impact. It was about [Technical Difficulty] So last quarter, we talked about, if you adjust for the backlog benefit in the first half of fiscal '23 and you compared our growth this first-half with the second-half of last year when we declined about 5% or 6%, we expect the growth to be better than that, still slightly negative. That is about the same in Q1 and Q2, so Q2 has about the same impact. Based on the midpoint of guidance, we do expect Hybrid Cloud then to have growth in the second-half, the low-single-digit growth based on the guidance that we gave. And we're still comfortable with that based on the progress that we saw in Q1, especially related to C-Series. The focus that we have on the new products, as well as the go-to-market changes, we do expect those to bear more fruit as we go into the second-half, and that's based on what we've seen not only in pipelines and then also sales activity. So overall, yes, that would be accurate, and that's what gives us confidence as we go into the second-half of the year.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe as a first question, you noted that the storage and consumption piece of the business you expected that, that was growing about market rate this quarter. I guess just is kind of the assumption there that essentially optimization has stabilized, and we are starting to see growth again? I just kind of want to get a sense of where you guys are in terms of what you -- if we're at kind of the bottom of optimization and seeing growth again or if we're still kind of in this bottom out period? And then as a second question, just if there's any kind of surprises in terms of customer types or workload types that have been more interested in C-Series than kind of initially expected? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: On the first question, Meta, I think that what we saw was continued good pace of customer additions, which means that there are cloud projects and ongoing deployment of workloads on the cloud. We saw the pace of optimization slowdown as customers have basically done the easy stuff. And so now they probably are more cautious about what further to optimize. Within the latter bucket, the customers that have been optimizing, there are early signs of them starting to do new projects on our technology, but they haven't ramped those projects yet. So the benefit we saw within the quarter was new customers and new workloads as opposed to the ones that optimize reaccelerating spending. With regard to the second question, capacity flash, we were selling high-performance flash into use cases where capacity flash was a better product. Those were in two flavors. One would be more of a general purpose private cloud environment where customers don't care about the performance of a particular application, but generally want good performance. And so that was one and then smaller environments where we had the A150 product that was also introduced at a lower price point than any other flash product. Both of them saw strength. And I think we saw strength in the mid-market segment, broadly speaking, across all of our products.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I got caught off in the middle, so I apologize if this was addressed. But on the Public Cloud, can you just talk about what are the reasons that led to the miss of here? Was it macro or there any micro impact as well? And then when you talk about the initiatives you're taking, is it more around just aligning your specialists to the hyperscalers? Or are you taking any more incremental initiatives? Just love to understand macro versus micro impact? And then what are the initiatives you're specifically taking to address them?\nGeorge Kurian: I think broadly speaking, if you look at our cloud business, roughly three-quarter is consumption and one-quarter is subscription. That mix has shifted in favor of consumption a meaningful amount over the last year as customers have preferred more of the marketplace and first-party offerings over some of our more traditional subscription type, bring your own license offerings. I think the impact that we saw was more pronounced in subscription rather than consumption. Consumption performed quite well. And so I would point out that it's in the one-quarter of the business in subscription. Then second, with regard to whether it was macro or micro, it was a mix of things. I think it was -- in some customers, clearly, it was related to budget constraints, where upon renewal, they said, listen, I want to use less of the product and only use it for the most mission-critical environment, some of our monitoring tools. In other cases, it was the customer not being ready to deploy the product and so we've taken a couple of actions. One action is to, as we said, conduct a review of our products, make sure we have the right products tailored to the right use cases that pricing is set up right, that the value share between us and the customers set up right, that is already underway. We've implemented some of those changes. We'll give you a more fulsome update. And then with regard to go-to-market, we've, as we noted, implemented both a dedicated cloud specialist organization aligned with the hyperscalers and also implemented customer success so that customers can get expertise from NetApp on how to use the products. It's early. We've seen some good evidence of progress, but there's more work to be done.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. And Mike, if I could just have you clarify Q1 free cash flow, I think, was much better than what I had expected and what you typically be in Q1, I think, as well. Can you just touch on maybe what drove that, if there was a bit of a pull-in or something with some of the stuff? And any view on fiscal year free cash flow, given the strong performance here?\nMike Berry: Yes. Awesome. Thanks for the question on cash. Yes, there was -- it was quite a bit better than we thought. There was three moving parts. Amit, I would say you've seen billings come in lower in the last two quarters. So collections were down year-over-year. But what really drove the operating and free cash flow was the reduction in our supply chain spending. And that's not only premiums. It's the quantity of components that came down significantly. And then, of course, pricing came down as well. So that, if you think about the rest of the year, we should expect to continue to see some of that benefit not as big as in Q1 because that compares to Q1 of last year when we were still, I'll call it, bulking up on inventory because we expect the growth before things slowed down in the middle of the year. You know, the one-time benefit year-over-year, which unfortunately is we paid a good bit less in incentive compensation. So that helped drive it as well. And then lower CapEx helped drive free cash flow as well. And we did say, hey, the $239 million we spent last year, we expect to be the high and we expect that to continue to come down. As you look at the rest of the year, we do expect on a full-year basis it to track pretty close to non-GAAP net income, which guidance is somewhere around $1.2 billion. I do want to note, though, hey, folks in Q2 -- and this happens every year, keep in mind, it's the quarter we pay most of our taxes. So we pay almost $88 million in repatriation taxes and then we make our U.S. federal tax payment as well. So expect Q2 to be down from Q1, and it's been like that every year. And then in the back half, following more typical trends. So thanks for the question.\nAmit Daryanani: Thank you.\nOperator: And the final question today comes from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I guess my first question, George, can you talk about ONTAP AI from a competitive standpoint? Are you seeing this as an ability basically to sell into your existing customer base you are using ONTAP and comfortable with it in that? Or is this something that, from a competitive differentiation standpoint, can actually drive switchers to NetApp's product set? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We sell ONTAP AI into data science teams and AI teams, whether they are in our installed base or net new accounts. They are -- it's a very verticalized selling model. So for example, in pharmaceuticals, we work with teams on rapid drug discovery, clinical data analysis so that they can apply really high-performance GPUs from NVIDIA with -- together with large-scale data storage from NetApp. We could also do the same thing. For example, in manufacturing, we are selling into advanced digital twin prototypes where they are optimizing manufacturing yield and sort of accelerating development. So I think those are the key areas that we have sort of net new budget, net new customer landscape. Our advantages are high performance, large scale advanced demo management, the best in the industry, and it's highly integrated into the data science toolkit of our customers. And then increasingly, we also now have the same versions of 2 chains running on all the leading public clouds, and you'll hear more about that in the next couple of weeks at the Google conference.\nShannon Cross: Okay. And then I guess we've asked you about AI from sort of an opportunity standpoint. But how are you thinking about utilizing generative AI internally within NetApp to increase productivity, save costs and maybe, I don't know, improve customer experience? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: We already use AI tools in three ways. One is to accelerate software development and to increase the pace at which we can deliver more innovation to customers. The second, to integrate AI into our products and services so that we can automatically detect, for example, ransomware attacks or impending risks from running systems harder than they should be or various other things and give customers proactive advice rather than reactive response. And then the third is across the range of our businesses, everything from marketing collateral, documentation, multilingual support as well as chatbots. In customer service, we have AI capabilities already being integrated. And Gen AI is the next version of that. So there are lots of exciting projects underway on that. Thank you, Shannon.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Let me close with a few comments. The strong customer reception to the substantial innovation we have brought to market has got in FY '24 to a solid start, despite the choppy macro backdrop. We are laser-focused on our FY '24 priorities to be prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, to reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in our storage systems business and to build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. Early results of this focus indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth while yielding top line growth in the back half of the year. I am absolutely delighted by the positive reception to our new products, the differentiation and continued growth of our first-party public cloud storage services and our exciting innovation road map. I hope to see you at INSIGHT and look forward to updating on our continued progress on next quarter's call. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Berry",
            "content": "Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed a solid quarter in a challenging macro environment, hitting or exceeding all our guidance ranges. We are delivering on our commitments, evident in our solid Q1 results. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our disciplined operational management and the strong customer acceptance of our innovation continues to pay off. We expect improved execution and new products will drive growth and operating margin expansion as we move through the second-half of the year. As expected, Q1 consolidated gross margin was strong. Product margin came in at 55%. Given our expectations for competitive dynamics and product mix, we remain confident in our projection that product margin will hold at these levels through the remainder of the fiscal year. Cash from operations was a first quarter all-time high. Operating cash flow benefited from the reduction of premiums, as well as lower component pricing and incentive compensation payouts. Over the course of fiscal year \u201824, cash flow should normalize, with operating cash flow tracking relatively in line with non-GAAP net income. We returned approximately 120% of free cash flow to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing Q1 fiscal \u201824 share count by almost 4% year-over-year. As we discussed during last quarter's call, we intend to return 100% of free cash flow this year. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q1 billings of $1.3 billion decreased 17% year-over-year. Revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 10% year-over-year. The challenging macro environment continued to pressure IT spending. However, as George pointed out, we are well aligned to customers' priority investments and remain confident our go-to-market changes and product innovations will drive growth in the second-half of fiscal year \u201824. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.3 billion was down 12% year-over-year. Product revenue of $590 million was down 25%. Remember that first-half fiscal year 2023 revenue, most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. Support revenue of $611 million grew 2% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR grew 6% year-over-year to $619 million. Public Cloud revenue of $154 million increased 17% from Q1 a year ago. First party and marketplace services grew as customers continue to choose solutions based on NetApp technology for mission-critical and cloud native workloads. This growth was offset by underperformance in subscription services. As George noted earlier, Public Cloud did not meet our expectations for the quarter, and we are taking action to hone our approach and reaccelerate growth. Q1 consolidated gross margin of 71% came in above our guidance, up 400 basis points from a year ago, and again reaching an all-time company high. Product gross margin was 55%, in line with expectations. As we discussed on the Q4 call, we made strategic purchase commitments to lock-in record low NAND pricing and mitigate rising prices in the future. NAND prices continued to decline in Q1, and we are still positioned favorably versus the market. The potential for increased price competition is factored into our expectations and we remain confident in our ability to hold product gross margin consistent at this level through the year. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margin of 92%. Public cloud gross margin improved to 67% from 66% last quarter. As expected, operating expenses of $703 million were flat year-over-year and grew 4% from Q4'23. The sequential increase was driven by annual merit increases and a reset of incentive compensation, as well as expenses related to our in-person sales kick-off meeting. Q1 again highlighted the strength of our business model and disciplined operational execution with operating margin of 22%, ahead of expectations. EPS of $1.15 was also above the high end of our guidance. Operating cash flow was $453 million in Q1, an increase of 61% year-over-year, driven by lower supply chain payments and variable compensation, partially offset by lower collections. In Q1, DSO decreased to 41 and inventory turns improved to 13. Free cash flow increased 94% year-over-year to $418 million, helped by strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. During the quarter, we returned $506 million to stockholders through shares repurchased and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $600 million in net cash. We have approximately $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q1 was $4.2 billion, up slightly from a year ago. We ended the quarter with approximately $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for the full-year. Our total revenue guide is unchanged, with revenue down low to mid-single-digits year-over-year, measured on a percentage basis. Based on our Q1 results and updated projections, we expect Public Cloud revenue growth to come in lower than initially expected primarily due to softness in our subscription services. This minor weakness is expected to be at least offset by strength in our Hybrid Cloud revenue. We continue to expect fiscal year '24 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, operating margin to be approximately 25%, and EPS to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.85. We expect Q2 revenue to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a decline of 8% year-over-year. If FX rates stay at end-of-July levels, we would see nearly 2 points of FX tailwinds to revenue. As I called out earlier, first-half fiscal year \u201823 revenue benefited from elevated levels of backlog due to last year's supply chain constraints, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, and operating margin to be approximately 24%. EPS should be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. In closing, I want to thank our employees, customers and investors for their commitment and investment in NetApp. I am confident in our ability to help our customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud transformation goals. We are well aligned to priority IT investments and are committed to deliver sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q & A. Kris? And then, hey, Mehdi, it's Mike. On the QLC, we're not going to break-out specific numbers, but we would say we are procuring more of that. We started to see the pickup. We'll see how the rest of the year goes, but we do expect that to continue as a percentage as we go through fiscal '24. Hey Joe, it's Mike. So, on your question, we've talked a lot about premiums and as we talked about last-time, we're super-excited and not have to talk about them anymore. So largely in Q1, all of those premiums have I would say gone away, not only from a P&L perspective, but cash. We talked about that number was anywhere typically between, call it, $30 million and $40 million a quarter, sometimes it bumped up to $50 million, so call it an average of about $40 million. That -- we got a good bit of that. We did not have to accrue in Q4 and then the rest hold to Q1. So it's 55% last quarter, 55% this quarter. And now premiums are fully out-of-the number. So as you look-forward, it's one of the reasons why we feel confident in the 55% guide. There -- hey, there has always been price competition. We see it in certain geographies or certain customers. We haven't seen any material change to that in our guide. We do expect that we will be -- we will need to be, call it, marginally more aggressive in certain situations, but certainly nothing significantly different than we are today. Yes. Yes. Hey, Victor, it's Mike. So, hey, we haven't guided for fiscal '25, but let us walk you through that. As we talked about between pre-buys and price locks, we have secured a large portion of our NAND purchases for fiscal '24, not all of it, you never want to hedge the whole bucket, but we feel really good about that. In addition, some of those agreements do flow into fiscal '25, it's not a majority at this point. So where we stand today as we feel really good about where we are at \u201824, we have some of that rolling into '25 and we are certainly looking for about -- what should we do? We'll do a lot more work on that, call it, in the next 90-days and update you on the next call. As you know, it's a very changing market. We want to make sure it be prudent and think through that, but it is something that we are looking hard at. Hey, Wamsi, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So let's go through the numbers. So yes, you're pretty close on the impact. It was about [Technical Difficulty] So last quarter, we talked about, if you adjust for the backlog benefit in the first half of fiscal '23 and you compared our growth this first-half with the second-half of last year when we declined about 5% or 6%, we expect the growth to be better than that, still slightly negative. That is about the same in Q1 and Q2, so Q2 has about the same impact. Based on the midpoint of guidance, we do expect Hybrid Cloud then to have growth in the second-half, the low-single-digit growth based on the guidance that we gave. And we're still comfortable with that based on the progress that we saw in Q1, especially related to C-Series. The focus that we have on the new products, as well as the go-to-market changes, we do expect those to bear more fruit as we go into the second-half, and that's based on what we've seen not only in pipelines and then also sales activity. So overall, yes, that would be accurate, and that's what gives us confidence as we go into the second-half of the year. Yes. Awesome. Thanks for the question on cash. Yes, there was -- it was quite a bit better than we thought. There was three moving parts. Amit, I would say you've seen billings come in lower in the last two quarters. So collections were down year-over-year. But what really drove the operating and free cash flow was the reduction in our supply chain spending. And that's not only premiums. It's the quantity of components that came down significantly. And then, of course, pricing came down as well. So that, if you think about the rest of the year, we should expect to continue to see some of that benefit not as big as in Q1 because that compares to Q1 of last year when we were still, I'll call it, bulking up on inventory because we expect the growth before things slowed down in the middle of the year. You know, the one-time benefit year-over-year, which unfortunately is we paid a good bit less in incentive compensation. So that helped drive it as well. And then lower CapEx helped drive free cash flow as well. And we did say, hey, the $239 million we spent last year, we expect to be the high and we expect that to continue to come down. As you look at the rest of the year, we do expect on a full-year basis it to track pretty close to non-GAAP net income, which guidance is somewhere around $1.2 billion. I do want to note, though, hey, folks in Q2 -- and this happens every year, keep in mind, it's the quarter we pay most of our taxes. So we pay almost $88 million in repatriation taxes and then we make our U.S. federal tax payment as well. So expect Q2 to be down from Q1, and it's been like that every year. And then in the back half, following more typical trends. So thanks for the question."

            "content": "Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Q1 marks a solid start to FY '24 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance, while our operational discipline yielded operating margin and EPS above our guidance ranges. As I have outlined on previous calls, we are focused on: managing the elements within our control; reinvigorating efforts to drive better performance in our storage business; and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive early indicators from this plan to sharpen our execution, deliver growth, increase profitability, and further strengthen our position for long-term success. Looking at the results of the quarter, I am especially pleased with the reception to our recent product introductions. The AFF C-series has been the fastest ramping all-flash product launch in our history, with strong demand across all products in the family. Similarly, the AFF A150, our entry-level, high performance all-flash array, grew quickly in its first full quarter of shipping. Our Storage Lifecycle Program is also seeing good early uptake, driving longer-term commitments to NetApp as we help customers future-proof their environments with a world-class ownership experience. Building on this momentum, we introduced more storage innovation in Q1. We announced the ASA A-series, a family of SAN-specific all-flash arrays, supported by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees. These systems are the only all-SAN storage arrays with virtual machine and application-granular data protection mechanisms. Complementing our unified storage offerings, they enable us to expand on the tens of thousands of customers who already use NetApp for block storage today and drive share gains in the $18 billion SAN market. In addition to delivering on our innovation agenda, we have implemented the go-to-market changes we outlined on the Q4 call, focusing our enterprise sellers on the flash opportunity and building a dedicated model for cloud. In May, we held our annual sales kickoff meeting, the first time we've gathered the global team in person since the pandemic. Everyone was energized by the innovation we're bringing to market and the objectives appropriately aligned to each team's strengths. Because many of the products we've introduced open new TAM for us, we are also including training to sharpen our attack on these opportunities. The changes have been well received, are already showing up in pipeline expansion, and should help drive top line growth in the second-half. Q1 Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.3 billion was down 12% year-over-year. Our all-flash array business decreased 7% from Q1 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. The demand environment is unchanged from the last half of FY '23, with headwinds from enterprise continuing to weigh on product and AFA revenue. Additionally, as Mike will outline, the first-half of fiscal year '23 benefited from elevated backlog, impacting the year-over-year comparisons. In the past few quarters, every conversation I've had with customers and investors has touched on artificial intelligence. Generative AI is top of mind for everyone. While still in the early innings of this opportunity, AI is not a new topic for us. We have been a leader in storage for predictive AI and machine learning workloads since we introduced ONTAP AI, a joint NetApp and NVIDIA-proven architecture, in 2018. Today, hundreds of customers rely on NetApp's storage infrastructure and data management for their AI workloads, including some of the largest pharmaceutical, financial services and retail companies in the world. Effective predictive and generative AI projects depend on high quality, well-managed, unstructured data. The data pipeline and workflow typically involve data from multiple file and object sources across cloud and on premises. High performance, highly scalable hybrid cloud storage and data management is a core NetApp advantage and naturally positions us as a leader in this market and will continue to benefit us as the Gen AI market evolves. While early, we are already engaged with customers who are interested in fine-tuning large language models with their own data on-premises, as well as those who are leveraging the hyperscalers' Gen AI offerings on the public cloud together with the storage and data management capabilities of NetApp Cloud Volumes services. Accelerated by the rise of AI, data continues to grow in both volume and value. A company's data is its most valuable asset. Our robust cyber resilience portfolio helps customers ensure that they have the right enterprise data protection and security on-premises and in the cloud. With built-in features that protect and secure data and deliver rapid recovery based on AI and machine learning, our systems can proactively spot and counter malicious or anomalous actions. Our confidence in our industry-leading capabilities is underscored by the ransomware recovery guarantee we announced in Q1 and demonstrated by the fact that NetApp is the only enterprise storage vendor on the NSA's classified program components list. Now, turning to Public Cloud. I want to acknowledge our cloud results have not been where we want them to be and assure you we are taking definitive actions to hone our approach and get back on track. At the start of this year, we aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners' go-to-market structures. Additionally, we are in the process of a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio, expand on the success of first party services and improve subscription performance. We will have more details to share with you on our next call. That said, Public Cloud segment revenue in Q1 was $154 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Public Cloud DBNRR declined to 107%. Within these numbers, strength in first party and marketplace consumption services was masked by weakness in our subscription services. Let me emphasize that our strategic focus is on first party cloud storage services, and we continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as revenue and ARR growth in this part of the portfolio. Our expectations for FY '24 Public Cloud revenue are reflected in the guidance Mike will walk you through. First party storage services, branded and sold by our cloud partners, position us uniquely and represent our biggest opportunity. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and delivering growth. Our close and long-standing relationship with Microsoft Azure continues to deliver solid growth. Likewise, our partnership with Google remains strong. And in the coming weeks, you can expect to hear exciting news about the expansion of our partnership. Our relationship with AWS is also yielding positive results. As expected, we are starting to win large enterprise deployments with FSx for NetApp ONTAP. We were chosen to be the cloud storage infrastructure for a global sportswear manufacturer's SAP HANA deployment. FSxN was the only storage service that could meet the company's mission-critical service level, availability, and recovery requirements. This is a large, long-term SAP project that will continue to develop and grow over the coming years, driving significant consumption of FSxN capacity. Once completed, it will be one of the largest SAP environments on AWS. In the face of the challenging macro, demand remains muted, and sales cycles remain elongated. Although customers continue to exhibit caution, they are moving forward with strategic initiatives, prioritizing investments in applications and technologies that drive business productivity and growth. Our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure and data management enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely and sustainably. Customers turn to NetApp to help them increase the performance and reliability of their digital and cloud transformational projects. Looking forward, our priorities are clear. We will continue to tightly manage the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in the storage business, and continue to refine our Public Cloud business. Early results indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth year-over-year while yielding top-line growth in the back half of fiscal year '24. Before turning the call over to Mike, I want to thank the NetApp team for their continued focus. I also want to remind you we'll be hosting our INSIGHT user conference in person in Las Vegas this October. We hope to see you there. Overall -- thank you for the question. Overall, the spending environment this past quarter was unchanged from what we saw in the second half of the prior fiscal year. Our mid-sized enterprise business across the globe and public sector did better than large enterprise. Within large enterprise, as we noted, the same verticals remained cautious in spending, service provider, high-tech and, to a lesser extent, financial services. With regard to their spending criterion, they are spending on strategic projects but are running infrastructure, broadly speaking, hotter than meaning at higher levels of utilization than they typically do and what we typically tell them is best practice. That is common in such macro environments, but it's not a long-term trend. I think we expect them as we progress through the fiscal year for them to start to expand investment because they cannot run systems that hard. As we noted in our prepared remarks and in prior calls, we do not expect the macro to change substantially to support our guidance for the year. Our guidance for the year reflects our confidence both in the changes that we made in go-to-market as well as in our product portfolio that we recently introduced. With regard to Gen AI projects, which we are already engaged in, in a number of customers, we see a mix of use cases. I would say there are three common patterns. One is unstructured data. The second is the need for consistent data management, both security and privacy are hot topics as well as the lineage of data so that they can keep track of which version of Gen AI model is the best and most accurate. And then the third is from a deployment architecture, we are seeing them engage in both on-prem discussions, as well as public cloud discussions. In public cloud, the advantages are much faster feature velocity, as well as prepackaged models available on the public cloud. With the on-prem environments, the major sensitivity is the data being kept in a restricted location. So we intend to benefit from both. I don't think that it is a meaningful driver of repatriation at this point in the discussion maybe. There we're seeing a mix of public cloud and on-prem environments. Yes, I think first of all, our -- we have two models in which we serve customers; the consumption model, which is essentially a pay-as-you-go utility model; and then a subscription model, which is where the customer pays for a certain amount of capacity or managed units or capability and then renews that on an annual basis or a term basis. Then consumption part of our business has grown to about three quarters of our total business, roughly speaking. Of our cloud business, subscription is the quarter. And if you look at the last quarter's performance, the cloud storage and consumption businesses continue to perform well. They grew year-on-year. Their dollar-based net retention rate was at the industry average, industry norms. Subscription is where we saw a challenge, both a small part of cloud storage subscription as well as CloudOps and we are conducting a review and we'll get you an update at the next quarterly call about our plans for that part of our business. I think first of all, the year-on-year compare for our flash product business is impacted by last year benefiting from elevated levels of backlog that we shipped in the comparable quarter last year. If you -- if you remove that backlog, flash actually grew year-on-year this quarter and we saw strong growth from our capacity flash products. We expect overall flash portfolio to grow as a percentage of our business through the course of the year. The first-quarter customers are still qualifying our capacity flash products, the C-Series. And so we weren't able to move all of our intended customer environments over to all-flash yet, but they are headed that way. And so we feel really good about both the go-to-market changes that are starting to reflect in pipeline expansion as well as in the flash product portfolio that we have. And you should see that reflected in growth in the second-half of the year. With regard to share gains, our expectation based on what the others have guided is that we have picked-up the second position in share in the market behind Dell. Listen, I think we have the best spinning media and the best flash technologies in the market. I think that's reflected by the richness of our feature set, the flexibility of our operating system and increasingly the data security functionality that natively integrated into our offerings. I think that the outlines of what our competitors have talked about is a long-time. And so we give our customers choice and we'll continue to invest in a broad range of technologies that meet the right price performance points. When you cannot support a type of technology, like our competitors cannot, then you have to throw grenades and say that that technology doesn't exist because you frankly can't support it. Five years is a long-time in technology as we've all learned. Yes, thank you for the question. So, on the first question on linearity, based on the midpoint of guidance, we are still assuming about 48% revenue in the first-half and 52% in the second, pretty close to round in which is very consistent with what we did last quarter. So, no big change there. And that's very consistent with the linearity that we've shown historically. Also, our Q2 guide is up about 7% quarter-on-quarter, which is well within our historical linearity as well. On the cloud revenue number, so we're not going to update the guidance. We had originally thought and forecasted somewhere around, call it, mid-teens growth in that cloud revenue business. Even if as you look at the historical numbers, that cloud revenue, and we're not forecasting it, well, if it stays where it's at today, there would still be growth year-over-year because of the growth last year. So we have baked all of that into our full-year number, so we feel good about where we are on that guide. We'll see how the rest of the year goes. But at this point, we've reflected that in our full-year number. Thank you. Listen, I think that the first comment that I would make is AI primarily offerings today on unstructured data, whether it's predictive AI using unstructured data to analyze images or audio files or generative AI that analysis text on various types of document formats, unstructured data is the priority. Second, I think with regard to unified file and object, listen, we created unified storage and we have a really strong track-record in unified across file, block, object and cloud. And I think that is the new definition of unified rather than little systems that tried to say that they've got one protocol or the other. I think the third is when you talk about AI, it's a broad topic. And therefore, what customers typically have is versions of data that they used to trade different models. At the time that they are running the trading workload, they typically store it on a high-performance landscape like all-flash system. But they keep those models available so that they can go back and look at when they make changes to models and data sets and what the implications are for accuracy. And so the archival life cycle of that data is usually on disk or on cloud. And then I think the last point I would make is, listen, we are seeing clients use hybrid workflows. Public cloud is a strong place where a lot of the developers and data science teams are beginning their Workflows, either Vertex in and Google or Sagemaker in Amazon and our solutions on public cloud give us a strong position to start with the data science team at the start of these AI projects. Let me hit on those two points. I think the first is with regard to AI, again, as I mentioned, it's a broad life cycle of tasks. There are light portions of the life cycle that run on extremely high-performance systems. And then there are portions of the life cycle where the data sits on more fine-tuned capacity-oriented systems because you want to keep versions of your models available. And so I look at it like any type of workload, there's a portion of time where the workload has data that's hot and then there's a portion of its life cycle where you want to keep a copy of the data. With regard to the overall all-flash array outlook, listen, I think we have one quarter in. We are really pleased with the adoption of our capacity flash products. Overall, what I see is all-flash will grow at higher than our total storage business and will be a bigger part of our mix. Within all-flash, the capacity flash products will grow more quickly than the performance flash products because one is attacking the next tranche of upgrades and refreshes, which is the 10-K drive market while the high-performance products have already been in market for a long period of time. So I think that's how they break that out. With regard to cloud, I think that, listen, the opportunity is strong. We are excited about the growth of our cloud storage services all of the capabilities and the pace of customer adoption of those services. We have more exciting news to come with Google around the work we're doing with them, both with regard to the expansion of our offerings as well as new use cases in the Google Cloud that you'll hear more about in the next couple of weeks. And I think that our approach right now is to focus on the best parts of our cloud portfolio have a dedicated go-to-market model that has been well received by the hyperscalers. We're 1 quarter in. The cloud storage and consumption offerings performed well. We have work to do on the subscription side. We'll give you an update next quarter. Our overall view of cloud has not changed. Yes. Listen, I think that we are not the only company in the world that had a subscription cloud software business that got impacted. When we saw the trends for optimization, you generally see the consumption part of the business get optimized quickly because you are on a pay-as-you-go contract. I think the subscription part usually gets affected at the time of a renewal of a subscription or a decision to expand or not expand a subscription. That doesn't excuse the fact that we wanted to do better in the subscription part of our business. I think we've got work to do to refine our portfolio, sharpen the value proposition, optimize pricing in certain cases to meet customers' expectations, and we'll give you an update on that. We're already working on those. We'll give you an update on that on the next call. On the first question, Meta, I think that what we saw was continued good pace of customer additions, which means that there are cloud projects and ongoing deployment of workloads on the cloud. We saw the pace of optimization slowdown as customers have basically done the easy stuff. And so now they probably are more cautious about what further to optimize. Within the latter bucket, the customers that have been optimizing, there are early signs of them starting to do new projects on our technology, but they haven't ramped those projects yet. So the benefit we saw within the quarter was new customers and new workloads as opposed to the ones that optimize reaccelerating spending. With regard to the second question, capacity flash, we were selling high-performance flash into use cases where capacity flash was a better product. Those were in two flavors. One would be more of a general purpose private cloud environment where customers don't care about the performance of a particular application, but generally want good performance. And so that was one and then smaller environments where we had the A150 product that was also introduced at a lower price point than any other flash product. Both of them saw strength. And I think we saw strength in the mid-market segment, broadly speaking, across all of our products. I think broadly speaking, if you look at our cloud business, roughly three-quarter is consumption and one-quarter is subscription. That mix has shifted in favor of consumption a meaningful amount over the last year as customers have preferred more of the marketplace and first-party offerings over some of our more traditional subscription type, bring your own license offerings. I think the impact that we saw was more pronounced in subscription rather than consumption. Consumption performed quite well. And so I would point out that it's in the one-quarter of the business in subscription. Then second, with regard to whether it was macro or micro, it was a mix of things. I think it was -- in some customers, clearly, it was related to budget constraints, where upon renewal, they said, listen, I want to use less of the product and only use it for the most mission-critical environment, some of our monitoring tools. In other cases, it was the customer not being ready to deploy the product and so we've taken a couple of actions. One action is to, as we said, conduct a review of our products, make sure we have the right products tailored to the right use cases that pricing is set up right, that the value share between us and the customers set up right, that is already underway. We've implemented some of those changes. We'll give you a more fulsome update. And then with regard to go-to-market, we've, as we noted, implemented both a dedicated cloud specialist organization aligned with the hyperscalers and also implemented customer success so that customers can get expertise from NetApp on how to use the products. It's early. We've seen some good evidence of progress, but there's more work to be done. We sell ONTAP AI into data science teams and AI teams, whether they are in our installed base or net new accounts. They are -- it's a very verticalized selling model. So for example, in pharmaceuticals, we work with teams on rapid drug discovery, clinical data analysis so that they can apply really high-performance GPUs from NVIDIA with -- together with large-scale data storage from NetApp. We could also do the same thing. For example, in manufacturing, we are selling into advanced digital twin prototypes where they are optimizing manufacturing yield and sort of accelerating development. So I think those are the key areas that we have sort of net new budget, net new customer landscape. Our advantages are high performance, large scale advanced demo management, the best in the industry, and it's highly integrated into the data science toolkit of our customers. And then increasingly, we also now have the same versions of 2 chains running on all the leading public clouds, and you'll hear more about that in the next couple of weeks at the Google conference. We already use AI tools in three ways. One is to accelerate software development and to increase the pace at which we can deliver more innovation to customers. The second, to integrate AI into our products and services so that we can automatically detect, for example, ransomware attacks or impending risks from running systems harder than they should be or various other things and give customers proactive advice rather than reactive response. And then the third is across the range of our businesses, everything from marketing collateral, documentation, multilingual support as well as chatbots. In customer service, we have AI capabilities already being integrated. And Gen AI is the next version of that. So there are lots of exciting projects underway on that. Thank you, Shannon. Let me close with a few comments. The strong customer reception to the substantial innovation we have brought to market has got in FY '24 to a solid start, despite the choppy macro backdrop. We are laser-focused on our FY '24 priorities to be prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, to reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in our storage systems business and to build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. Early results of this focus indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth while yielding top line growth in the back half of the year. I am absolutely delighted by the positive reception to our new products, the differentiation and continued growth of our first-party public cloud storage services and our exciting innovation road map. I hope to see you at INSIGHT and look forward to updating on our continued progress on next quarter's call. Thank you."
