[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today, Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nTodd Chirillo : Thank you, Jewel. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Villavarayan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, all of whom will be available for questions following the call.

Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Craig: Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Before we review our results, I would like to take a moment to address the leadership transition plan we announced last week. After nearly 6 years as CEO, I will transition to the role of Executive Chairman of the Board on February 28. At that time, Chris Villavarayan, our Chief Operating Officer, has been selected to succeed me as Meritor's next CEO and President. Additionally, Bill Newlin, our current Chairman, will become the lead Director of the Board. Since I assumed the CEO position, we have made great strides through execution of our M2016, M2019 and now our M2022 plans. We have advanced our innovation and product portfolio, strengthened our financial foundation and created a collaborative and diverse organization that fosters growth. M2022 is well underway and we are seeing signs of recovery in our business and industry since the onset of COVID-19, which I'll touch upon more later. That said, we believe now is the ideal time to set in motion our long-term succession plan. Many of you know Chris, who has been lit Meritor for more than 2 decades and is an integral member of our leadership team. He has had a significant impact on our company during his tenure, and this transition represents a natural next step. On a personal note, Chris has been a true partner to me, helping to execute our successful and plans. In the months ahead, I will continue to lead Meritor and work closely with Chris as we prepare for a smooth transition. Now let's turn to our results on Slide 3. Obviously, our fourth quarter and full year results were unfavorably impacted by lower volumes due to the pandemic. However, we were able to partly offset the impact on our margin for the quarter and for the year, with the cost-reduction actions we implemented in the second half. Carl will give you more detail on the results, but the important takeaway here is the extent to which we are able to preserve our financial stability, considering the significance of the headwind created by COVID-19. As you see in the center of the slide, we're able to execute well on an approximate 50% increase in sales sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth, with a conversion rate of 22%. All things considered, we recovered from the crisis exceptionally well. We took aggressive actions to protect the company financially, and most importantly, we took immediate steps to protect our employees while it worked. While certain countries and states where we have operations are experiencing rising case counts, we remain fully operational globally with no limitations at this time. Let's turn to Slide 4. While the pandemic required a great deal of management attention in 2020, we still had many achievements that support all aspects of M2022. Our safety, quality and delivery metrics were excellent. With regard to safety, the total recordable case rate was 0.57 per 200,000 hours worked with more than 50% of our facilities reporting 0 recordables for the year. We believe this makes us one of the safest global manufacturers in the world. This speaks volumes for our team's commitment to each other and is certainly one of the accomplishments I am most proud of during my tenure. We are honored to receive Daimler's coveted Global Supplier Award this year for providing more than 1 million axles, brakes and drive lines, with excellent quality and parts per million rates during the peak 2019 North American market. In addition, we are able to repurchase 10.4 million shares in fiscal 2020, were added to the S&P 600 SmallCap Index and announced 4 footprint actions, 3 in the United States and 1 in Europe. We expect these actions to generate annual run rate savings of approximately $10 million and give us added confidence to achieving our M2022 objectives. In July, we celebrated production of our 100 millionth remanufactured brake shoe. With nearly 50% of remanufactured brake shoe production in North America, Meritor is the industry leader. We continue to win new business with important customers and later in the discussion, Carl will review our expected outperformance against the M2022 new business target. And finally, we received approval from our Board for an incremental $30 million to industrialize medium and heavy applications for our ePowertrain portfolio, more on that in a moment. On Slide 5, you will see additional detail related to the long-term agreement we signed with Daimler. This is an important contract for us that extends our relationship with Daimler through 2027 and will now put Meritor in standard position for air disc brakes on the Freightliner Cascadia through 2025. Let's look at Slide 6 for an update on electrification. Essentially, the takeaway here is that we will be in production with our electric powertrain in 2021. The picture on this slide was taken recently at our EE powertrain assembly operation. We are very excited that we are only months away from delivering under the contract we secured with PACCAR for its heavy-duty electric trucks. In advance of production, the 14Xe is already receiving industry acclaim. Earlier this year, we told you we were recognized as a 2020 PACEpilot Honoree by Automotive News for our Blue Horizon electrification solutions. And recently, Meritor received the Diesel Progress Achievement of the Year and Electric Application of the Year awards. We believe we will be the first supplier to begin production of electric powertrains for Class 8 electric vehicles, and we anticipate additional production contracts in 2021. Let's go to the next slide. As you know, customers have numerous electric drivetrain solutions to consider. We are often asked about the remote mount architecture versus the electric powertrain. Meritor's electric powertrain is revolutionary and that we are taking an electric motor and a multi-speed transmission and integrating them into the carrier. We are not just bolting on a motor. This design is fully integrated and designed to maximize efficiency, performance, weight savings and space utilization. By partnering with the leading motor technology companies in the world, we have designed the electric motor from the ground up to meet and exceed customer expectations and performance targets. And since this technology is based on Meritor's traditional 14X axle design manufacturing is easier, and OEMs can integrate it into existing chassis using the same mounting locations and hardware. Although we are prepared to deliver e-optimized axles for remote mount solutions, Meritor's class-leading integrated powertrain architecture is beginning to be the product of choice within the commercial vehicle industry. We believe we've developed the most advanced electric powertrain for medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles in the industry and that it will be game-changing. On this slide, we have provided the hotlink to meritor.com, where you can get an inside look at the e powertrain production at our plants in addition to a video that shows the differences between the architectures I described. With that, I'll turn the call over to Carl.\nCarl Anderson: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results, provide fiscal year 2021 outlook and provide an update on our M2022 financial goals. Now let's walk through our financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 8. First, I will review our segment results for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck decreased by just over $200 million year-over-year. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower volumes in most markets due to COVID-19. While volumes were down year-over-year, we did see production increase throughout the quarter as we began to recover from the shutdowns earlier in the year. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $24 million, down $48 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 4.3%, down 500 basis points from a year ago. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily by lower market volumes. In addition, we increased our electrification spend by $6 million compared to last year. This was partially offset by cost-reduction actions primarily executed in the second half of the year, lower incentive compensation and operational performance. Aftermarket industrial sales were $226 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, down 22% compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by lower volumes in our North America aftermarket specialty and defense businesses. Aftermarket sales were also negatively impacted by $36 million due to the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. While revenues were lower, segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 15% from 14.2% in the prior year. The margin increase was driven by cost-reduction actions, lower incentive compensation and operational performance, which more than offset lower volume. For the full year, revenue came in just north of $3 billion, down 31% from the same period last year. The revenue decrease was driven primarily by lower market volumes across our segments due to COVID-19. Net income from continuing operations attributable to the company was $244 million compared to $290 million in the prior year. We did incur $27 million of restructuring expense in 2020 due to the headcount reduction programs executed throughout the year. This was partially offset by $203 million of after-tax income associated with the termination of the company's distribution arrangement in fiscal year 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was $272 million in fiscal year 2020, translating to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.9%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.12, down from $3.82 in the prior year. Finally, free cash flow is $180 million in 2020. This does include the benefit of $265 million in cash received from the termination of the distribution arrangement. Excluding this impact, free cash flow was negative $85 million for the full year. Keep in mind, this includes the impact from our factoring programs that were down $77 million this year due primarily from lower European revenue. As markets begin to recover, this will be a tailwind for free cash flow as we move forward. Next, I'll review our key balance sheet metrics on Slide 9. We ended the fiscal year with a strong liquidity position of over $1 billion, which is up almost $200 million from last year. Our cash on hand is $315 million, which is more than we typically hold. Given the current environment, we believe it is prudent to run higher cash balances at this time. Our funded status and our pension plans also significantly improved, and we are now in a net global overfunding status on our plans. It is important to note that we achieved this milestone without any cash contributions over the past several years. Our long-term liability driven investment strategy and strong asset returns drove the increase in the funding status. Moving to our debt maturity profile. We have no significant maturities for the next 3 years. We recently called the remaining $23 million of 7.875% convertible debt which upon completion will reduce both our outstanding debt and the share dilution associated with its convertible instrument. Furthermore, our 2024 bonds are currently callable, which provides further flexibility to be opportunistic in managing our debt profile. Additionally, while our leverage is expected to be above our target range in the near term, we do expect to deploy capital to begin to pay down debt in the second half of 2021. Next, I'll review our current global market outlook on Slide 10. You will notice we are giving market ranges wider than our typical guidance. While most global markets point to recovery in 2021, we are prudently planning for a variety of scenarios. In the North America Class 8 market, we are projecting production levels between 215,000 to 255,000 units. We have seen an increase in orders over the last several months, which could point to the upper end of the range. At the same time, some of this recent activity could prove to be transitory given the changing conditions associated with the virus. As we look at our other markets, we anticipate Europe will be in the range of 300,000 to 350,000 units. In addition to the new restrictions currently being imposed in certain European countries, we are also closely monitoring Brexit as we move throughout 2021. For India, we are projecting the market will increase at the midpoint by approximately 80% year-over-year from historically low volumes in 2020. India was not only severely impacted by the pandemic last year, but also from the transition to the BS-VI emission standard. In the South American market, we expect production in a range of 90,000 to 100,000 units, reflecting relatively stable levels as compared to last year. Let's turn to Slide 11 for our fiscal 2021 outlook. Given the market assumptions we just reviewed, we are forecasting sales to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.35 billion. Our revenue guidance does include approximately $75 million in lower aftermarket revenue from the termination of our distribution arrangement with WABCO. However, this is expected to be more than offset by over $100 million of new business wins that we will expect to be in the P&L this year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 9.2% to 10.2%. We anticipate converting a greater than 20% on increased volumes and new business wins due to continued performance and net cost reductions we executed in 2020, which will more than offset higher expected incentive compensation this year. We expect to convert at these levels even while we continue to invest in electrification, which we anticipate at $25 million to $30 million, which is higher than what we spent in 2020. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is in the range of $1.10 to $1.75. Keep in mind, our expected adjusted earnings per share is negatively impacted by about $0.15 over 2020 due to higher expected interest expense as a result of the liquidity actions we executed in June. And finally, we expect to generate $60 million to $100 million of free cash flow, resulting in a conversion rate of 75%, consistent with our M2022 target. Next, I will provide you an update on our progress towards our M2022 targets beginning with new business wins on Slide 12. Our current expectation for fiscal year 2022 is we will exceed our target of $300 million of new business wins by more than $150 million. Several key developments are driving this outperformance. Our acquisition of AxleTech, which provides diversification from our linehaul markets is expected to provide between $175 million to $200 million of revenue in 2022. Additionally, we have been able to win new business in both our commercial truck and aftermarket industrial segments. We are winning new business in every market we serve and across our product portfolio, including in air disc brakes, drivelines and specialty axles for off-highway and defense. And as we go into production with our 14Xe electric powertrain in 2021, we expect revenue will continue to expand in this growing business for us. Now let's turn to the remaining financial targets on the next page. We are confident in our path for achieving a 12.5% adjusted EBITDA margin by converting on incremental revenue from global markets and new business wins at greater than 20%. We expect to deliver strong operational performance from reduced material costs, structural cost savings, footprint optimization and further investments to drive automation and efficiency. We also are on track to meet our free cash flow conversion target of 75%, driven by disciplined and focused working capital management. Our cumulative free cash flow generation for the M2022 3-year plan is coming in lower, however, than our original assumptions due to the pandemic. As a result, this is impacting the amount of future share repurchase activity and our ability to deliver the $4 EPS target. However, we still expect to achieve earnings per share of $3.40 to $3.60, even with these headwinds. Overall, we are on track to achieve or exceed 3 out of the 4 of our M2022 financial targets. Now I will turn the call back over to Jay for some closing remarks.\nJay Craig : Thanks, Carl. Now let's turn to Slide 14. As you heard today, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and exceptional execution. We earned new business, manage costs aggressively and extended relationships with important customers. And we are now preparing to begin the next step in our transition from prototype to production of the next-generation powertrain. We look forward to our continued journey in fiscal 2021. Now we'll take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital.\nJames Picariello: Jay, congrats on the decision. And Chris, of course, congrats to you as well.\nJay Craig: Thanks a lot, Jim.\nJames Picariello: Just on the key bridge items to FY '21 EBITDA, what are the incremental permanent savings you expect to achieve this upcoming year? And to what extent does the unwind of this past year's temporary cost actions present a headwind or an offset?\nCarl Anderson: Yes. James, it's Carl. On the run rate savings we expect to achieve from the reductions we executed last year, it's about $30 million. And if you look at the impact that we had in 2020, we had about $20 million to $23 million associated with just kind of the temporary salary reductions. And we also had a benefit from some of the headcount actions that we took in the last quarter of the year. So run rate, $30 million as we go forward. In addition, this year, we also have some other more temporary discretion cost reductions that we are planning for as well, which is about $10 million.\nJames Picariello: Okay. And that last part, is that tied to the aftermarket industrial restructuring that you announced this morning? Or is that something separate?\nCarl Anderson: No, that would be separate. So -- and then if you think about that as far as, as Jay alluded to, we do expect to have run rate savings, which really will begin in 2022. But for this year, in '21, it's a little bit of a headwind because we do have some expense that we will incur as a result of those actions.\nJames Picariello: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And on the new business wins, encouraging to see the raised target, right, to greater than $450 million versus the original $300 million. I know AxleTech probably takes care of most of that original $300 million. And did I hear correctly you expect to realize $100 million in new business wins this year in FY '21 as incremental to the P&L?\nCarl Anderson: That is correct on the last point, yes.\nJames Picariello: Okay. So the pipeline, the EV pipeline, I think last quarter, the pipeline was maybe $500 million and you had in backlog bookings $200 million. Are those the right numbers? And have they changed at all?\nCarl Anderson: I think that's still directionally the right numbers as you think about what we have for electrification at this point.\nJay Craig: And I think, James, we're estimating for 2022, we should have approximately $100 million of incremental revenue for electrification.\nJames Picariello: Right. Okay. So maybe the $200 million is more like $300 million? Or we could...\nJay Craig: No, of that pipeline, what will be realized in 2022 will be about $100 million.\nJames Picariello: Understood. Understood. Got it. Last one for me. The fact that receivable I think you might have $75 million left to recover, correct me if I'm wrong. And just from an industry volume standpoint in Europe, what would be needed to fully recover that amount? I mean is it a 450,000 unit number? How should we think about that?\nCarl Anderson: It's a good question. I think in order to pull a recovery, it would be probably closer to the 400,000 type of production range.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.\nBrian Johnson: Yes. Congratulations again. Carl, I want to first talk about the air disc brake business. What part of the commercial truck business is breaks? Is that relevant going forward for electric trucks, what are the puts and takes with regen brakes? And are you active to regen index? And then kind of finally, now that WABCO is integrated into ZF, does that change the competitive landscape at all?\nChris Villavarayan: Brian, this is Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that question. So in terms of our portfolio, somewhere about 1/3 to 40% of our business is our brake business. And it is integral. And if you think about it, obviously, even with electrification, air disc brakes are needed, and so it is an integral portion of our business. So the win is very significant as we see it. Going forward, you will always need disc brakes even with regen braking, you do need a secondary form of protection, and that's what the disc brakes provide.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. And in terms of the competitive landscape, does it change at all with WABCO? Because I remember in the distant past, I think you had the Roadranger JV together. Just maybe update us on how that changes anything in terms of your competitive position in brakes?\nChris Villavarayan: No, it doesn't change any of the competitive position. And in terms of this specific win, it's specific to the North American market. And so we don't see that as having any impact.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. And in terms of the new revenue target, it's a bit higher than in M22, okay AxleTech comes in, but also, I think your original targeted same 250,000 Class 8 market. So where should we think about starting -- should we start at $4.1 billion and work our way up and down based on end markets? Or are there other kind of revenue puts and takes we should be thinking about?\nCarl Anderson: Yes. Brian, it's a good question. Yes, I think relative to what we originally laid out in our Analyst Day back in 2018, we had about $3.95 billion of revenue. We are coming out ahead on the new business wins, as we outlined. But relative to that, we do have some FX headwinds associated with that about $100 million, and we also have some lower market assumptions, if you think, especially in India as well as in China. So I think the revenue line item, all in is still around what we originally planned for, which is around that $3.9 billion, $3.95 billion range.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. And then final question, great slide on Daimler. But just light vehicles were all obsessed with the potential for OEMs to in-source e-driveline activities. Can you just recap -- Daimler is one of the more integrated Class 8 players on the -- with Detroit diesel, for example. Do you expect this to be a very long-term contract? Or do you expect to somehow transition this technology to more of a component supply and have them manufacture it?\nChris Villavarayan: So Brian, let me take that question again. It's Chris Villavarayan. I think when you think about it, we've had a very long relationship with Daimler. And if you think through the strategy that both companies have had over the past 10 years, that strategy has existed and we've worked well through that. And through the market cycles up and down, we've managed to maintain or even with that growth share. And so I don't see this dynamic changing. If anything, I think this agreement brings us both together and closer. And so we do see it as a great win capping on what Jay talked about with respect to how we have done on the quality and the delivery standpoint over the last 2 years. And we can build off that through 2027.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. And congratulations again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital.\nJoseph Spak: I'll extend my congrats again as well. Carl, maybe just a first question, and thanks for all the color. I'm trying to sort of follow along at home here. It seems like with all the different puts and takes you mentioned in terms of incremental restructuring and costs coming back and the step-up in electrification investment that underlying incrementals on just the volume portion is still in that 15% to 20%. Is that roughly correct?\nCarl Anderson: I think, Joe, it's probably closer to the upper end of that range, but that is directionally correct. And then obviously, from that point, if you layer in the cost savings that are now more permanent,as well as the footprint optimization, that's what drives the incremental conversions north of 20% as we go forward.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. On the '21 guide, just on the industry outlook, I think you're below some recent third-party forecasts that were just revised higher. Is that just some typical Meritor management prudence or is there something you're seeing...\nJay Craig: No. I think, Joe, those estimates by the industry analytic firms have been extremely volatile. You've seen people changing them almost on a weekly basis. And as you would expect, that wide range of guidance is how we're running the company internally, and we want to be prepared, as Carl said, if there's uptick in the pandemic and unfortunately, required shutdowns, particularly in Europe or North America, we could see those volumes come down from the higher end in towards the midpoint of the lower end. And we want to make sure the company is prepared to operate successfully at that light end to that range. As I told our Board last week, this is probably the most uncertain time in terms of market estimates I've ever seen in my tenure with the company. So we're just trying to make sure we keep all the optionality open for running the company.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. On the new business target, $150 million higher. Can you tell us how much of that incremental $150 million has already been achieved? And how much more is to go? How much of that $150 million is electrification? And also, does it include the additional ePowertrain awards you indicated you expect on Slide 6?\nCarl Anderson: Yes. I think, Joe, as we signaled on the -- just in my prepared remarks, if you think about '21, we are anticipating to have a little bit north of $100 million of new wins coming into P&L that wasn't in last year. If I kind of look at where we ended up last year, we ended up just on total net basis, a little bit less than $100 million. So it really kind of implies we have north of $200 million that will come into '22 in order for us to achieve those targets that we laid out. This is all inclusive of even -- at least to date, some of the electrification awards, obviously, if we're successful in the near future with adding some others that will be incremental.\nJoseph Spak: And then one last...\nChris Villavarayan: And a good way to think about that last part, Joe, is that the electrification portion, as Jay pointed out, would be about $100 million in 2022.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. Last one for me, just on the '22 margin bridge. You still say, a portion of that's from normalized global markets. And Jay, I appreciate your comment that it seems more uncertain than ever. But it seems like at least North America, even what you're talking for '21 is pretty close to $250 million, which I think is really normalized. So is it fair to say that, that margin bridge unless North America goes in excess of normalized is really dependent on international markets?\nCarl Anderson: I think it's -- Joe, yes, I mean, if you look at what we're expecting, we are looking for increases in Brazil, India. We also are planning for the additional new business wins as well as what we're -- in Europe as well. So it is really outside of North America that we expect to really generate the incremental revenue in '22.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.\nRyan Brinkman: Just relative to the $6 million headwind to commercial truck EBITDA in 3Q from electrification initiatives, are you able to quantify the extent to which those costs -- what costs either on an absolute level or a year-over-year basis are maybe factored into the '21 guide? And then just taking a step back from that, too. I recall you in the past saying that ultimately, you expect electrification to be accretive to margin, including I imagine because you're providing more value-add technology, et cetera. Should we think about the incrementals for electrification associated revenue tracking above the sort of more normal-ish 20% conversion? And then as you get those higher incrementals and they compare to the investments, at what point in time and what year do you think is it 2022, et cetera, after the ePowertrain launches, et cetera, that ultimately, the electrification business does become accretive to the overall all-in margin?\nCarl Anderson: Ryan, thanks for the questions. As it relates to just on the cost actions, if you think about it, it's probably best to think about it on a year-over-year basis. We did have about $30 million of cost actions that affected and came into the P&L in fiscal '20. I would say 2/3 of that was really along temporary cost actions and salary reductions, with 1/3 of that being more permanent in the actions we executed back in the late third quarter for us. As a result, if you kind of flip into '21, on a run rate basis, we do expect about $30 million of cost savings from all of those headcount reduction actions we executed. In addition, we are also planning for about $10 million of, I would say, other cost items as well for next year. And then on your electrification question, I think we're still kind of in the ramp-up mode. As Jay articulated, we are beginning production this in '21, a little bit later in a couple of months. And then obviously, we're going to be ramping up through '22 and then beyond. So I think our expectation is this will be accretive at some point, but I would say, over the next couple of years, we're still going to be kind of in ramp-up mode and will be a little bit of a headwind for us.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just relative to capital allocation, I think I heard you say, is that right that you'd be starting to repay debt in the back half of next year? And also just comments on capital expenditure outlook? Is it a little bit less than in recent years? And how should we think about that trending in light of electrification investments impacting EBITDA, too? And then how do you weigh the debt paydown versus you've been buying back shares in recent years in terms of priority, et cetera?\nCarl Anderson: Yes. As it relates to capital allocation, we are committed to ensure we maintain our strong BB credit metrics. And as you think about -- as we think about the current leverage, it's obviously inflated this year just due to the absolute drop in EBITDA dollars. As that kind of comes back, we anticipate to grow back into the balance sheet and be able to have those type of BB credit metrics as we go forward. We are planning, though, in the second half of the year to repay some debt in order to ensure we accelerate that path. And then as we kind of get into '22, we will be looking at again as far as allocating capital to share buybacks. We'll be assessing that at that point. And then on your capital expenditures questions, it's about $85 million, very similar to what we did last year. That's something that as the year goes on, we'll continue to take a look at. But we tend to, as you know, have CapEx as a percent of revenue, somewhere between the 2.7% to 3% range, and we're very comfortable in that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi.\nItay Michaeli: Jay, Chris, congrats to you both. Carl, just to follow-on the prior question, just to clarify, with the fiscal '22 free cash conversion outlook today, does that still translate just to over the original kind of $200 million plus you guided to originally in 2018?\nCarl Anderson: It's pretty close to that, Itay. When you do the quick math on that, I think it points to about $190 million, but yes, it's right around that range.\nItay Michaeli: Great. And then as we think about just the new business progress and kind of how we think about maybe margins beyond markets normalizing. What's a good way to think about incremental margins, specifically on new business going forward?\nJay Craig: I think it depends, Itay, on which segment it comes through. Certainly, as we see new business coming in through the AxleTech acquisition or in our specialty and off-highway, that would be at the higher end of the margin profile relative to that segment that it resides in with aftermarket. As far as the other truck revenue, new business, we're always striving to have the incremental new business to be at or above what the current business is. And I think you've seen over the last 6 years or so that, that track record has been pretty strong. So it really depends on the mix of that business. And we do have quite a few wins that are in the specialty and off-highway areas. So we could see that segment get a disproportionate share of the new business wins.\nItay Michaeli: That's very helpful. And maybe just lastly, back to the balance sheet, and I apologize if I missed this. Carl, as you kind of -- I think you mentioned earlier, maybe it was Jay that you want to run with a little bit higher cash balances now just given the crisis. Any thoughts that we could think about in terms of how the company wants to run with minimum liquidity or even a leverage target in the next sort of 12 to 18 months?\nJay Craig: I think I'll start off and ask Carl to fill in. Carl did just mention it on a previous question. But remember, our first priority in capital allocation is to maintain our strong BB credit metrics. We believe that has served us and investors extremely well over the last 6 to 9 months as we've been through this crisis. And it has validated our belief that, that's a critical benchmark for us to maintain. So that will be the first and foremost goal in the capital allocation and then as you've seen historically with us, we do not let cash sit idly on our balance sheet, but we'll deploy any excess cash beyond that in shareholder-friendly ways.\nOperator: I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for closing remarks.\nTodd Chirillo: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jay Craig",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Before we review our results, I would like to take a moment to address the leadership transition plan we announced last week. After nearly 6 years as CEO, I will transition to the role of Executive Chairman of the Board on February 28. At that time, Chris Villavarayan, our Chief Operating Officer, has been selected to succeed me as Meritor's next CEO and President. Additionally, Bill Newlin, our current Chairman, will become the lead Director of the Board. Since I assumed the CEO position, we have made great strides through execution of our M2016, M2019 and now our M2022 plans. We have advanced our innovation and product portfolio, strengthened our financial foundation and created a collaborative and diverse organization that fosters growth. M2022 is well underway and we are seeing signs of recovery in our business and industry since the onset of COVID-19, which I'll touch upon more later. That said, we believe now is the ideal time to set in motion our long-term succession plan. Many of you know Chris, who has been lit Meritor for more than 2 decades and is an integral member of our leadership team. He has had a significant impact on our company during his tenure, and this transition represents a natural next step. On a personal note, Chris has been a true partner to me, helping to execute our successful and plans. In the months ahead, I will continue to lead Meritor and work closely with Chris as we prepare for a smooth transition. Now let's turn to our results on Slide 3. Obviously, our fourth quarter and full year results were unfavorably impacted by lower volumes due to the pandemic. However, we were able to partly offset the impact on our margin for the quarter and for the year, with the cost-reduction actions we implemented in the second half. Carl will give you more detail on the results, but the important takeaway here is the extent to which we are able to preserve our financial stability, considering the significance of the headwind created by COVID-19. As you see in the center of the slide, we're able to execute well on an approximate 50% increase in sales sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth, with a conversion rate of 22%. All things considered, we recovered from the crisis exceptionally well. We took aggressive actions to protect the company financially, and most importantly, we took immediate steps to protect our employees while it worked. While certain countries and states where we have operations are experiencing rising case counts, we remain fully operational globally with no limitations at this time. Let's turn to Slide 4. While the pandemic required a great deal of management attention in 2020, we still had many achievements that support all aspects of M2022. Our safety, quality and delivery metrics were excellent. With regard to safety, the total recordable case rate was 0.57 per 200,000 hours worked with more than 50% of our facilities reporting 0 recordables for the year. We believe this makes us one of the safest global manufacturers in the world. This speaks volumes for our team's commitment to each other and is certainly one of the accomplishments I am most proud of during my tenure. We are honored to receive Daimler's coveted Global Supplier Award this year for providing more than 1 million axles, brakes and drive lines, with excellent quality and parts per million rates during the peak 2019 North American market. In addition, we are able to repurchase 10.4 million shares in fiscal 2020, were added to the S&P 600 SmallCap Index and announced 4 footprint actions, 3 in the United States and 1 in Europe. We expect these actions to generate annual run rate savings of approximately $10 million and give us added confidence to achieving our M2022 objectives. In July, we celebrated production of our 100 millionth remanufactured brake shoe. With nearly 50% of remanufactured brake shoe production in North America, Meritor is the industry leader. We continue to win new business with important customers and later in the discussion, Carl will review our expected outperformance against the M2022 new business target. And finally, we received approval from our Board for an incremental $30 million to industrialize medium and heavy applications for our ePowertrain portfolio, more on that in a moment. On Slide 5, you will see additional detail related to the long-term agreement we signed with Daimler. This is an important contract for us that extends our relationship with Daimler through 2027 and will now put Meritor in standard position for air disc brakes on the Freightliner Cascadia through 2025. Let's look at Slide 6 for an update on electrification. Essentially, the takeaway here is that we will be in production with our electric powertrain in 2021. The picture on this slide was taken recently at our EE powertrain assembly operation. We are very excited that we are only months away from delivering under the contract we secured with PACCAR for its heavy-duty electric trucks. In advance of production, the 14Xe is already receiving industry acclaim. Earlier this year, we told you we were recognized as a 2020 PACEpilot Honoree by Automotive News for our Blue Horizon electrification solutions. And recently, Meritor received the Diesel Progress Achievement of the Year and Electric Application of the Year awards. We believe we will be the first supplier to begin production of electric powertrains for Class 8 electric vehicles, and we anticipate additional production contracts in 2021. Let's go to the next slide. As you know, customers have numerous electric drivetrain solutions to consider. We are often asked about the remote mount architecture versus the electric powertrain. Meritor's electric powertrain is revolutionary and that we are taking an electric motor and a multi-speed transmission and integrating them into the carrier. We are not just bolting on a motor. This design is fully integrated and designed to maximize efficiency, performance, weight savings and space utilization. By partnering with the leading motor technology companies in the world, we have designed the electric motor from the ground up to meet and exceed customer expectations and performance targets. And since this technology is based on Meritor's traditional 14X axle design manufacturing is easier, and OEMs can integrate it into existing chassis using the same mounting locations and hardware. Although we are prepared to deliver e-optimized axles for remote mount solutions, Meritor's class-leading integrated powertrain architecture is beginning to be the product of choice within the commercial vehicle industry. We believe we've developed the most advanced electric powertrain for medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles in the industry and that it will be game-changing. On this slide, we have provided the hotlink to meritor.com, where you can get an inside look at the e powertrain production at our plants in addition to a video that shows the differences between the architectures I described. With that, I'll turn the call over to Carl. Thanks, Carl. Now let's turn to Slide 14. As you heard today, we have maintained a strong balance sheet and exceptional execution. We earned new business, manage costs aggressively and extended relationships with important customers. And we are now preparing to begin the next step in our transition from prototype to production of the next-generation powertrain. We look forward to our continued journey in fiscal 2021. Now we'll take your questions. Thanks a lot, Jim. And I think, James, we're estimating for 2022, we should have approximately $100 million of incremental revenue for electrification. No, of that pipeline, what will be realized in 2022 will be about $100 million. No. I think, Joe, those estimates by the industry analytic firms have been extremely volatile. You've seen people changing them almost on a weekly basis. And as you would expect, that wide range of guidance is how we're running the company internally, and we want to be prepared, as Carl said, if there's uptick in the pandemic and unfortunately, required shutdowns, particularly in Europe or North America, we could see those volumes come down from the higher end in towards the midpoint of the lower end. And we want to make sure the company is prepared to operate successfully at that light end to that range. As I told our Board last week, this is probably the most uncertain time in terms of market estimates I've ever seen in my tenure with the company. So we're just trying to make sure we keep all the optionality open for running the company. I think it depends, Itay, on which segment it comes through. Certainly, as we see new business coming in through the AxleTech acquisition or in our specialty and off-highway, that would be at the higher end of the margin profile relative to that segment that it resides in with aftermarket. As far as the other truck revenue, new business, we're always striving to have the incremental new business to be at or above what the current business is. And I think you've seen over the last 6 years or so that, that track record has been pretty strong. So it really depends on the mix of that business. And we do have quite a few wins that are in the specialty and off-highway areas. So we could see that segment get a disproportionate share of the new business wins. I think I'll start off and ask Carl to fill in. Carl did just mention it on a previous question. But remember, our first priority in capital allocation is to maintain our strong BB credit metrics. We believe that has served us and investors extremely well over the last 6 to 9 months as we've been through this crisis. And it has validated our belief that, that's a critical benchmark for us to maintain. So that will be the first and foremost goal in the capital allocation and then as you've seen historically with us, we do not let cash sit idly on our balance sheet, but we'll deploy any excess cash beyond that in shareholder-friendly ways."

            "name": "Chris Villavarayan",
            "content": "Brian, this is Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that question. So in terms of our portfolio, somewhere about 1/3 to 40% of our business is our brake business. And it is integral. And if you think about it, obviously, even with electrification, air disc brakes are needed, and so it is an integral portion of our business. So the win is very significant as we see it. Going forward, you will always need disc brakes even with regen braking, you do need a secondary form of protection, and that's what the disc brakes provide. No, it doesn't change any of the competitive position. And in terms of this specific win, it's specific to the North American market. And so we don't see that as having any impact. So Brian, let me take that question again. It's Chris Villavarayan. I think when you think about it, we've had a very long relationship with Daimler. And if you think through the strategy that both companies have had over the past 10 years, that strategy has existed and we've worked well through that. And through the market cycles up and down, we've managed to maintain or even with that growth share. And so I don't see this dynamic changing. If anything, I think this agreement brings us both together and closer. And so we do see it as a great win capping on what Jay talked about with respect to how we have done on the quality and the delivery standpoint over the last 2 years. And we can build off that through 2027. And a good way to think about that last part, Joe, is that the electrification portion, as Jay pointed out, would be about $100 million in 2022."

            "name": "Carl Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results, provide fiscal year 2021 outlook and provide an update on our M2022 financial goals. Now let's walk through our financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 8. First, I will review our segment results for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck decreased by just over $200 million year-over-year. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower volumes in most markets due to COVID-19. While volumes were down year-over-year, we did see production increase throughout the quarter as we began to recover from the shutdowns earlier in the year. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $24 million, down $48 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 4.3%, down 500 basis points from a year ago. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily by lower market volumes. In addition, we increased our electrification spend by $6 million compared to last year. This was partially offset by cost-reduction actions primarily executed in the second half of the year, lower incentive compensation and operational performance. Aftermarket industrial sales were $226 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, down 22% compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by lower volumes in our North America aftermarket specialty and defense businesses. Aftermarket sales were also negatively impacted by $36 million due to the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. While revenues were lower, segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 15% from 14.2% in the prior year. The margin increase was driven by cost-reduction actions, lower incentive compensation and operational performance, which more than offset lower volume. For the full year, revenue came in just north of $3 billion, down 31% from the same period last year. The revenue decrease was driven primarily by lower market volumes across our segments due to COVID-19. Net income from continuing operations attributable to the company was $244 million compared to $290 million in the prior year. We did incur $27 million of restructuring expense in 2020 due to the headcount reduction programs executed throughout the year. This was partially offset by $203 million of after-tax income associated with the termination of the company's distribution arrangement in fiscal year 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was $272 million in fiscal year 2020, translating to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.9%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.12, down from $3.82 in the prior year. Finally, free cash flow is $180 million in 2020. This does include the benefit of $265 million in cash received from the termination of the distribution arrangement. Excluding this impact, free cash flow was negative $85 million for the full year. Keep in mind, this includes the impact from our factoring programs that were down $77 million this year due primarily from lower European revenue. As markets begin to recover, this will be a tailwind for free cash flow as we move forward. Next, I'll review our key balance sheet metrics on Slide 9. We ended the fiscal year with a strong liquidity position of over $1 billion, which is up almost $200 million from last year. Our cash on hand is $315 million, which is more than we typically hold. Given the current environment, we believe it is prudent to run higher cash balances at this time. Our funded status and our pension plans also significantly improved, and we are now in a net global overfunding status on our plans. It is important to note that we achieved this milestone without any cash contributions over the past several years. Our long-term liability driven investment strategy and strong asset returns drove the increase in the funding status. Moving to our debt maturity profile. We have no significant maturities for the next 3 years. We recently called the remaining $23 million of 7.875% convertible debt which upon completion will reduce both our outstanding debt and the share dilution associated with its convertible instrument. Furthermore, our 2024 bonds are currently callable, which provides further flexibility to be opportunistic in managing our debt profile. Additionally, while our leverage is expected to be above our target range in the near term, we do expect to deploy capital to begin to pay down debt in the second half of 2021. Next, I'll review our current global market outlook on Slide 10. You will notice we are giving market ranges wider than our typical guidance. While most global markets point to recovery in 2021, we are prudently planning for a variety of scenarios. In the North America Class 8 market, we are projecting production levels between 215,000 to 255,000 units. We have seen an increase in orders over the last several months, which could point to the upper end of the range. At the same time, some of this recent activity could prove to be transitory given the changing conditions associated with the virus. As we look at our other markets, we anticipate Europe will be in the range of 300,000 to 350,000 units. In addition to the new restrictions currently being imposed in certain European countries, we are also closely monitoring Brexit as we move throughout 2021. For India, we are projecting the market will increase at the midpoint by approximately 80% year-over-year from historically low volumes in 2020. India was not only severely impacted by the pandemic last year, but also from the transition to the BS-VI emission standard. In the South American market, we expect production in a range of 90,000 to 100,000 units, reflecting relatively stable levels as compared to last year. Let's turn to Slide 11 for our fiscal 2021 outlook. Given the market assumptions we just reviewed, we are forecasting sales to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.35 billion. Our revenue guidance does include approximately $75 million in lower aftermarket revenue from the termination of our distribution arrangement with WABCO. However, this is expected to be more than offset by over $100 million of new business wins that we will expect to be in the P&L this year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 9.2% to 10.2%. We anticipate converting a greater than 20% on increased volumes and new business wins due to continued performance and net cost reductions we executed in 2020, which will more than offset higher expected incentive compensation this year. We expect to convert at these levels even while we continue to invest in electrification, which we anticipate at $25 million to $30 million, which is higher than what we spent in 2020. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is in the range of $1.10 to $1.75. Keep in mind, our expected adjusted earnings per share is negatively impacted by about $0.15 over 2020 due to higher expected interest expense as a result of the liquidity actions we executed in June. And finally, we expect to generate $60 million to $100 million of free cash flow, resulting in a conversion rate of 75%, consistent with our M2022 target. Next, I will provide you an update on our progress towards our M2022 targets beginning with new business wins on Slide 12. Our current expectation for fiscal year 2022 is we will exceed our target of $300 million of new business wins by more than $150 million. Several key developments are driving this outperformance. Our acquisition of AxleTech, which provides diversification from our linehaul markets is expected to provide between $175 million to $200 million of revenue in 2022. Additionally, we have been able to win new business in both our commercial truck and aftermarket industrial segments. We are winning new business in every market we serve and across our product portfolio, including in air disc brakes, drivelines and specialty axles for off-highway and defense. And as we go into production with our 14Xe electric powertrain in 2021, we expect revenue will continue to expand in this growing business for us. Now let's turn to the remaining financial targets on the next page. We are confident in our path for achieving a 12.5% adjusted EBITDA margin by converting on incremental revenue from global markets and new business wins at greater than 20%. We expect to deliver strong operational performance from reduced material costs, structural cost savings, footprint optimization and further investments to drive automation and efficiency. We also are on track to meet our free cash flow conversion target of 75%, driven by disciplined and focused working capital management. Our cumulative free cash flow generation for the M2022 3-year plan is coming in lower, however, than our original assumptions due to the pandemic. As a result, this is impacting the amount of future share repurchase activity and our ability to deliver the $4 EPS target. However, we still expect to achieve earnings per share of $3.40 to $3.60, even with these headwinds. Overall, we are on track to achieve or exceed 3 out of the 4 of our M2022 financial targets. Now I will turn the call back over to Jay for some closing remarks. Yes. James, it's Carl. On the run rate savings we expect to achieve from the reductions we executed last year, it's about $30 million. And if you look at the impact that we had in 2020, we had about $20 million to $23 million associated with just kind of the temporary salary reductions. And we also had a benefit from some of the headcount actions that we took in the last quarter of the year. So run rate, $30 million as we go forward. In addition, this year, we also have some other more temporary discretion cost reductions that we are planning for as well, which is about $10 million. No, that would be separate. So -- and then if you think about that as far as, as Jay alluded to, we do expect to have run rate savings, which really will begin in 2022. But for this year, in '21, it's a little bit of a headwind because we do have some expense that we will incur as a result of those actions. That is correct on the last point, yes. I think that's still directionally the right numbers as you think about what we have for electrification at this point. It's a good question. I think in order to pull a recovery, it would be probably closer to the 400,000 type of production range. Yes. Brian, it's a good question. Yes, I think relative to what we originally laid out in our Analyst Day back in 2018, we had about $3.95 billion of revenue. We are coming out ahead on the new business wins, as we outlined. But relative to that, we do have some FX headwinds associated with that about $100 million, and we also have some lower market assumptions, if you think, especially in India as well as in China. So I think the revenue line item, all in is still around what we originally planned for, which is around that $3.9 billion, $3.95 billion range. I think, Joe, it's probably closer to the upper end of that range, but that is directionally correct. And then obviously, from that point, if you layer in the cost savings that are now more permanent,as well as the footprint optimization, that's what drives the incremental conversions north of 20% as we go forward. Yes. I think, Joe, as we signaled on the -- just in my prepared remarks, if you think about '21, we are anticipating to have a little bit north of $100 million of new wins coming into P&L that wasn't in last year. If I kind of look at where we ended up last year, we ended up just on total net basis, a little bit less than $100 million. So it really kind of implies we have north of $200 million that will come into '22 in order for us to achieve those targets that we laid out. This is all inclusive of even -- at least to date, some of the electrification awards, obviously, if we're successful in the near future with adding some others that will be incremental. I think it's -- Joe, yes, I mean, if you look at what we're expecting, we are looking for increases in Brazil, India. We also are planning for the additional new business wins as well as what we're -- in Europe as well. So it is really outside of North America that we expect to really generate the incremental revenue in '22. Ryan, thanks for the questions. As it relates to just on the cost actions, if you think about it, it's probably best to think about it on a year-over-year basis. We did have about $30 million of cost actions that affected and came into the P&L in fiscal '20. I would say 2/3 of that was really along temporary cost actions and salary reductions, with 1/3 of that being more permanent in the actions we executed back in the late third quarter for us. As a result, if you kind of flip into '21, on a run rate basis, we do expect about $30 million of cost savings from all of those headcount reduction actions we executed. In addition, we are also planning for about $10 million of, I would say, other cost items as well for next year. And then on your electrification question, I think we're still kind of in the ramp-up mode. As Jay articulated, we are beginning production this in '21, a little bit later in a couple of months. And then obviously, we're going to be ramping up through '22 and then beyond. So I think our expectation is this will be accretive at some point, but I would say, over the next couple of years, we're still going to be kind of in ramp-up mode and will be a little bit of a headwind for us. Yes. As it relates to capital allocation, we are committed to ensure we maintain our strong BB credit metrics. And as you think about -- as we think about the current leverage, it's obviously inflated this year just due to the absolute drop in EBITDA dollars. As that kind of comes back, we anticipate to grow back into the balance sheet and be able to have those type of BB credit metrics as we go forward. We are planning, though, in the second half of the year to repay some debt in order to ensure we accelerate that path. And then as we kind of get into '22, we will be looking at again as far as allocating capital to share buybacks. We'll be assessing that at that point. And then on your capital expenditures questions, it's about $85 million, very similar to what we did last year. That's something that as the year goes on, we'll continue to take a look at. But we tend to, as you know, have CapEx as a percent of revenue, somewhere between the 2.7% to 3% range, and we're very comfortable in that. It's pretty close to that, Itay. When you do the quick math on that, I think it points to about $190 million, but yes, it's right around that range."

Third quarter continued a period of high demand volatility across our end markets. Three months ago, we experienced the largest sales decline in the company's history. We have now followed that with the largest sequential increase in sales in the company's history. Even with the dramatic increase, however, sales remained below last year's levels. While we have seen increased demand around most of our end markets over the last three months, we continue to see differences in recovery rates, both by market and by region, and we expect these differences to continue. Our employees have done a remarkable job of supporting our customers through this period while maintaining a safe work environment. In the third quarter, our supply chain organization continue to support near record levels of truck production in China, as well as ramping up production to meet significantly increased demand in the North American heavy duty truck, and pickup market. Our engineering group has continued to successfully launch new products during this period, over the last six months we introduced an entire range of broad stage six products in India, and portions of our National Standard VI portfolio in China. We also recently announced our full product lineup to meet EPA 2021 regulations in North America. While nearly everything about the way we have worked -- we work has changed due to COVID-19, the commitment and capability of our employees has remained intact. Now I'll move to a summary of our third quarter results and a discussion of our major end markets. Mark will then take you through more details of our third quarter financial performance and update you on our balance sheet and liquidity. Revenues for the third quarter of 2020 were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 11%, compared to the third quarter of 2019. EBITDA was $876 million or 17.1%, compared to $958 million or 16.6% a year ago. The impact of lower volumes and higher variable compensation costs was offset by the benefits of restructuring, temporary salary reductions, reduced warranty costs and higher joint venture income. The increase in joint venture income was primarily due to continued strong levels of demand in China. Engine Business revenues declined by 13% in the third quarter compared to a year ago. Lower production in North American truck markets drove most of the revenue decline. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 18.1%, compared to 14.1% for the same period in 2019. Cost savings related to restructuring activities and salary reductions, as well as increased joint venture income, partially offset the impact of lower volumes. Third quarter results also benefited from a VAT recovery in Brazil. Sales for our Distribution segment declined by 14% year-over-year, with lower revenues in domestic and international markets. Third quarter EBITDA was $182 million or 10.6% of sales, compared to 9.3% in the third quarter of 2019. EBITDA margins increased, as we realize more of the benefits of our transformation work in North America. Third quarter revenues for the Components segment declined 7%. Sales in North America declined 24%, driven by lower truck build rates, while revenues in international markets increased by 26%, driven by higher truck demand in China. EBITDA for the third quarter was $261 million or 16.9% compared to 17.3% in the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA percent decreased, as the impact of lower volumes was partially offset by the benefits of restructuring and temporary salary reductions. Power Systems sales in the third quarter declined 13% year-over-year. Industrial sales declined 21%, driven by continued weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. Power Generation sales decreased by 7%, with lower revenues in both North America and international markets. EBITDA in the third quarter was 10.3% or $101 million, compared to 14% a year ago. The impact of lower volumes more than offset the benefits of cost reduction actions. In the New Power business, sales of $18 million were double those from a year ago. EBITDA was a loss of $40 million, in line with our expectations. Now I will comment on some of our key regions and markets, starting with North America, and then I\u2019ll cover some of our largest international markets. Our third quarter revenues in North America declined 18% to $3 billion, but increased by 49% sequentially. Compared to last year, we experienced lower demand in both on and off highway markets, as well as within our parts and service business. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks declined 35% in the third quarter, compared to a year ago, but rose 119% sequentially. Year-to-date, our market share is 33%, driven by the continued strong performance of our products in the field. Production of medium-duty trucks decreased by 33% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, but increased 76% from second quarter levels. We continue to maintain our clear market share leadership in the medium-duty truck market, with over 80% of new trucks powered by Cummins power trains in 2020. Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased 4% compared to a year ago, and included a catch-up in production by our OEM partner after an extended second quarter shut down. Demand in domestic bus markets remain weak in the third quarter with sales down, 24%, driven by demand lower demand from both transit and school bus customers. In domestic, our highway market engine sales for construction equipment decreased by 47%, driven by lower demand by rental fleets who went through a significant replenishment cycle in 2018 and 2019. Revenues for power generation equipment fell by 7% with lower demand and backup power market. Demand for engines and oil and gas markets declined by 80%. Now I'll turn to our international markets. International revenues were flat in the third quarter of 2020, compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $1.7 billion, an increase of 46%, compared to a year ago, driven by continued strong demand in both truck and construction markets. And the third quarter industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in China, increased by 74% compared to a year ago. While demand declines sequentially, which is normal in the third quarter for China. Total industry production with the highest on record for any third quarter. Demand continues to be driven by improved levels of freight activity and government policies, supporting the scrapping of old NSV trucks. Our market share was 17% in the quarter, up from 16% in the third quarter of 2019, driven by increased truck market share of our partner Foton, along with higher utilization of our engine in Foton trucks, which now stands at over 80%. Industry sales of light duty trucks, increased by 49% in the third quarter, and our market share was 9%, up from 7% last year, our increased market share was driven by improved truck market share Foton, as well as increased use of our engines and JC, while new NSX regulations come into effect for all markets in China next July, there are certain cities and applications where these regulations are already in place. 12 of our NSX engine models are now in production, including our entire light duty portfolio, as well as our leading 6.7 and 12 liter products. We've shipped over 50,000 NSX compliant units so far in 2020 and are seeing strong acceptance of our new engines. In addition, we are now selling our automated manual transmissions into the Chinese market, and are on track to sell over 1000 Endurant AMTs by the end of the year. Third quarter demand for excavators in China, increased by 57% from a year ago. The central government is encouraging increased levels of borrowing by local municipalities to support investment in infrastructure and housing projects. So far this year over $500 billion in local government loans have been issued, targeting infrastructure projects and resulting in increased excavator demand. Our market share was 16% this quarter compared to 15% a year ago, driven by the strong performance of our domestic OEM customers. Demand for power generation equipment in China was flat compared to a year ago with increased demands on data center customers offset by weaker demand for standby power. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $295 million, a reduction of 14% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck sales in India decreased 47%. While power generation sales declined by 45%. While demand in India remains at very low levels. It's the industry truck sales more than triple compared to second quarter levels. While credit availability remains tight, certain segments of the truck market, especially those tied to construction are seeing a recovery in demand driven by state government stimulus for infrastructure. Cummins is well positioned to benefit from our recovery in Indian markets. Both because of our leading market position, as well as the incremental content we have on engines that meet BSVI on-highway emission standards, which became effective in April. Outside of India and China, we saw a year-over-year revenue declines of 8% in Europe, and 15% in Latin America, primarily due to lower truck production, compared to the second quarter sales \u2013 compared to the second quarter sales increased by 25% in Europe, and increased by 102% in Latin America, as OEMs resumed truck production in both regions. Global sales of mining engines declined 39% compared to a year ago. Demand remains stable among copper and iron ore miners, while sales related to coal mining remained low. I also wanted to discuss our aftermarket revenues during this quarter. Sales of parts declined by 12% in our engine business and 14% in our Power Systems business. Part sales remain depressed in our Power Systems business, due to low demand in oil and gas markets, as well as lower rebuild activity in mining markets. In our engine business, parts sales were down 12% year-over-year for increased 20% sequentially. Compared to last year, we are seeing weaker demand in bus markets and parts for older model trucks. Parts demand for current on-highway truck engines are flat with last year. While demand increased from second quarter levels across most of our end markets, we remain cautious about future demand increases due to the continued spread of COVID-19 in most countries outside of Asia. And while we are encouraged by continued strong demand in China and improving fundamentals in North American truck markets, industry backlogs remain at modest levels. We currently expect consolidated company revenues in the fourth quarter to be similar to third quarter levels, with higher demand in North American truck markets and continued improvement in aftermarket sales, partially offset by lower demand in China. We continue to expect that the pace of market recovery will differ from region-to-region and may change based on government actions, both to control the spread of COVID-19 or to stimulate their economies and build business and consumer confidence. We continue working hard to support our end users and build our \u2013 build strong OEM relationships during this period. In August, we announced the extension of our medium and heavy-duty truck engine partnership with Navistar. Cummins will continue to supply engines for Navistar's medium and heavy-duty trucks as well as for bus applications through the end of 2026, extending our 80-year relationship with Navistar. Through the development and introduction of new products, we continue to reduce the emissions levels of our products while increasing fuel economy. This includes the launch of our full product lineup for 2021 EPA regulations in North America and NSVI regulations in China and BSVI regulations in India. We are encouraged by the performance and market acceptance of these products that are already in the field. We also continue to focus on supporting our customers in their transition to carbon-neutral technologies. Our revenues doubled in our new Power Segment this quarter, and we are excited to share more about how we expect our hydrogen production and fuel cell business to develop at Cummins Hydrogen Day on November 16. We hope you all will be able to attend this virtual event. Now let me turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial performance this quarter, including our record operating cash flow. Mark?\nMark Smith: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I would like you to leave this call with two key takeaways from our financial performance in the third quarter. Number one, we delivered solid decremental margins in the third quarter, which put us on track for full year performance that will extend our record of raising profitability over successive downturns. This performance is a testament to our operational flexibility, ramping down effectively in the second quarter and then converting additional volume into stronger earnings and record operating cash flow in the third quarter. Number two is a result of the record operating cash flows and the addition of low-cost, long-term financing in the third quarter, the company sits today with strong liquidity, which will allow us to keep investing in our future in the face of any further volatility and return any excess capital to shareholders in the future. Now, let me share some of the key details of our third quarter. Third quarter revenues were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 11% from a year ago. Sales in North America fell 18%, and international revenues were flat. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%, primarily due to a weaker Brazilian real. Earnings before interest and taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $876 million or 17.1% of sales for the quarter, compared to $958 million or 16.6% of sales a year ago, representing a decremental EBITDA of 13%. EBITDA dollars decreased by $82 million over the third quarter last year, driven by the negative impact of lower sales, partially offset by the benefits of prior restructuring actions, temporary salary reductions, lower warranty and material costs and increased joint venture income in China. During the quarter, we recorded a recovery of previously expensed value-added taxes in Brazil, which boosted revenues and pre-tax earnings by $44 million and primarily benefited the engine business. The variable compensation expense in the third quarter was higher than a year ago as we increased our accrual, reflecting higher expectations for full year company profitability than we anticipated three months ago. For the full year 2020, variable compensation is projected to be lower than 2019. Gross margin of $1.3 billion, or 26.4% of sales, increased by 50 basis points from a year ago. Lower base compensation expense due to the benefits of restructuring actions, temporary salary cuts, material cost reductions and the VAT recovery in Brazil, more than offset the impact of lower sales and higher variable compensation expense. As a reminder, our gross margin last year was negatively impacted by $37 million in pre-tax charges, as we exited two unprofitable product lines. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $67 million or 11% due to the benefits of restructuring, temporary salary reductions and reduced discretionary expenses, partially offset by the increased overall compensation. Research expenses decreased by $18 million or 7% from a year ago, but increased by $35 million or 19% from the second quarter, as expected, as we ramped up work at our global technical centers and continued progress on engineering programs following some disruption to operations in the second quarter. Joint venture income increased by $30 million, but driven by continued strong demand for trucks in China, and joint venture income in China was a record for the third quarter, as we converted those higher volumes into strong earnings. Other income of $21 million decreased by $40 million compared to a year ago. Last year, we recognized a onetime $35 million cash gain related to the company's foreign exchange hedging program, which did not repeat this year. Net earnings for the quarter were $501 million or $3.36 per diluted share compared to $622 million or $3.97 a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.5%, and income tax expense included unfavorable discrete items of $31 million or $0.21 per diluted share.  After a tough second quarter, operating cash flow rebounded to a record inflow of $1.2 billion in the third quarter, driven by strong profitability and lower working capital levels. Our inventory decreased by $185 million in the quarter, even as sales increased 33% from second quarter levels. Capital expenditures was $116 million in the quarter, down from $153 million a year ago. We expect full year capital expenditures to be in the range of $500 million to $525 million, unchanged from our prior guidance and down more than 25% from 2019. We continue to return cash to shareholders in the third quarter with $194 million of cash dividends paid out. In August, the company completed an aggregate $2 billion debt offering of 5, 10 and 30-year maturities, taking advantage of extremely attractive long-term interest rates that reflected both favorable market conditions and our own strong credit rating. This long-term financing was used in part to pay down our commercial paper borrowings and reduces our reliance on credit facilities going forward. Company's long-term credit ratings remain unchanged at A+ from Standard and Poor's and A2 from Moody's with stable outlooks  As a result of our strong operating cash flow and the debt offering, we boosted our total liquidity to $6.5 billion at the end of September, which puts Cummins in a strong position to navigate any further volatility that may lie ahead. In October, we announced an increase to our quarterly cash dividend, our 11th straight year of dividend growth. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues to remain similar to third quarter levels. Strong industry orders are expected to lead to strong demand in North American truck markets and improved aftermarket demand. India has shown some signs of improvement from very low levels in demand as the lockdowns have been eased and some economic activities increasing. In China, where demand has been at record levels over the last 6 months, we expect to experience some seasonal declines in the fourth quarter, but demand remained at relatively strong levels. The temporary salary reduction that went into effect in mid-April ended at the end of September as planned. The restoration of salaries will add approximately $90 million of pretax expenses in the fourth quarter. In summary, we delivered a strong set of results in the third quarter, including record operating cash flow. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their dedication and commitment to excellence through these last 6 very challenging months. Following unprecedented decline in demand in the second quarter, we responded well in ramping back up in the third quarter, supporting our customers and maintaining financial discipline throughout. While many of our markets have improved, the effects of the pandemic can still be felt in many regions and may impact the pace of recovery. We will continue to align our business with market conditions, deliver strong operational performance, invest in the technologies that will fuel profitable growth and return any excess capital to shareholders. Finally, as Tom previously mentioned, we'll be holding our Hydrogen Day on November 16th, where we will highlight our participation in hydrogen economy. Additional details and registration can be found on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today and your interest in Cummins. Now let me turn it back to James.\nJames Hopkins: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a related follow-up, and if you have additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're now ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nStephen Volkmann: Thank you.\nMark Smith: Hello?\nStephen Volkmann: Can you guys hear me okay?\nMark Smith: Yeah, obviously.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay, good. Sorry. So yeah, my question, maybe this is a Mark question, I don't know, but I'm trying to just see if I can disaggregate your temporary cost activities from your restructuring benefits? And obviously, I'm trying to start to think about 2021 and figure out what you get to keep and kind of what you have to give back. Can you give us some help with that?\nMark Smith: You'll remember that we implemented a temporary salary reductions in the middle of April, Steve. So when you do the math, it's about $165 million of full year lower expenses in 2020. Obviously, that will not repeat. We've restored those salaries in the fourth quarter. The restructuring, I mean, is embedded in our solid decremental margins. And again, we don't have any further major restructuring actions in place, but we have captured the benefits of that $250 million to $300 million in the current year as anticipated.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay. I guess what -- that's sort of where I'm trying to go, Mark, is how should we think about incremental margins, assuming there's some small increment next year? Low decrementals, kind of maybe employ low incrementals, but maybe not if you're getting a good chunk of restructuring benefits.\nMark Smith: Yeah. I think, just at this point, so it's a very -- I understand the question. It's just too early even to assess our market conditions next year. But you will -- you can see from our results today that we're pushing on all the levers, productivity gains that we can. It's just too early beyond the obvious items to comment much on next year.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay, thanks. Worth a try. Appreciate it.\nMark Smith: Thank you.\nJames Hopkins: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nCourtney Yakavonis: Hi, thanks guys. If you can just comment a little bit more on the guidance that 4Q revenues would be similar to 3Q relative to kind of some of the strength we saw in the international markets versus the increases that we're expecting in North America, if you can just help us understand that? And then relative to what you're expecting in parts relative to the engine side? Thanks.\nMark Smith: So the strength in international market, all being flat, lower down to China, right. There really wasn't any strength to speak of elsewhere in terms of year-over-year growth. There was steady recovery in some markets. But any part of our business that touch China, whether within the component business, even our construction business, within the engine business, data center orders for the power systems, anything that touch China was pretty much up year-over-year. And so that's really what \u2013 you're all flat international revenues for the quarter. It's typical currently that we see some seasonal weakening going into the third \u2013 into the fourth quarter every year in China. So we still expect relative to prior year, strong demand but weaker sequentially, primarily impacting the components business since all \u2013 pretty much all of their revenue was consolidated, and then to a lesser extent, the Engine business. So that's the primary market where we're expecting some seasonal declines. And then yes, truck production build rates, I think, are largely set for the fourth quarter. And then yes, on parts, what we saw in the second quarter was particularly some weaker demand in the bus market, truck parts, particularly on newer model, heavy-duty truck was stable in the third quarter, and we expect steadily improving parts demand in subsequent quarters. The big factor is really China easing, and we're not expecting rapid further acceleration in truck demand right now.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question is coming from Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is now live.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. I guess two questions. First, the margins in the Distribution business improved again in the third quarter. So can you talk about how to think about those margins longer term, sort of what's structural based on some of the internal self-help you guys have been implementing? And then my second question, Mark, understanding you guys are always conservative, but you are sitting with $3 billion or so in cash. So how do you think about cash flow for the year? What's the right number? At what point do we, you know, start to thinking about putting that cash to use? Thanks.\nMark Smith: Good. Yes, so you're right. And I'll start on Distribution, Tony, if you want to chime in. We have had a very focused effort, particularly in North America, on driving margin improvement, a lot of it's coming out of the cost side of the business, this years we've been pleased with the progress this year Jamie. I think then, you know, then we're really looking to see, you know, as parts and service which, you know, have been down, probably more, more than in prior cycles due to the severity of the impact of COVID. How that recovers in future years. So I think, we've made a lot of progress in the margin improvement over the last couple of years. We certainly expect to hang on to that. And then we'll be looking to build on revenue growth going forward. So avoid given a specific target Tony?\nTony Satterthwaite: Yes, I would just add Jamie, you know, revenue has been a little weaker in this downturn and DBU than previous downturns. And so we've been really pleased with the cost performance and the restructuring and focusing going forward is going to be on how do we see better revenue growth as that business comes back? And how do we gain some share in the parts and service business in particular? So that's what we're looking for more about how do we get that business back to a higher revenue level than necessarily trying to get margins up.\nJamie Cook: Okay. But is there any reason to believe the margins can structurally sort of be now in the double-digit range on an adjusted EBITDA basis?\nTony Satterthwaite: That has been our goal. That's what we said when we launched this transformation program. So that's what we're trying to do is keep them in the double-digit level going forward. That's our goal. Yes.\nJamie Cook: Okay. Mark, and then on your cash \u2013 sorry, go ahead.\nTom Linebarger: Yes, it's Tom. I mean just to make sure I get them \u2013 you get the math right. So our view that we are already in double digits, while facing -- yes, we had some cost -- temporary cost measures that helped, but we had way more headwinds with regard to both sales and then parts and service decline. So our view is that, that we are on our plan despite pretty heavy headwinds. So we are not only feeling good about where we are, but we're more confident than ever that we're going to be in double-digit margins from now forward. So again, you can imagine some scenarios with COVID that would make it so you might have a quarter or 2 that weren't. But broadly speaking, our view is the restructuring stuff has gone better than we expected. So we \u2013 as Tony said, that was our target, and we feel like we're ahead of target. So that's just -- on the cash side, I'll let Mark fill in some more. But I mean, broadly speaking, we've definitely acted conservatively from a balance sheet this year to protect ourselves against the worst potential outcomes -- economic outcomes from the pandemic. So we've shored up the balance sheet with our debt offering, low cost financing, our cash flow has improved dramatically. So we feel good about the position the company is in and expect, barring some significant change in economic conditions, to return to our cash flow plans that we've been operating under for many years. So our plan is to go back to returning as a normalized level, half of our cash flow in dividends and share buybacks. We still have to take all that stuff to the Board. We have to finish our planning work for next year. There's a lot of work left to do. And of course, there's still a pandemic. So we'll keep watching and paying attention. But right now, as we see it, that's where we're headed. Mark, I don't know what you would add.\nMark Smith: Yes. I think we've made it clear, we're not trying to hold cash a little -- being cautious this year but I think Tom has made it clear going forward.\nJamie Cook: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research. Your line is now live.\nAdam Uhlman: Hey guys. Good morning. I was hoping to get your perspective on heavy truck markets. I guess we've seen this spike in spot rates and the orders have been soaring. I guess I'm just wondering how sustainable do you think that is? And most of your customers are looking for pretty aggressive build growth in the next year. I guess maybe you could frame up your thoughts on how the cycle plays out from here that would be helpful.\nTom Linebarger: Tony?\nTony Satterthwaite: Sure, Adam. We're all waiting. Sorry. We're not together, Adam. So this is Tony. Yes. It's been very pleasing to see the growth, particularly in the last couple of months. I think the thing to remember is that the virus is still with us. And although we are very encouraged, I also think we're very cautious about how the market is going to play out next year. I do think that there is a view that demand is higher, the newer trucks and newer products are definitely working better. We get really good feedback from customers. And we've got new products coming out next year that meet the latest greenhouse gas emissions for EPA 2021. So we're excited with the products we have on offer. Our OEM customers are feeling pretty bullish. But at the same time, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. And so we're just -- we're trying to be prudent. We're trying to keep our eye on all the things going on and make sure that we are ready if things come in stronger and we're prepared if things all of a sudden take a downturn. So the main characteristic of this COVID environment is unpredictability and volatility. And so we're just trying to be ready for that as best we can.\nMark Smith: I'll just say, Adam, the other thing we look at is really the parts consumption, because in prior cycles, this one may not be the same as prior cycles. In prior cycles, we've had a pretty good run of accelerating parts consumption before orders sustainably stepped up. So that's something, we're watching closely by segment and end market. And that should give you some indication from us and other participants in future quarters.\nAdam Uhlman: Okay. Got you. And then Mark, the \u2013 with these new products coming out for 2021, I guess, the company has been benefiting from lower warranty expense, and there's some structural actions going on there. Should we expect a pause in lower warranty expense next year, or do you think we have more legs lower as you execute on your strategic initiatives? Thanks.\nMark Smith: Thanks, Adam. Really good question. I think on the one end, of course, we're always driving for more improvement, but I would say that our expenses at 1.8% or 1.9% of sales for this year have run below expectations. And the principal drivers of the warranty performance are field performance of existing products, field campaigns, and then over a longer period of time, changing emission regulations and then the launch of new products. So \u2013 you're right, the launch of new products will continue. We typically start those with higher warranty rates. And this year, the number of field campaigns has been below normal. So we would expect even some tick up in the fourth quarter. And yes, probably, we shouldn't be looking in 1.8% for now as a run rate. So yeah, we'll provide you with an update on that when we get into next year, some tick up from here should be expect \u2013 we even expected something this quarter. But that's where we are right now.\nAdam Uhlman: Thanks. Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Joel Tiss from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nJoel Tiss: Hi. How is it going guys?\nTom Linebarger: Hi, Joe.\nJoel Tiss: I wonder, Tony, or \u2013 can you talk a little bit about any product lines that have been, like, systematically challenged? And I'm thinking over a couple of years, not just because of this. And any areas that you could like do product line simplification and reduce some of that exposure to drive the gross margins higher, or you're always doing that, and there's nothing that really stands out?\nTony Satterthwaite: Hey, Joe, I'll go first. I think we did some of that last year, right? So we ended production of one of our engine platforms in the pickup market in North America, which not only \u2013 we took a charge this time last year, but that's also improved our operating performance year-over-year, and similarly in one of the transmission lines of business. So yeah, we're always looking at things like that. But I would say, don't see any major changes like that. But there's always some opportunity to trim and prune and improve we would never.\nJoel Tiss: And I wonder if you can talk about the M&A environment out there and what you guys are focused on is \u2013 is everything so disrupted that it's not the right time to be looking, or maybe because things are disrupted, there are some unique opportunities? And what area would you be thinking about?\nTom Linebarger: I think \u2013 it's Tom. I can step in on that. I mean, for sure, in the second quarter, we were on pause a little bit, making sure that our balance sheet was shored up. But with all the potential outcomes, we took a pause. But things, as I mentioned to Jamie's question, I think things have begun to normalize, at least economically to a place where we feel pretty secure in our balance sheet. And we're looking at restarting our cash flow return, and we will -- of course, we have continued actively looking at the strategic areas where acquisitions would be interesting to us. You probably wrote a call from our previous calls or Investor Day that we kind of start with strategy first, acquisition second. So we think through what are the areas that we'd like to expand in. And we've talked about those before, but they're all the areas where we feel like our competitive advantages, the things that we bring in terms of technology, global footprint, supply chain, that sort of thing, help us move forward. And then, of course, our new technology areas, the acquisitions like we did with Hydrogenics and battery companies, those were to add new capabilities. So, we're continuing to look in those same areas. I think maybe the one comment I would make is that I expected, given the disruption for valuations to be lower today, so I was -- as you -- kind of like the basis of your question, I expect it, maybe disruption would cause valuations to drop out a little bit. That's actually not happened so much. It doesn't mean that it won't happen, but -- and it's maybe because of the private equity dollars are so large. But I would say as we look around using disciplined method to look at what acquisition would mean for our company. I still see acquisition prices relatively lofty. So, we'll continue to look, and we're continuing to talk to people and look for the right thing. But we will just -- we'll remain disciplined and look for the right things at the right price, and we find it, we'll act. And if we don't, we'll return more cash to shareholders just like we planned.\nJoel Tiss: All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning everyone.\nTom Linebarger: Hi.\nMark Smith: Hey Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Tom, now that a number of your customers have sharpened their pencils, at least publicly on their hydrogen and alternative vehicle strategies, are they any closer to allocating lower volume diesel engine product lines to you? Can you talk about, if you can, which regions or which product lines you see the most potential for you folks to add value for customers that have lower volumes in those areas?\nTom Linebarger: Jerry, here's the thing. I would say that every customer that we're talking to is doing exactly that pencil sharpening calculations that you talked about. It's a really different environment than it was 10 or 15 years ago, or the calculations were maybe the opposite about how to backward integrate more. Mostly what I hear is maybe backward integrate less. But that said, there's no deal until there's a deal, right? So, again, I can't really preannounce or suggest anyone who's going to go because they're -- they're difficult decisions for them to figure out what they want to continue and what they don't. I feel very optimistic that we'll play an increasing role with our major customers on selling them more diesel engines, providing them more components technology in the future than the past. So, I expect market share increase in the future based on the fact that they will decide that their money be spent elsewhere. Exactly where and when, again, I just -- I can't get ahead of my customers on those conversations, but we're talking with everybody about it. We're excited about it. And they have a lot of strategic considerations to make as do we. So, these conversations are complicated in -- and take time. But anyway, there you are. We're in it for sure, and we're -- and I'm confident that we will win increased share.\nJerry Revich: I appreciate the color. And Mark, as we look at the fourth quarter sales outlook, flattish sales. Normal seasonality is closer to up 7% sequentially. And you mentioned China, but obviously, North America and other regions are accelerating. So I'm just wondering, are you expecting a slowdown versus normal seasonality, or is it the sort of situation where, look, where \u2013 could get hit by the second wave, and we don't want to get into a situation where if it's worse, we're missing numbers. Is there some conservatism in there or other pieces that you're legitimately concerned with?\nMark Smith: Yes. The numbers will be what the numbers will be, Jerry. I mean we've been very focused on cost. And then Tony and the team are on this incredible ramp back up again. But let's just use the pickup truck market as an example. If you just said at Q3 in isolation, you would see that, that's in the top 10 quarters in history of pickup truck engine demand. But if you do look back at Q2, you would say it's 0, right? So you just can't normalize everything that happened in Q3 and say, flat means everything is flat. So I think there will be some rebalancing in some markets. But again, we'll see where it is. Our focus is on cost and delivery and then delivering the calendar results that go with whatever volume were thrown them.\nTom Linebarger: And Jerry as Tony said, we are encouraged by tough market. As these clients said to us, all of customers are projecting stronger volumes which is great for us. So yes we are always cautious, because that\u2019s how we live. But nonetheless we are encouraged by their comments and their vehicles to the market, they are watching fleet customer and what they're ordering, and we're hearing good things from the fleets, too. So yes, we are very encouraged. In China, while we expect seasonal demand, we don't expect a gigantic drop off. We just expect seasonal demand normal. It's just the thing is flying so high now that -- again, we just remain cautious. So just don't hear from us discouragement. We are \u2013 the markets are going well, and we're surprised and pleased by how strong they are, and we're encouraged by those. We're just trying to make sure that we balance our enthusiasm with the cautious attitude that's appropriate for a global pandemic.\nJerry Revich: Glad to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nDavid Raso: Hi, thank you. My question is on engine margins for next year, just thinking about the framework, Tom, and given your China comments just now. I'm trying to square up, it looks like next year, you have sort of a sweet spot of strong growth but not yet at those extremely high levels where sometimes there's inefficiency serving the domestic truck market. So on a consolidated margin basis, I'm just curious how you think about the margin structurally versus, say, 2019? Just some sense of what we might not get back to those revenues, are the domestic margins set up in a way where they could be maybe a little closer to '19 than otherwise, given some bit of a sweet spot. But then within the segment, you do have the JV income, which is a big contributor. And thus, maybe if you could share your initial views on '21 for China as that business is debatable, if it's up or not next year. So I just would appreciate your thoughts for an early framework on '21 engine margins?\nTom Linebarger: Well, within China, there are a number of moving parts, David that will add to the complexity. We're expecting a bigger step-up in the penetration of NS VI products. What that will happen to demand. The take up is all to be figured out there. So yeah, we're not in a position right now to give you 2021. I guess Q3 margins were higher than normal for a couple of the factors that we've laid out. But we're still going through our planning cycle for next year as we speak. So not as we speak, but after we speak here, we'll be back on that again here shortly. So it's just too early to say, given everything that's going on. Look, I would just say we are very pleased with performance of the engine business and the fact that they were able to deliver such strong margins in this very, very challenging environment. And I think it speaks to the strength of the global franchise and the scale we've got in multiple markets, obviously, North America and China has been primary. But yeah, we're not ready to give guidance next year. I appreciate you're asking. We'll look forward to giving an update with Q4 earnings.\nDavid Raso: Would you mind just to clarify there, just given how high China is today, maybe while you don't want to predict the industry, I'm curious -- and you've given some numbers in the past, But now we're a little bit closer, the incremental content, some of the opportunities are idiosyncratic to the company. If there is a thought that China's volumes are so high this year, they're down next year, but maybe you have some self-help offsets. Can you give us some framework, as we've discussed in the past, but now closer to it? What kind of potentially framework revenue impact you could see that is from better NS VI content or increase with photon and so forth? Can you help us a little bit, just frame it?\nMark Smith: Yeah. I'll just make a couple of comments, and then James can maybe give you some numbers. But I think this, kind of, couple of dynamics. One, so there's the potential -- or the expectation of higher content for the components business on a consolidated revenue basis. As the emissions regulations are rolled out, that's kind of a given, given that we saw -- we specify the after-treatment systems are an integral part of our engine system design. James will give you the numbers in a moment. We hope then, as we move in through these more advanced missions regulations, that we can continue to pick up share. We feel like our NS VI products have been well received. And our penetration of photon has already been really accelerating over the last couple of years. We're already up to 80%. And it's encouraging to see photons been picking up some share as well. So yes, we're optimistic about, if we set aside the market, which, of course, markets do drive earnings as well, but our position and our ability to add self-help there. And James, you can maybe quantify the revenues.\nJames Hopkins: Yeah. And David, from a revenue impact of that, we've talked broadly before, both between the emissions content in China and in India. That will be roughly $600 million of incremental revenue, and that primarily hits our component segment. I think in addition to that, Tom mentioned in his remarks excitement about the endurant transmission that we're selling 1,000 units out in the second half of this year. We'll see continued growth of that product in China next year, which will provide customers with even improved fuel economy and hopefully to more market share gains. And so I think that is also some self-help as we look into 2021.\nTom Linebarger: David, this is Tom. As you kind of think through the model, the numbers for this year are so high in the truck market. This is what Mark's saying that right now, it's just hard for us to do that. The weighing one or the other because we know what the content is. We know we've won the share with. We even have forecast for how we think it converts over to NS VI and what growth we see in transmissions. The challenge is just what's the overall market going to be. And we were wrong this year. I mean just to say it straight out, we had pretty balanced assumptions about how well this year would be, and we've been wrong every single quarter on the low side. It's been better than every single quarter. So that's why we're just a little gun shy about doing the overall balance for you. We will do it, of course, when we get done with fourth quarter earnings. But I just would say that, we're hopeful that we can offset a downturn with a lot of these other content pieces, but it just depends on how big the slope down is.\nDavid Raso: Yes. I mean that's what's interesting, Tom. I mean historically, your order book could be accelerating every time on the call, you want to say, well, China is going to slow down. And a lot of times, it doesn't. And in this environment, you'd almost say we're at such a high level. And you've seen Volvo and so forth already forecast China down next year. You know, betting man would have said like, well, knowing Tom's history or the way he looks at China, just trying to be cautious with it. And we'll definitely be hearing today baseline \u2013 oh, it's definitely down. It seems like what you're seeing enough internally in your own opportunities, it's still an open question, which estimates a little more positive than I would have thought.\nTom Linebarger: So yes, you're right about it. You're right, David. It is an open question, and I appreciate your comments, and I do acknowledge that I have been calling it down more than it has been. So I'll just take that one \u2013 and accept it. That hasn't been right. And so anyway, I think it's a good point you raise.\nDavid Raso: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Ann Duignan from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nAnn Duignan: Yes. Hi, I'd like to go back to Q4. I mean you've guided to revenue flattish quarter-over-quarter. You called out $90 million in higher compensation expenses. You mentioned perhaps warranty costs coming back up. Could you talk about some of the positives and negatives that we ought to consider beyond those or quantify maybe the warranty impact as we head into Q4? Just so we don't assume that EBITDA is flat, also minus the $90 million. What else should we take into consideration?\nMark Smith: Yes. I mean, there's really three main things. There's \u2013 you've got the $90 million \u2013 it's likely there's some increase in the warranty expense in the fourth quarter. And then, as I said in my prepared remarks, we trued up our variable compensation in the third quarter to catch up for our higher expectation. So I think it's unlikely now that we'll be showing up again in the fourth quarter. JV income, despite all the comments just passed, directionally, I would expect that still to be a little bit lighter in China, just based on seasonality. It's still very strong, just to be clear, year-over-year, but just weaker into the fourth quarter. So those are really the big moving parts. And other than the volume \u2013 and we've converted that well when we've received it this year.\nTom Linebarger: Yes. And we hope the volume being higher in the North America truck market is net positive towards incremental margins, too. It's a good market for us. And we're operating at a reasonably efficient level, especially given all the challenges as COVID. We're operating at a good level on North American truck market. So we're hopeful that, that also helps us some.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. And I think you mentioned also on distribution. If aftermarket were to continue to accelerate, that should be a positive for mix also. Is that a fair statement?\nMark Smith: It is a first statement, and it would benefit a number of businesses, but particularly distribution, yes.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll leave it there. As most of my other questions are answered. Appreciate it.\nTom Linebarger: Thanks, Ann.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question is coming from Ross Gilardi from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nRoss Gilardi: Good morning, guys.\nTom Linebarger: Hi, Ross.\nMark Smith: Hi. How are you?\nRoss Gilardi: Okay. Great. Thank you. Look, clearly, your overall results are very strong and very impressive. I realize that engines from mining and energy are not big parts of your company anymore, so sorry to focus there. I missed the strong quarter, but wanted to get your perspective on those two end markets. And I think you said, mining engine shipments were down 39%. Was that actually worse in the second quarter? You mentioned coal, and are you starting to view mining or energy as more structurally challenged end markets for Cummins, or is this just a cyclical downturn like prior downturns? And just beyond that, is there any real hope for a real pickup in either mining or energy in 2021, or do these businesses potentially get worse or just kind of flat line at a low level before they get better?\nMark Smith: James will do the numbers for you, Ross, just to confirm, first of all.\nJames Hopkins: Yes. Ross, so on the mining engine sales side, as you mentioned, third quarter revenues were very similar to second quarter in the mining overall. And as you mentioned, we continue to see relatively stable demand in miners that are going to be focused more on iron ore and copper and continued weak demand along the coal side of things. But we were flat sequentially on the mining revenues.\nRoss Gilardi: And oil and gas was de minimis?\nJames Hopkins: Yes. Oil and gas, very de minimis. So sales in North America at this point on the oil and gas side for new engines, almost nothing. And we've also continued to see very weak demand in oil and gas markets in relation to rebuilds, really kind of highlighting the fact that there are rigs that are not currently being utilized in the market.\nTom Linebarger: And, Ross, maybe just stepping back, I would just say that from a mining point of view, I don't think we see it as a structurally challenged market. Well, it's challenged in the following sense. There tends to be over shots and under shots a lot in the market. You know that well, and you know a lot of mining companies overshot by a lot in the last cycle and really got knocked back hard. And so needless to say, they're all being careful, not overshooting now, which has meant that equipment buying has been more muted, even in good markets, than it was in the previous cycle. So our expectation of the cycle was that it wasn't going to be as good as the last one, I'm sure enough it hasn't been at all. And of course, just general economic demand being dampened, confidence in future demand being dampened by the pandemic has meant that mining is indeed slow. And I think it really won't get a lot stronger until there's confidence built in global economic growth, which means the end of the pandemic. I mean really, I just don't see a way that it changes. Energy is a whole another conversation and energy has a lot more structural challenge to it, but I'm not the right one to answer it. As you say, we have a participation there, not a huge one. And so, I think, it's better for someone else to comment on that. But it looks more structurally challenged to me than some of the other markets.\nRoss Gilardi: Yes. Thank you.\nJames Hopkins: Okay, great. I think with that, that -- sorry.\nOperator: I'll turn the floor back over to you for any further or closing comments.\nTom Linebarger: Great. Thank you for that. So, again, I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for taking the time to call in today. Appreciate that, as always, and for your continued interest in Cummins. And I'll be available for any follow-up questions here this afternoon.\nMark Smith: And let me add my thanks to James. I really appreciate your attention. I'm sorry that I did not invite my dog [ph] to this quarterly call. I'll try t include her on future calls, but it was nice to have a noise-free call. Thank you very much for your attention. Bye-bye.\nTom Linebarger: Thanks everyone. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Tony Satterthwaite",
            "content": "Yes, I would just add Jamie, you know, revenue has been a little weaker in this downturn and DBU than previous downturns. And so we've been really pleased with the cost performance and the restructuring and focusing going forward is going to be on how do we see better revenue growth as that business comes back? And how do we gain some share in the parts and service business in particular? So that's what we're looking for more about how do we get that business back to a higher revenue level than necessarily trying to get margins up. That has been our goal. That's what we said when we launched this transformation program. So that's what we're trying to do is keep them in the double-digit level going forward. That's our goal. Yes. Sure, Adam. We're all waiting. Sorry. We're not together, Adam. So this is Tony. Yes. It's been very pleasing to see the growth, particularly in the last couple of months. I think the thing to remember is that the virus is still with us. And although we are very encouraged, I also think we're very cautious about how the market is going to play out next year. I do think that there is a view that demand is higher, the newer trucks and newer products are definitely working better. We get really good feedback from customers. And we've got new products coming out next year that meet the latest greenhouse gas emissions for EPA 2021. So we're excited with the products we have on offer. Our OEM customers are feeling pretty bullish. But at the same time, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. And so we're just -- we're trying to be prudent. We're trying to keep our eye on all the things going on and make sure that we are ready if things come in stronger and we're prepared if things all of a sudden take a downturn. So the main characteristic of this COVID environment is unpredictability and volatility. And so we're just trying to be ready for that as best we can. Hey, Joe, I'll go first. I think we did some of that last year, right? So we ended production of one of our engine platforms in the pickup market in North America, which not only \u2013 we took a charge this time last year, but that's also improved our operating performance year-over-year, and similarly in one of the transmission lines of business. So yeah, we're always looking at things like that. But I would say, don't see any major changes like that. But there's always some opportunity to trim and prune and improve we would never."

            "name": "Mark Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I would like you to leave this call with two key takeaways from our financial performance in the third quarter. Number one, we delivered solid decremental margins in the third quarter, which put us on track for full year performance that will extend our record of raising profitability over successive downturns. This performance is a testament to our operational flexibility, ramping down effectively in the second quarter and then converting additional volume into stronger earnings and record operating cash flow in the third quarter. Number two is a result of the record operating cash flows and the addition of low-cost, long-term financing in the third quarter, the company sits today with strong liquidity, which will allow us to keep investing in our future in the face of any further volatility and return any excess capital to shareholders in the future. Now, let me share some of the key details of our third quarter. Third quarter revenues were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 11% from a year ago. Sales in North America fell 18%, and international revenues were flat. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues by 1%, primarily due to a weaker Brazilian real. Earnings before interest and taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $876 million or 17.1% of sales for the quarter, compared to $958 million or 16.6% of sales a year ago, representing a decremental EBITDA of 13%. EBITDA dollars decreased by $82 million over the third quarter last year, driven by the negative impact of lower sales, partially offset by the benefits of prior restructuring actions, temporary salary reductions, lower warranty and material costs and increased joint venture income in China. During the quarter, we recorded a recovery of previously expensed value-added taxes in Brazil, which boosted revenues and pre-tax earnings by $44 million and primarily benefited the engine business. The variable compensation expense in the third quarter was higher than a year ago as we increased our accrual, reflecting higher expectations for full year company profitability than we anticipated three months ago. For the full year 2020, variable compensation is projected to be lower than 2019. Gross margin of $1.3 billion, or 26.4% of sales, increased by 50 basis points from a year ago. Lower base compensation expense due to the benefits of restructuring actions, temporary salary cuts, material cost reductions and the VAT recovery in Brazil, more than offset the impact of lower sales and higher variable compensation expense. As a reminder, our gross margin last year was negatively impacted by $37 million in pre-tax charges, as we exited two unprofitable product lines. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $67 million or 11% due to the benefits of restructuring, temporary salary reductions and reduced discretionary expenses, partially offset by the increased overall compensation. Research expenses decreased by $18 million or 7% from a year ago, but increased by $35 million or 19% from the second quarter, as expected, as we ramped up work at our global technical centers and continued progress on engineering programs following some disruption to operations in the second quarter. Joint venture income increased by $30 million, but driven by continued strong demand for trucks in China, and joint venture income in China was a record for the third quarter, as we converted those higher volumes into strong earnings. Other income of $21 million decreased by $40 million compared to a year ago. Last year, we recognized a onetime $35 million cash gain related to the company's foreign exchange hedging program, which did not repeat this year. Net earnings for the quarter were $501 million or $3.36 per diluted share compared to $622 million or $3.97 a year ago. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.5%, and income tax expense included unfavorable discrete items of $31 million or $0.21 per diluted share.  After a tough second quarter, operating cash flow rebounded to a record inflow of $1.2 billion in the third quarter, driven by strong profitability and lower working capital levels. Our inventory decreased by $185 million in the quarter, even as sales increased 33% from second quarter levels. Capital expenditures was $116 million in the quarter, down from $153 million a year ago. We expect full year capital expenditures to be in the range of $500 million to $525 million, unchanged from our prior guidance and down more than 25% from 2019. We continue to return cash to shareholders in the third quarter with $194 million of cash dividends paid out. In August, the company completed an aggregate $2 billion debt offering of 5, 10 and 30-year maturities, taking advantage of extremely attractive long-term interest rates that reflected both favorable market conditions and our own strong credit rating. This long-term financing was used in part to pay down our commercial paper borrowings and reduces our reliance on credit facilities going forward. Company's long-term credit ratings remain unchanged at A+ from Standard and Poor's and A2 from Moody's with stable outlooks  As a result of our strong operating cash flow and the debt offering, we boosted our total liquidity to $6.5 billion at the end of September, which puts Cummins in a strong position to navigate any further volatility that may lie ahead. In October, we announced an increase to our quarterly cash dividend, our 11th straight year of dividend growth. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated revenues to remain similar to third quarter levels. Strong industry orders are expected to lead to strong demand in North American truck markets and improved aftermarket demand. India has shown some signs of improvement from very low levels in demand as the lockdowns have been eased and some economic activities increasing. In China, where demand has been at record levels over the last 6 months, we expect to experience some seasonal declines in the fourth quarter, but demand remained at relatively strong levels. The temporary salary reduction that went into effect in mid-April ended at the end of September as planned. The restoration of salaries will add approximately $90 million of pretax expenses in the fourth quarter. In summary, we delivered a strong set of results in the third quarter, including record operating cash flow. I want to thank our employees around the globe for their dedication and commitment to excellence through these last 6 very challenging months. Following unprecedented decline in demand in the second quarter, we responded well in ramping back up in the third quarter, supporting our customers and maintaining financial discipline throughout. While many of our markets have improved, the effects of the pandemic can still be felt in many regions and may impact the pace of recovery. We will continue to align our business with market conditions, deliver strong operational performance, invest in the technologies that will fuel profitable growth and return any excess capital to shareholders. Finally, as Tom previously mentioned, we'll be holding our Hydrogen Day on November 16th, where we will highlight our participation in hydrogen economy. Additional details and registration can be found on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today and your interest in Cummins. Now let me turn it back to James. Hello? Yeah, obviously. You'll remember that we implemented a temporary salary reductions in the middle of April, Steve. So when you do the math, it's about $165 million of full year lower expenses in 2020. Obviously, that will not repeat. We've restored those salaries in the fourth quarter. The restructuring, I mean, is embedded in our solid decremental margins. And again, we don't have any further major restructuring actions in place, but we have captured the benefits of that $250 million to $300 million in the current year as anticipated. Yeah. I think, just at this point, so it's a very -- I understand the question. It's just too early even to assess our market conditions next year. But you will -- you can see from our results today that we're pushing on all the levers, productivity gains that we can. It's just too early beyond the obvious items to comment much on next year. Thank you. So the strength in international market, all being flat, lower down to China, right. There really wasn't any strength to speak of elsewhere in terms of year-over-year growth. There was steady recovery in some markets. But any part of our business that touch China, whether within the component business, even our construction business, within the engine business, data center orders for the power systems, anything that touch China was pretty much up year-over-year. And so that's really what \u2013 you're all flat international revenues for the quarter. It's typical currently that we see some seasonal weakening going into the third \u2013 into the fourth quarter every year in China. So we still expect relative to prior year, strong demand but weaker sequentially, primarily impacting the components business since all \u2013 pretty much all of their revenue was consolidated, and then to a lesser extent, the Engine business. So that's the primary market where we're expecting some seasonal declines. And then yes, truck production build rates, I think, are largely set for the fourth quarter. And then yes, on parts, what we saw in the second quarter was particularly some weaker demand in the bus market, truck parts, particularly on newer model, heavy-duty truck was stable in the third quarter, and we expect steadily improving parts demand in subsequent quarters. The big factor is really China easing, and we're not expecting rapid further acceleration in truck demand right now. Good. Yes, so you're right. And I'll start on Distribution, Tony, if you want to chime in. We have had a very focused effort, particularly in North America, on driving margin improvement, a lot of it's coming out of the cost side of the business, this years we've been pleased with the progress this year Jamie. I think then, you know, then we're really looking to see, you know, as parts and service which, you know, have been down, probably more, more than in prior cycles due to the severity of the impact of COVID. How that recovers in future years. So I think, we've made a lot of progress in the margin improvement over the last couple of years. We certainly expect to hang on to that. And then we'll be looking to build on revenue growth going forward. So avoid given a specific target Tony? Yes. I think we've made it clear, we're not trying to hold cash a little -- being cautious this year but I think Tom has made it clear going forward. I'll just say, Adam, the other thing we look at is really the parts consumption, because in prior cycles, this one may not be the same as prior cycles. In prior cycles, we've had a pretty good run of accelerating parts consumption before orders sustainably stepped up. So that's something, we're watching closely by segment and end market. And that should give you some indication from us and other participants in future quarters. Thanks, Adam. Really good question. I think on the one end, of course, we're always driving for more improvement, but I would say that our expenses at 1.8% or 1.9% of sales for this year have run below expectations. And the principal drivers of the warranty performance are field performance of existing products, field campaigns, and then over a longer period of time, changing emission regulations and then the launch of new products. So \u2013 you're right, the launch of new products will continue. We typically start those with higher warranty rates. And this year, the number of field campaigns has been below normal. So we would expect even some tick up in the fourth quarter. And yes, probably, we shouldn't be looking in 1.8% for now as a run rate. So yeah, we'll provide you with an update on that when we get into next year, some tick up from here should be expect \u2013 we even expected something this quarter. But that's where we are right now. Hey Jerry. Yes. The numbers will be what the numbers will be, Jerry. I mean we've been very focused on cost. And then Tony and the team are on this incredible ramp back up again. But let's just use the pickup truck market as an example. If you just said at Q3 in isolation, you would see that, that's in the top 10 quarters in history of pickup truck engine demand. But if you do look back at Q2, you would say it's 0, right? So you just can't normalize everything that happened in Q3 and say, flat means everything is flat. So I think there will be some rebalancing in some markets. But again, we'll see where it is. Our focus is on cost and delivery and then delivering the calendar results that go with whatever volume were thrown them. Yeah. I'll just make a couple of comments, and then James can maybe give you some numbers. But I think this, kind of, couple of dynamics. One, so there's the potential -- or the expectation of higher content for the components business on a consolidated revenue basis. As the emissions regulations are rolled out, that's kind of a given, given that we saw -- we specify the after-treatment systems are an integral part of our engine system design. James will give you the numbers in a moment. We hope then, as we move in through these more advanced missions regulations, that we can continue to pick up share. We feel like our NS VI products have been well received. And our penetration of photon has already been really accelerating over the last couple of years. We're already up to 80%. And it's encouraging to see photons been picking up some share as well. So yes, we're optimistic about, if we set aside the market, which, of course, markets do drive earnings as well, but our position and our ability to add self-help there. And James, you can maybe quantify the revenues. Yes. I mean, there's really three main things. There's \u2013 you've got the $90 million \u2013 it's likely there's some increase in the warranty expense in the fourth quarter. And then, as I said in my prepared remarks, we trued up our variable compensation in the third quarter to catch up for our higher expectation. So I think it's unlikely now that we'll be showing up again in the fourth quarter. JV income, despite all the comments just passed, directionally, I would expect that still to be a little bit lighter in China, just based on seasonality. It's still very strong, just to be clear, year-over-year, but just weaker into the fourth quarter. So those are really the big moving parts. And other than the volume \u2013 and we've converted that well when we've received it this year. It is a first statement, and it would benefit a number of businesses, but particularly distribution, yes. Hi. How are you? James will do the numbers for you, Ross, just to confirm, first of all. And let me add my thanks to James. I really appreciate your attention. I'm sorry that I did not invite my dog [ph] to this quarterly call. I'll try t include her on future calls, but it was nice to have a noise-free call. Thank you very much for your attention. Bye-bye."

            "content": "Thank you, James, and good morning. Third quarter continued a period of high demand volatility across our end markets. Three months ago, we experienced the largest sales decline in the company's history. We have now followed that with the largest sequential increase in sales in the company's history. Even with the dramatic increase, however, sales remained below last year's levels. While we have seen increased demand around most of our end markets over the last three months, we continue to see differences in recovery rates, both by market and by region, and we expect these differences to continue. Our employees have done a remarkable job of supporting our customers through this period while maintaining a safe work environment. In the third quarter, our supply chain organization continue to support near record levels of truck production in China, as well as ramping up production to meet significantly increased demand in the North American heavy duty truck, and pickup market. Our engineering group has continued to successfully launch new products during this period, over the last six months we introduced an entire range of broad stage six products in India, and portions of our National Standard VI portfolio in China. We also recently announced our full product lineup to meet EPA 2021 regulations in North America. While nearly everything about the way we have worked -- we work has changed due to COVID-19, the commitment and capability of our employees has remained intact. Now I'll move to a summary of our third quarter results and a discussion of our major end markets. Mark will then take you through more details of our third quarter financial performance and update you on our balance sheet and liquidity. Revenues for the third quarter of 2020 were $5.1 billion, a decrease of 11%, compared to the third quarter of 2019. EBITDA was $876 million or 17.1%, compared to $958 million or 16.6% a year ago. The impact of lower volumes and higher variable compensation costs was offset by the benefits of restructuring, temporary salary reductions, reduced warranty costs and higher joint venture income. The increase in joint venture income was primarily due to continued strong levels of demand in China. Engine Business revenues declined by 13% in the third quarter compared to a year ago. Lower production in North American truck markets drove most of the revenue decline. EBITDA margin for the quarter was 18.1%, compared to 14.1% for the same period in 2019. Cost savings related to restructuring activities and salary reductions, as well as increased joint venture income, partially offset the impact of lower volumes. Third quarter results also benefited from a VAT recovery in Brazil. Sales for our Distribution segment declined by 14% year-over-year, with lower revenues in domestic and international markets. Third quarter EBITDA was $182 million or 10.6% of sales, compared to 9.3% in the third quarter of 2019. EBITDA margins increased, as we realize more of the benefits of our transformation work in North America. Third quarter revenues for the Components segment declined 7%. Sales in North America declined 24%, driven by lower truck build rates, while revenues in international markets increased by 26%, driven by higher truck demand in China. EBITDA for the third quarter was $261 million or 16.9% compared to 17.3% in the same quarter a year ago. EBITDA percent decreased, as the impact of lower volumes was partially offset by the benefits of restructuring and temporary salary reductions. Power Systems sales in the third quarter declined 13% year-over-year. Industrial sales declined 21%, driven by continued weakness in oil and gas and mining markets. Power Generation sales decreased by 7%, with lower revenues in both North America and international markets. EBITDA in the third quarter was 10.3% or $101 million, compared to 14% a year ago. The impact of lower volumes more than offset the benefits of cost reduction actions. In the New Power business, sales of $18 million were double those from a year ago. EBITDA was a loss of $40 million, in line with our expectations. Now I will comment on some of our key regions and markets, starting with North America, and then I'll cover some of our largest international markets. Our third quarter revenues in North America declined 18% to $3 billion, but increased by 49% sequentially. Compared to last year, we experienced lower demand in both on and off highway markets, as well as within our parts and service business. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks declined 35% in the third quarter, compared to a year ago, but rose 119% sequentially. Year-to-date, our market share is 33%, driven by the continued strong performance of our products in the field. Production of medium-duty trucks decreased by 33% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, but increased 76% from second quarter levels. We continue to maintain our clear market share leadership in the medium-duty truck market, with over 80% of new trucks powered by Cummins power trains in 2020. Total shipments to our North American pickup truck customers increased 4% compared to a year ago, and included a catch-up in production by our OEM partner after an extended second quarter shut down. Demand in domestic bus markets remain weak in the third quarter with sales down, 24%, driven by demand lower demand from both transit and school bus customers. In domestic, our highway market engine sales for construction equipment decreased by 47%, driven by lower demand by rental fleets who went through a significant replenishment cycle in 2018 and 2019. Revenues for power generation equipment fell by 7% with lower demand and backup power market. Demand for engines and oil and gas markets declined by 80%. Now I'll turn to our international markets. International revenues were flat in the third quarter of 2020, compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures were $1.7 billion, an increase of 46%, compared to a year ago, driven by continued strong demand in both truck and construction markets. And the third quarter industry demand for medium and heavy duty trucks in China, increased by 74% compared to a year ago. While demand declines sequentially, which is normal in the third quarter for China. Total industry production with the highest on record for any third quarter. Demand continues to be driven by improved levels of freight activity and government policies, supporting the scrapping of old NSV trucks. Our market share was 17% in the quarter, up from 16% in the third quarter of 2019, driven by increased truck market share of our partner Foton, along with higher utilization of our engine in Foton trucks, which now stands at over 80%. Industry sales of light duty trucks, increased by 49% in the third quarter, and our market share was 9%, up from 7% last year, our increased market share was driven by improved truck market share Foton, as well as increased use of our engines and JC, while new NSX regulations come into effect for all markets in China next July, there are certain cities and applications where these regulations are already in place. 12 of our NSX engine models are now in production, including our entire light duty portfolio, as well as our leading 6.7 and 12 liter products. We've shipped over 50,000 NSX compliant units so far in 2020 and are seeing strong acceptance of our new engines. In addition, we are now selling our automated manual transmissions into the Chinese market, and are on track to sell over 1000 Endurant AMTs by the end of the year. Third quarter demand for excavators in China, increased by 57% from a year ago. The central government is encouraging increased levels of borrowing by local municipalities to support investment in infrastructure and housing projects. So far this year over $500 billion in local government loans have been issued, targeting infrastructure projects and resulting in increased excavator demand. Our market share was 16% this quarter compared to 15% a year ago, driven by the strong performance of our domestic OEM customers. Demand for power generation equipment in China was flat compared to a year ago with increased demands on data center customers offset by weaker demand for standby power. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $295 million, a reduction of 14% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck sales in India decreased 47%. While power generation sales declined by 45%. While demand in India remains at very low levels. It's the industry truck sales more than triple compared to second quarter levels. While credit availability remains tight, certain segments of the truck market, especially those tied to construction are seeing a recovery in demand driven by state government stimulus for infrastructure. Cummins is well positioned to benefit from our recovery in Indian markets. Both because of our leading market position, as well as the incremental content we have on engines that meet BSVI on-highway emission standards, which became effective in April. Outside of India and China, we saw a year-over-year revenue declines of 8% in Europe, and 15% in Latin America, primarily due to lower truck production, compared to the second quarter sales \u2013 compared to the second quarter sales increased by 25% in Europe, and increased by 102% in Latin America, as OEMs resumed truck production in both regions. Global sales of mining engines declined 39% compared to a year ago. Demand remains stable among copper and iron ore miners, while sales related to coal mining remained low. I also wanted to discuss our aftermarket revenues during this quarter. Sales of parts declined by 12% in our engine business and 14% in our Power Systems business. Part sales remain depressed in our Power Systems business, due to low demand in oil and gas markets, as well as lower rebuild activity in mining markets. In our engine business, parts sales were down 12% year-over-year for increased 20% sequentially. Compared to last year, we are seeing weaker demand in bus markets and parts for older model trucks. Parts demand for current on-highway truck engines are flat with last year. While demand increased from second quarter levels across most of our end markets, we remain cautious about future demand increases due to the continued spread of COVID-19 in most countries outside of Asia. And while we are encouraged by continued strong demand in China and improving fundamentals in North American truck markets, industry backlogs remain at modest levels. We currently expect consolidated company revenues in the fourth quarter to be similar to third quarter levels, with higher demand in North American truck markets and continued improvement in aftermarket sales, partially offset by lower demand in China. We continue to expect that the pace of market recovery will differ from region-to-region and may change based on government actions, both to control the spread of COVID-19 or to stimulate their economies and build business and consumer confidence. We continue working hard to support our end users and build our \u2013 build strong OEM relationships during this period. In August, we announced the extension of our medium and heavy-duty truck engine partnership with Navistar. Cummins will continue to supply engines for Navistar's medium and heavy-duty trucks as well as for bus applications through the end of 2026, extending our 80-year relationship with Navistar. Through the development and introduction of new products, we continue to reduce the emissions levels of our products while increasing fuel economy. This includes the launch of our full product lineup for 2021 EPA regulations in North America and NSVI regulations in China and BSVI regulations in India. We are encouraged by the performance and market acceptance of these products that are already in the field. We also continue to focus on supporting our customers in their transition to carbon-neutral technologies. Our revenues doubled in our new Power Segment this quarter, and we are excited to share more about how we expect our hydrogen production and fuel cell business to develop at Cummins Hydrogen Day on November 16. We hope you all will be able to attend this virtual event. Now let me turn it over to Mark to discuss our financial performance this quarter, including our record operating cash flow. Mark? Yes, it's Tom. I mean just to make sure I get them \u2013 you get the math right. So our view that we are already in double digits, while facing -- yes, we had some cost -- temporary cost measures that helped, but we had way more headwinds with regard to both sales and then parts and service decline. So our view is that, that we are on our plan despite pretty heavy headwinds. So we are not only feeling good about where we are, but we're more confident than ever that we're going to be in double-digit margins from now forward. So again, you can imagine some scenarios with COVID that would make it so you might have a quarter or 2 that weren't. But broadly speaking, our view is the restructuring stuff has gone better than we expected. So we \u2013 as Tony said, that was our target, and we feel like we're ahead of target. So that's just -- on the cash side, I'll let Mark fill in some more. But I mean, broadly speaking, we've definitely acted conservatively from a balance sheet this year to protect ourselves against the worst potential outcomes -- economic outcomes from the pandemic. So we've shored up the balance sheet with our debt offering, low cost financing, our cash flow has improved dramatically. So we feel good about the position the company is in and expect, barring some significant change in economic conditions, to return to our cash flow plans that we've been operating under for many years. So our plan is to go back to returning as a normalized level, half of our cash flow in dividends and share buybacks. We still have to take all that stuff to the Board. We have to finish our planning work for next year. There's a lot of work left to do. And of course, there's still a pandemic. So we'll keep watching and paying attention. But right now, as we see it, that's where we're headed. Mark, I don't know what you would add. Tony? Hi, Joe. I think \u2013 it's Tom. I can step in on that. I mean, for sure, in the second quarter, we were on pause a little bit, making sure that our balance sheet was shored up. But with all the potential outcomes, we took a pause. But things, as I mentioned to Jamie's question, I think things have begun to normalize, at least economically to a place where we feel pretty secure in our balance sheet. And we're looking at restarting our cash flow return, and we will -- of course, we have continued actively looking at the strategic areas where acquisitions would be interesting to us. You probably wrote a call from our previous calls or Investor Day that we kind of start with strategy first, acquisition second. So we think through what are the areas that we'd like to expand in. And we've talked about those before, but they're all the areas where we feel like our competitive advantages, the things that we bring in terms of technology, global footprint, supply chain, that sort of thing, help us move forward. And then, of course, our new technology areas, the acquisitions like we did with Hydrogenics and battery companies, those were to add new capabilities. So, we're continuing to look in those same areas. I think maybe the one comment I would make is that I expected, given the disruption for valuations to be lower today, so I was -- as you -- kind of like the basis of your question, I expect it, maybe disruption would cause valuations to drop out a little bit. That's actually not happened so much. It doesn't mean that it won't happen, but -- and it's maybe because of the private equity dollars are so large. But I would say as we look around using disciplined method to look at what acquisition would mean for our company. I still see acquisition prices relatively lofty. So, we'll continue to look, and we're continuing to talk to people and look for the right thing. But we will just -- we'll remain disciplined and look for the right things at the right price, and we find it, we'll act. And if we don't, we'll return more cash to shareholders just like we planned. Hi. Jerry, here's the thing. I would say that every customer that we're talking to is doing exactly that pencil sharpening calculations that you talked about. It's a really different environment than it was 10 or 15 years ago, or the calculations were maybe the opposite about how to backward integrate more. Mostly what I hear is maybe backward integrate less. But that said, there's no deal until there's a deal, right? So, again, I can't really preannounce or suggest anyone who's going to go because they're -- they're difficult decisions for them to figure out what they want to continue and what they don't. I feel very optimistic that we'll play an increasing role with our major customers on selling them more diesel engines, providing them more components technology in the future than the past. So, I expect market share increase in the future based on the fact that they will decide that their money be spent elsewhere. Exactly where and when, again, I just -- I can't get ahead of my customers on those conversations, but we're talking with everybody about it. We're excited about it. And they have a lot of strategic considerations to make as do we. So, these conversations are complicated in -- and take time. But anyway, there you are. We're in it for sure, and we're -- and I'm confident that we will win increased share. And Jerry as Tony said, we are encouraged by tough market. As these clients said to us, all of customers are projecting stronger volumes which is great for us. So yes we are always cautious, because that's how we live. But nonetheless we are encouraged by their comments and their vehicles to the market, they are watching fleet customer and what they're ordering, and we're hearing good things from the fleets, too. So yes, we are very encouraged. In China, while we expect seasonal demand, we don't expect a gigantic drop off. We just expect seasonal demand normal. It's just the thing is flying so high now that -- again, we just remain cautious. So just don't hear from us discouragement. We are \u2013 the markets are going well, and we're surprised and pleased by how strong they are, and we're encouraged by those. We're just trying to make sure that we balance our enthusiasm with the cautious attitude that's appropriate for a global pandemic. Well, within China, there are a number of moving parts, David that will add to the complexity. We're expecting a bigger step-up in the penetration of NS VI products. What that will happen to demand. The take up is all to be figured out there. So yeah, we're not in a position right now to give you 2021. I guess Q3 margins were higher than normal for a couple of the factors that we've laid out. But we're still going through our planning cycle for next year as we speak. So not as we speak, but after we speak here, we'll be back on that again here shortly. So it's just too early to say, given everything that's going on. Look, I would just say we are very pleased with performance of the engine business and the fact that they were able to deliver such strong margins in this very, very challenging environment. And I think it speaks to the strength of the global franchise and the scale we've got in multiple markets, obviously, North America and China has been primary. But yeah, we're not ready to give guidance next year. I appreciate you're asking. We'll look forward to giving an update with Q4 earnings. David, this is Tom. As you kind of think through the model, the numbers for this year are so high in the truck market. This is what Mark's saying that right now, it's just hard for us to do that. The weighing one or the other because we know what the content is. We know we've won the share with. We even have forecast for how we think it converts over to NS VI and what growth we see in transmissions. The challenge is just what's the overall market going to be. And we were wrong this year. I mean just to say it straight out, we had pretty balanced assumptions about how well this year would be, and we've been wrong every single quarter on the low side. It's been better than every single quarter. So that's why we're just a little gun shy about doing the overall balance for you. We will do it, of course, when we get done with fourth quarter earnings. But I just would say that, we're hopeful that we can offset a downturn with a lot of these other content pieces, but it just depends on how big the slope down is. So yes, you're right about it. You're right, David. It is an open question, and I appreciate your comments, and I do acknowledge that I have been calling it down more than it has been. So I'll just take that one \u2013 and accept it. That hasn't been right. And so anyway, I think it's a good point you raise. Yes. And we hope the volume being higher in the North America truck market is net positive towards incremental margins, too. It's a good market for us. And we're operating at a reasonably efficient level, especially given all the challenges as COVID. We're operating at a good level on North American truck market. So we're hopeful that, that also helps us some. Thanks, Ann. Hi, Ross. And, Ross, maybe just stepping back, I would just say that from a mining point of view, I don't think we see it as a structurally challenged market. Well, it's challenged in the following sense. There tends to be over shots and under shots a lot in the market. You know that well, and you know a lot of mining companies overshot by a lot in the last cycle and really got knocked back hard. And so needless to say, they're all being careful, not overshooting now, which has meant that equipment buying has been more muted, even in good markets, than it was in the previous cycle. So our expectation of the cycle was that it wasn't going to be as good as the last one, I'm sure enough it hasn't been at all. And of course, just general economic demand being dampened, confidence in future demand being dampened by the pandemic has meant that mining is indeed slow. And I think it really won't get a lot stronger until there's confidence built in global economic growth, which means the end of the pandemic. I mean really, I just don't see a way that it changes. Energy is a whole another conversation and energy has a lot more structural challenge to it, but I'm not the right one to answer it. As you say, we have a participation there, not a huge one. And so, I think, it's better for someone else to comment on that. But it looks more structurally challenged to me than some of the other markets. Great. Thank you for that. So, again, I just wanted to say thanks to everyone for taking the time to call in today. Appreciate that, as always, and for your continued interest in Cummins. And I'll be available for any follow-up questions here this afternoon. Thanks everyone. Bye."

Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Craig: Thanks Todd and good morning. I'd like to begin by expressing my thanks to all our Meritor employees for their dedication and hard work as we take on the challenges we faced today. As part of an essential business, Meritor employees remain committed to supporting the delivery of medical, food and other critical products for our communities around the world. I also want to express my thanks to the frontline workers that Meritor had the privilege to support in the fight against Covid-19. I'll now spend just a couple minutes talking about the second quarter before providing an update on the status of the business today in light of Covid-19. Let's turn to Slide 3. The company was performing extremely well before the pandemic began to impact production first in China beginning in mid-January then throughout the rest of the world beginning late in the second quarter and continuing into the third. Carl will share more detail, but here you can see the highlights from the quarter. Sales were down $285 million from last year due to lower volumes. We finished the quarter however with a 12.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 12% in the same quarter of last year. That income was $240 million, up $167 million from the same period last year. This was driven by $203 million of after tax income associated with the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO. Our liquidity position at the end of the second quarter was $829 million. This represents approximately 20% of our trailing 12-month sales. Cash on the balance sheet was $508 million. We have access to the remaining $321 million of availability under our revolving credit facility and expect to be in compliance with our covenants under this facility for the remainder of the year. Although, it is still early to accurately forecast the extent of the pandemic's impact on the industry, the strong foundation we built over the past several years will provide advantages as we work through this crisis. Let's go to Slide 4. As we bring operations up around the world, the safety of our employees is our highest priority. Over time, we have improved our safety record to be comparable with the best companies in the world and it is my intent to maintain that level of excellence as we face the challenge of protecting our employees during this global health crisis. We have developed a comprehensive set of procedures that make up safe start. This plan outlines protocols for operating in this new reality. It includes procedures and policies that will be audited at each of our global locations whether it's a manufacturing plant, office, distribution center or a test environment. These practices include preventative measures in entryways and common locations, heat mapping to identify areas that require special attention, personal protective equipment, wellness checks, more frequent and in-depth cleanings, visual indicators and the attrition [Indiscernible] 0:05:52.5of social distance coaches, to ensure that we are following and sharing best practices across the company. I have asked Meritor's General Auditor to assume the additional role of Chief Safety Compliance Officer. He will consult with outside experts as needed to ensure that best practices are being implemented and followed. On Slide 5, we provide a current update on our global operations. Meritor's aftermarket distribution business ran without interruption over the past two months to maintain the supply of critical replacement parts for trucks and trailers. Our industrial business operated at lower volumes to support the production of vehicles considered critical for defense, bus and coach, terminal tractor, fire and rescue and other off highway applications. We also maintained delivery of battery electric kits from our TransPower facility in California primarily for Kalmar terminal tractors for delivery to companies like Amazon and Walmart. And we continue to work on critical electric vehicle integration projects for our customers. Currently, the majority of our operations in North America and Europe have resumed limited production. Over the coming weeks, we also expect to restart operations in South America and India. China resumed full operations last month. We acted swiftly to implement a series of actions that took effect in early April. This allowed us time to look at the business longer term and evaluate next steps. These actions included a reduction in pay for salaried employees in addition to reduce discretionary spending and capital expenditures. Since that time, we have lessened the salary reduction for most employees beginning May 1 the current reduction in payer 40% to 50% of base salaries will be reduced to 20% to 25%. Salary reductions for the executive committee including me will remain up to previously set levels of 50% to 60%. Other actions announced in March are in fact indefinitely. Now, I'll turn the call over to Carl.\nCarl Anderson: Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call I'll review our second quarter financial results, liquidity position, debt maturity profile and retirement related liabilities. Before I begin, I wanted to take an opportunity to express how proud I'm of our team's ability to quickly mobilize and rise to the challenges, which have been placed before us. Now, let's walk through our second quarter financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 6. Overall, sales were $871 million, down 25% from the same period last year. Sales in our commercial truck segment decreased by 33% year-over-year to $588 million. The decrease in revenue was in line with global truck market conditions as all regions saw lower production levels. The suspension of production due to COVID-19 first in China in mid-January and then late March in Europe also contributed to lower sales. In our Aftermarket, Industrial and Trailer segment sales was $319 million, down $10 million or 3% from last year. Lower sales were primarily driven by decreased volumes across the segment including the beginning impacts of COVID-19 and overall market demand, partially offset by $43 million in revenue generated from our AxleTech business. Net income from continuing operations attributable to the company was $240 million compared to $73 million in the same period last year. As Jay mentioned higher net income year-over-year was driven by $203 million of after tax income associated with the termination of the aftermarket distribution arrangement with WABCO. Adjusted EBITDA was $107 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $139 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.3% compared to 12% a year ago. The improvement in margin was largely driven by a $10 million adjustment of lower incentive compensation expense to align with the revised performance expectations due to COVID-19. We also recognized the $4 million benefit resulting from a tax law change in India. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $55 million, down $33 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck came in at 9.4%, down from 10% in the prior year. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin were driven primarily by lower volumes, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs, lower net steel cost, and other material costs. Segment adjusted EBITDA in our Aftermarket, Industrial and Trailer segment was $49 million, a decrease of $3 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 40 basis points to 15.4%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $292 million compared to $19 million in the same period last year. The increase in free cash flow was driven primarily by the $265 million of cash received from WABCO. Next, I'll review the debt governs of revolving credit facility on Slide 7. The credit facility as the sole financial covenant based on priority debt which is a subset of our total outstanding debt. The calculation states priority debt cannot exceed trailing 12-month compliance EBITDA by more than 2.25x. It is important to note, the $265 million pretax income we recorded associated with the WABCO termination is included in trailing 12-month compliance EBITDA. Now let me walk you through the calculation in detail. First, priority debt is comprised of any outstanding borrowings under the revolver inclusive of any term loan funding, any outstanding US factoring and US securitization balances plus any secured lien for us consists of our capital leases. In total, priority debt as of the second quarter was $633 million. Secondly, priority debt as compared to trailing 12 months compliance EBITDA which starts with consolidated net income and then added back our depreciation, amortization, interest in taxes. Including other minor adjustments, the total 12 months trailing compliance EBITDA at the end of the second quarter was $701 million. The results in ratio are 0.9x priority debt compared to compliance EBITDA significantly under the limit of 2.25x. Furthermore, the covenant is only measured on the last day of each quarter. If compliance is achieved, the covenant is being met for the entire following quarter. As the income from the WABCO termination will be included in our priority debt calculation for four fiscal quarter is going forward, at this time, we expect to be in compliance with our covenant throughout the year and maintain access to the full credit facility. Let's move to Slide 8, which details our extended debt maturity profile and retirement liabilities. As you can see on the chart on the left, we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. In fact, we only have $4 million of debt coming due for the remainder of this year and $32 million in total debt maturities in fiscal year 2021. You will note in fiscal year 2023, we saw the maturity for our US securitization facility. We typically extend this facility annually for an additional year, which we would expect to do again later this year. The bottom line is that we have a clear runway with our debt maturities with no significant cause on cash through 2024. At the end of 2019, our net pension liability was a $122 million, which translated to a 93% overall funded status. Based on this, we expect very manageable required contributions over the next couple of years. And while we have obviously seen challenging financial markets as we ended the second quarter, our estimated funding status has actually improved from the end of 2019. This has been driven by a combination of strong US asset returns in the plan, which are up over 10% through March and higher discount rates as corporate spreads have widened. While our plans will continue to be susceptible to changes in asset returns and discount rates as we move through the remainder of the year. Our asset allocation is skewed more towards fixed income given our liability hedging strategy. Overall, we are pleased with the performance to date. Turning to our OPEB liability, as we have previously discussed we have taken steps in recent years to significantly reduce this obligation. At the end of 2019, this liability was only $67 million. Overall with an extended debt maturity profile and well-funded pension plan, we don't have any significant cost and cash from these liabilities in the near-term. In summary, the balance sheet actions we have executed over the last several years along with our current liquidity position makes us well-positioned to navigate the current environment. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay.\nJay Craig: Thanks, Carl. Please turn to Slide 9 for our third quarter outlook. Let me highlight our assumptions, as I said it earlier segments of our operations have continued to run. We expect these businesses to contribute between 50% to 60% of our revenue during the third quarter. To restart and ramp up of our commercial truck business is not as clear, while we expect most of our plants around the world will be running in early May, there is uncertainty on timing and volume, which is driving a large range of our revenue outlook of $400 million to $500 million. Negative cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $225 million. This includes the one-time impact of the unwind of our factoring programs. These programs allow us to monetize our receivables quickly after they are generated. Removing the impact of factoring, we expect negative cash flow from operations of $25 million to $50 million during the third quarter. Turning to margins, we expect to hold sequential detrimentals in the third quarter in the range of 20% to 30%. This includes additional investment required to implement new safety protocols. We were able to achieve this due to the quick and aggressive cost containment measures we have already taken. I want to emphasize that we are running the business to focus on operational cash flow in the near term. Let's move to Slide 10. As we enter the second-half of the fiscal year and restart production, we are making sure that every safety protocol is in place, including providing the necessary PPE. With the existing challenges, it obtaining large quantities of masks, gloves, cleaning supplies and disinfectants. We will first make sure that each of our plants, distribution centers and testing labs has the necessary quantities on hand before we start allocating these supplies to global administrative offices. I have been pleased with the adjustments that our salaried employees have made to working remotely. With that in mind, our salaried employees will work from home until further notice. We have begun to see the favorable impact of our aggressive cost reduction initiatives. As I mentioned, we believe these initiatives will provide the stability necessary to minimize negative operating cash outflow in the near term. We are working closely with our customers to run production as needed to meet their schedules. Our assumptions include a significant decrease level of production for the remainder of 2020 and we will evaluate and implement additional cost actions with a focus on minimizing operating cash flow in the near term. As we now turn our attention to the longer term outlook for the company, we are evaluating the appropriate strategies for a global environment where demand for our products may be weak for many quarters. We plan to provide you with a longer term outlook for fiscal 2021 and our M2022 planned performance on our third quarter earnings call if there is a set of market forecasts that we are comfortable with for modeling purposes. This outlook will include a summation of the benefits we expect to see from the longer term actions we're in the planning phase of executing. While the pandemic created a situation unlike any we have faced in the past with the full repercussions as yet unknown, we are taking the actions we believe will put the company in the best position for the long term. I want to thank Meritor employees for their focus during this unprecedented crisis. Our employees' dedication and responsiveness to customers and to each other has been overwhelming. Now, we'll take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\nJosephSpak: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and good to hear all your voices. I hope everyone is okay. I guess first question is even if we sort of look at the decrementals in this quarter ex some of the incentive benefit, it still seems like there's a step down on the decrementals into the next quarter. Is that just all sort of you know volume driven as you know sort of feeling the bigger the clients or is there anything else that could sort of help bridge that gap between the performance?\nCarlAnderson: Yes. Good morning, Joe. Good to talk to you as well. Yes, as I think we look at the next quarter. One this, what we provided was a sequential look relative to the second quarter. I think when you cut through the math on a year-over-year basis it gets - it's kind of running a little bit in the low 20% range. And as far as we look specifically for the second quarter, as you pointed out we did benefit from lower incentive comps in our actuals, as well as the - in the one-time kind of tax impact that ran through EBITDA.\nJosephSpak: Okay and yes just, while I guess actually somewhat related. Obviously, sort of taking out a bunch of cost in the short-term and I guess some of that can be viewed as temporary. But as you mentioned sort of maybe new world, new era. Is there an opportunity to sort of maybe as you reevaluate make some of those temporary savings more permanent in the mid to long term as you reevaluate the cost structure?\nJayCraig: Joe, this is Jay. Thanks, very good question. Obviously, that was what I was referring to in my comments. We think the aggressive actions we took including 40% to 50% to 60% salary reductions in a very short order allowed us the time to sit back and say what is the longer term impact of this crisis look like to Meritor. And what additional actions should we take that can allow us to be successful throughout what potentially could be a longer term downturn. So we are looking at strategies as I mentioned in my comments and beginning to execute them that. We think we'll set our cost structure on the right basis for what we would expect to see for fiscal year 2021 and beyond.\nJosephSpak: Yes. Jay, the tough one, you know sort of, I guess, plan for otherwise hope, hope over the best mentality, but as a veterinary industry, I wanted to I guess pick your brand and what you thought could it be the potential snapback ability of the market and maybe what you're sort of hearing maybe from some of the, even your customers because even - if you look at sort of typical peak to trough timing probably would have normally come to the end of sort of cycle sometime around the end of the calendar year maybe a little later. And COVID obviously made it much steeper, but even if you sort of don't return to the replacement levels next year, it seems like there could be some pretty healthy growth versus obviously a very depressed 2020. So what are \u2013 do you have any high level thoughts on that?\nJayCraig: Well, I think it \u2013 it's, it's difficult for us to say in the near-term. And you heard the comments from our customers who have their calls, so far, they \u2013 they've been very reticent to project what the outlook looks like in future. And I think that goes for us as well. What I believe and what our team is working on is, is as you mentioned is setting up to plan for the worst and hope for the best and make sure we retain the capabilities in the company to respond to the aggressive snapback that ultimately will occur most likely in long quarters time as it always does and we're going to make certain we retain that expertise to be as successful as we have been and capturing the value on that snapback and those volumes.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question.\nAlexPotter: Yes. Thanks very much. Hope everybody is doing well. You mentioned that cutting back on CapEx on discretionary spending, can you just give maybe a few examples of things that you are and are not reducing spending on just trying to get a better idea of the sort of initiative that you think are sufficiently important to continue investing in even in this macro?\nChrisVillavarayan: Sure. Good morning, Alex. I think you know me, this is Chris Villavarayan. If you look at it, for example last quarter we talked about launching our or building a new facility in Brazil where we were looking at making a significant investment. As we see the current market, we might look at for example slowing down on that investment and just really modeling out where we see the market snapback and then making decisions like that. We are very definitely proceeding with the long-term prospects for Brazil, but in the short term, we might look at slowing down our investment. Also when you think about sustaining investments through our facility imagine for markets that we're running almost 60% to 70% from where we forecast, you could look and make decisions in the short-term on what we do. However, I think one thing that, Jay, is driving that as we think of the long term strategy in terms of investment in electrification, we are not slowing down on that process and as he also mentioned in how we are running the facilities and delivering the proportion or the systems we are continuing our investments into TransPower as well as electrification for the next quarter.\nAlexPotter: Okay. Very good. That's helpful. I was wondering if you could comment also on the supply chain risk, you know not all companies end up having this sort of balance sheet that you guys have. I'm thinking particularly of risks that you see upstream potentially for smaller suppliers. You know is this going to be an issue, you have solvency risk concerns for any of the suppliers that you rely on.\nJayCraig: Good question, Alex. And we're using the same playbook that we put in place during the 2008-2009 recession where we immediately put up a multi-discipline team together including finance, purchasing, supply chain, manufacturing expertise to do much more active monitoring of suppliers, particularly those who we think do not have the balance sheets that may provide them enough liquidity through this time period. So far, we have not seen any disruptions, but we're monitoring it extremely closely and that playbook that we did execute in 2008-2009 was very successful for us. Included in that is engagement of outside experts that we can send in to the suppliers to assist them with operational and financial challenges that we've already locked those same experts into agreements if they are necessary.\nAlexPotter: Interesting. Okay. That's good to hear. I \u2013 one thing, obviously this, this WABCO infusion was, was well timed. Can you update me us on the ongoing relationship with WABCO, if there is any I think \u2013 what is the relationship between the two companies going forward? Have you essentially severed all historical relationships now going forward or not?\nJayCraig: Yes. We have a much smaller relationship here through our aftermarket business as a distributor for certain products. But it, it, I, I don't want to misrepresent it, it's a fraction of what the business was previously. And those expected revenues are embedded in our outlook for the third quarter.\nAlexPotter: Okay. Very good. Last question. I know that you had historically looked at some of these smaller sorts of mom and pop machine, machine shop type operation to support aftermarket gearing and off highway. That always struck me as sort of an interesting business. I don't know I guess maybe two questions. First, do you want to continue building that part of the business through acquisition of these little companies? And question number two is, do you think COVID-19 will potentially present you with the opportunities to do that?\nJayCraig: That's a very good question, Alex. I think it gets around the broader question as obviously there will be M&A opportunities that present themselves through this crisis for people who maybe don't operate as well or have the financial wherewithal to withstand the downturn. At this point in time, we are focused to make certain that our company operates successfully as it's currently configured. And we like the growth prospects of the company in areas like electrification, like our recent off highway acquisition of AxleTech, so we didn't see a burning need to add bolt-on acquisitions at this time. Now as we come out of the crisis, if there is just some incredible opportunity on the landscape and we see our revenues growing during that time period we may revisit at that time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nJasonStuhldreher: Hi, Jay, and good morning. This is Jason Stuhldreher on for Brian. And just first question on margins maybe first in the Commercial Truck space. In the past we've talked about sort of layered capacity giving you the ability to sort of flex that debt, the footprint the direct labor footprint given with the variations in Commercial Truck. Just curious I mean in the margins that we saw this quarter, which I frankly thought were pretty good. Did any of those benefits from offloading that layer capacity or did that layer capacity pretty much already hit bottom by last quarter. And then similarly on Aftermarket, Industrial and Trailer. I was also impressed by the margins this quarter was thinking the AxleTech acquisition would be a little bit dilutive is that not the case sort of now?\nCarlAnderson: Good questions. This is Carl Anderson. Just on your first question as relates to Commercial Truck, as we look at those layered capacity cost for the most part those have pretty much been eliminated in the second quarter. We did have some that pretty much been eliminated in the second quarter. We did have some that carried a little bit in the first quarter. And as we go forward as we're kind of back in ramp up mode depending on the supply chains, you could see a little bit maybe some incremental cost kind of coming in over the next couple of quarters, but nowhere near where we were running last year with a high truck markets kind of at that point. And then as relates to your aftermarket question. I think the AxleTech business, I think; we're very pleased with the amount of synergies we've been able to achieve as it relates to that. One thing that's running a little bit softer than initial plan is just overall revenue for that business. And so I think the margins aren't exactly where we want them to be currently, but as you know over time as revenue begins hopefully at some point pick up, I think we're going to be in good position with an acquisition in that business.\nJayCraig: And just adding to Carl's comment, I think one of the benefits we got with also the layered capacity costs coming down is also a benefit from not seeing the premium freight costs associated with all of that. So we have seen some benefit both from the layered capacity as well as the premium freight. And I think in terms of the overall cost of purchase components versus our own internal cost there's also the benefit that we're seeing from that as well.\nJasonStuhldreher: All right. Got it. Okay, very helpful color. And then just I guess more broadly as we think about the electrification opportunity, Jay, I think you've mentioned, the team has mentioned how pivotal of a year 2020 we're shaping out to be in terms of the awards activity pipeline that was going to be coming here in the next few quarters. Just curious if that pipeline is still full or if that is \u2013 if the industry is basically push that out 8 to 12 months as we deal with the current situation?\nJayCraig: Yes. It's a very good question, Jason. Obviously, I think it's a question on the industry spend where this will be viewed as something that can be deferred to preserve capital. But so far all of the programs we're associated with particularly the largest program, the PACCAR program, it remains on schedule. I've had technical updates with the PACCAR team recently. Our products are performing extremely well and so we see no sign that our customers not too dissimilar from us are not continuing to prioritize that spend. And as Chris mentioned in one of his comments, this is one area with all the cost reductions we've made both on the CapEx and expense side. We are retaining our investments in electrification and we continually continue to respond to active code opportunities and still look at this year to be a very big year for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.\nRyanBrinkman: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Is there anything that you can relate about customer order books in the back half of the calendar year after lockdowns are presumably lifted? I'm sure their visibility is also low, but when you look across your various customers and your various end markets you know commercial and highway, off-highway, specialty trailer et cetera, are there notable differences and how you expect these end markets to bounce back or hold up.\nChrisVillavarayan: And maybe I'll take this one Ryan, just you know as you can see that we're not giving much guidance beyond the next quarter. Again, it's from the perspective that we are seeing from our customers as well. But at a very high level, let's just break it down into maybe the three areas. And if you think about aftermarket and we've looked through last quarter as well as you know what we're seeing at least in the short-term window, aftermarket is obviously holding well you know when you think about 75% of the products that we use to travel by truck. The aftermarket seems to be holding strong. We see a slight weakening but nothing that's dramatic in the near future. Moving to the specialty defense of highway space. As I think Carl pointed out, we have noticed, you know, we did notice at the back end of that order board was getting weaker, we could say maybe about 20%, 30% but nothing of significance obviously consistent demand on that side and we got to see how that plays out. The truck market is obviously the big one as we see the customers coming up in April or late April and early May, that's where we're going to probably see what the real order boards come in. So, we \u2013 all the customers will be up of you know as we see most will be up as up May 4. So that would be probably a good time to see a perspective. But then breaking it up by region maybe I'll just address in that way China, you know as, as you all of you know I think we've seen a quick V and markets are back now whether that will hold up is all based on stimulus. And then India and South America are still under a pretty hard shut down and so time will tell how those two markets will come up. But in those two markets, inventories were low as you know with the FX. And the other two markets have addressed previously, I think we just have to see where our customers come back at.\nRyanBrinkman: Okay. Thanks. You know those are helpful rundown. Just lastly from me, why are you it looks like unwinding some of your factoring facilities. Can you remind us, was that something that was previously planned you know prior to your mention in that March 25 release? And does it relate to the various Volvo facilities mentioned in the K or the US one with P&C that I think has a covenant attached. I'm just asking because it would seem maintaining the facilities might help bolster liquidity in the current environment or am I missing something? Thanks.\nCarlAnderson: Yes. Good morning, Ryan. It's Carl. Good question. You know I think that the factoring unwind is really \u2013 it's really that's a function of having a lot lower sales especially - really in Europe where we are utilizers of the supply chain financing program. So it's - if the unwind is just more, it's more natural because we're not able to sell receivables in normal course because the sales are a lot lower. The real impact is just because you have a timing mismatch as far as obviously the payables need to kind of run off in the working capital perspective. And you are unable to sell new receivables. So yes, it is consistent with what we kind of provided back in the March 25, March 25th 8-K that we put out as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc. You may proceed with your questions.\nJamesPicariello: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just regarding your covenant, the total priority debt over, over trailing EBITDA, I mean it seems very encouraging how the EBITDA is calculated; you just to clarify this include the gain on the WABCO aftermarket sale now. Is that right? And then, has there been any change on that point? And then just based on your third quarter outlook that outlook clearly be the most challenged environment, is it safe to assume that the Meritor can now avoid any covenant breach over the next 12-months? Thanks, Jay and Carl.\nCarlAnderson: Yes. Thanks, James. Yes. I mean I think what you're seeing from the WABCO income, yes, it is included in the trailing 12-month calculation. And so as I was highlighting that we're kind of carry through for the next really four quarters as well as we look to calculate the overall compliance to EBITDA. So as we look at what's in front of us not only third quarter but for the rest of this year, our expectation is we will not have any issues with our debt covenant and we feel that coupled with the overall liquidity of the company. So with the amount of cash on hand I think we're in a pretty good spot to be able to manage the current environment.\nJamesPicariello: Okay. Yes. That's great to hear. And then just on that factor receivable the previous question, can that reverse partially by as early as the fourth quarter?\nCarlAnderson: Yes. That's exactly right. And so that's how we're characterizing it. There is, we'll call it a one-time impact at a sales levels dropped significantly based on the lower production volume. But as the fourth quarter, if there is some pick up and production kind of comes back, you will see the cash benefits at that point in time.\nJamesPicariello: Got it. And then it sounds as though you guys were not stepping off the accelerator in terms of future EV investment for this year. But just in terms of CapEx is a good starting point and assumption of maybe a similar level of your CapEx as a percentage of sales for this year-\nCarlAnderson: I think that's early -\nJamesPicariello: Or early to be?\nCarlAnderson: That's a good way to think about. I think the last quarter that we had a guided about $115 million of CapEx. So it's probably closer in the $80 million, $85 million range at this point as we think for the remainder \u2013 for the full year. So that kind of around 3% is probably the right way to think about it.\nJamesPicariello: Got it. And then my apologies if I missed this, did you mention the AxleTech contribution in the quarter, so just wondering on that point and then how the synergies are trending, does the current environment accelerate or maybe delay the synergy pull through.\nCarlAnderson: No. I would say on the synergy side in AxleTech, we're coming in right on plan and actually we're looking and we feel very good with all the actions that we have been able to take since we acquired the company last year. You know there is a reference, obviously, we are seeing some softness in overall just revenue levels, specifically in the off-highway market, as well as in aftermarket. So overall the margin performance is still probably not where we want it to be, but a lot of that now is driven more on the revenue side as opposed to any of the cost actions that we've taken to date.\nJamesPicariello: And what about the just the revenue contribution in the quarter.\nCarlAnderson: Yes, it was about $43 million, so very consistent with what we saw in the first quarter as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. You may proceed with your question.\nFaheemSabeiha: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the guidance you are able to provide for FY 3Q and the additional color regarding the revenue breakdown but can you provide a little more color around Aftermarket, Industrial, and Trailer, I mean, then imply the sizable hit, and I know first talk about aftermarket coming down a little, just wondering if most of that's in Trailer or equally across all three parts of that business.\nCarlAnderson: Good morning, Faheem. You know I think one of the things that's in there is the impact from the WABCO, agreement being, our distribution agreement being terminated and so prior to the crisis that was a probably a book of business about a $115 million. So you are seeing a headwind now in this quarter that we're in as well and that will continue on as we kind of go forward. So a significant piece of that really relates to that particular business.\nFaheemSabeiha: Okay. And how much are you baking in from AxleTech acquisition in 3Q?\nCarlAnderson: Well, again I would say, we've not kind of given line by line guidance on the revenue, but I would just say the first two quarters that we've seen this year in AxleTech has been running a little bit north of $40 million of revenue. And I would expect - we don't expect probably some little bit further softness for a period of time for that business.\nFaheemSabeiha: Okay and then you commented a little on the visibility in the back half of the year, but as far as 3Q, I mean, you guys provided a pretty wide band and I'm just curious if that's based solely on orders received thus far as truck production restarts or if there could be some upside later in the quarter?\nJayCraig: I think it's really almost entirely based on the lack of visibility on the OE manufacturing side. So if you take the business that your questions, Carl, you were just discussing the aftermarket business and Industrial that represents roughly a 50% of our expected revenue in that guidance. So if you took the remaining revenue, we have almost a 50% range of aftermath on the truck OE business. And I think that's very consistent with what we're hearing from our customers both in our private discussions and what you've heard them discussed publicly as they've released their earnings. It's just - it's a very opaque visibility window right now and after this quarter. And so that's why we put as wide range on revenue as we did. But understand this revenue estimate was important for us internally as well because it gave us the markers on which we have to manage the business to achieve our objectives of having the operating cash outflow be a very limited amount.\nFaheemSabeiha: Yes. Okay. And as far as the 20% to 30% sequential downside earnings convergence, I mean, is that going to be balanced between commercial truck in aftermarket, industrial and trailer to one of those segments will look a little weaker?\nJayCraig: I don't think where we're providing that level of guidance just given the volatility, I mentioned on the revenue outlook. But what I would make note of is included in that downside sequential guidance is the incremental cost of providing the safety materials that we need to ramp up our production such as masks, face shields, sanitary products, positional cleaning. So there is some incremental cost that's being incurred right now that's outside our norms in running the business.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for any further remarks.\nTodd Chirillo: Thank you for joining our second quarter 2020 conference call. Please reach out to me directly with any questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jay Craig",
            "content": "Thanks Todd and good morning. I'd like to begin by expressing my thanks to all our Meritor employees for their dedication and hard work as we take on the challenges we faced today. As part of an essential business, Meritor employees remain committed to supporting the delivery of medical, food and other critical products for our communities around the world. I also want to express my thanks to the frontline workers that Meritor had the privilege to support in the fight against Covid-19. I'll now spend just a couple minutes talking about the second quarter before providing an update on the status of the business today in light of Covid-19. Let's turn to Slide 3. The company was performing extremely well before the pandemic began to impact production first in China beginning in mid-January then throughout the rest of the world beginning late in the second quarter and continuing into the third. Carl will share more detail, but here you can see the highlights from the quarter. Sales were down $285 million from last year due to lower volumes. We finished the quarter however with a 12.3% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 12% in the same quarter of last year. That income was $240 million, up $167 million from the same period last year. This was driven by $203 million of after tax income associated with the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO. Our liquidity position at the end of the second quarter was $829 million. This represents approximately 20% of our trailing 12-month sales. Cash on the balance sheet was $508 million. We have access to the remaining $321 million of availability under our revolving credit facility and expect to be in compliance with our covenants under this facility for the remainder of the year. Although, it is still early to accurately forecast the extent of the pandemic's impact on the industry, the strong foundation we built over the past several years will provide advantages as we work through this crisis. Let's go to Slide 4. As we bring operations up around the world, the safety of our employees is our highest priority. Over time, we have improved our safety record to be comparable with the best companies in the world and it is my intent to maintain that level of excellence as we face the challenge of protecting our employees during this global health crisis. We have developed a comprehensive set of procedures that make up safe start. This plan outlines protocols for operating in this new reality. It includes procedures and policies that will be audited at each of our global locations whether it's a manufacturing plant, office, distribution center or a test environment. These practices include preventative measures in entryways and common locations, heat mapping to identify areas that require special attention, personal protective equipment, wellness checks, more frequent and in-depth cleanings, visual indicators and the attrition [Indiscernible] 0:05:52.5of social distance coaches, to ensure that we are following and sharing best practices across the company. I have asked Meritor's General Auditor to assume the additional role of Chief Safety Compliance Officer. He will consult with outside experts as needed to ensure that best practices are being implemented and followed. On Slide 5, we provide a current update on our global operations. Meritor's aftermarket distribution business ran without interruption over the past two months to maintain the supply of critical replacement parts for trucks and trailers. Our industrial business operated at lower volumes to support the production of vehicles considered critical for defense, bus and coach, terminal tractor, fire and rescue and other off highway applications. We also maintained delivery of battery electric kits from our TransPower facility in California primarily for Kalmar terminal tractors for delivery to companies like Amazon and Walmart. And we continue to work on critical electric vehicle integration projects for our customers. Currently, the majority of our operations in North America and Europe have resumed limited production. Over the coming weeks, we also expect to restart operations in South America and India. China resumed full operations last month. We acted swiftly to implement a series of actions that took effect in early April. This allowed us time to look at the business longer term and evaluate next steps. These actions included a reduction in pay for salaried employees in addition to reduce discretionary spending and capital expenditures. Since that time, we have lessened the salary reduction for most employees beginning May 1 the current reduction in payer 40% to 50% of base salaries will be reduced to 20% to 25%. Salary reductions for the executive committee including me will remain up to previously set levels of 50% to 60%. Other actions announced in March are in fact indefinitely. Now, I'll turn the call over to Carl. Thanks, Carl. Please turn to Slide 9 for our third quarter outlook. Let me highlight our assumptions, as I said it earlier segments of our operations have continued to run. We expect these businesses to contribute between 50% to 60% of our revenue during the third quarter. To restart and ramp up of our commercial truck business is not as clear, while we expect most of our plants around the world will be running in early May, there is uncertainty on timing and volume, which is driving a large range of our revenue outlook of $400 million to $500 million. Negative cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $225 million. This includes the one-time impact of the unwind of our factoring programs. These programs allow us to monetize our receivables quickly after they are generated. Removing the impact of factoring, we expect negative cash flow from operations of $25 million to $50 million during the third quarter. Turning to margins, we expect to hold sequential detrimentals in the third quarter in the range of 20% to 30%. This includes additional investment required to implement new safety protocols. We were able to achieve this due to the quick and aggressive cost containment measures we have already taken. I want to emphasize that we are running the business to focus on operational cash flow in the near term. Let's move to Slide 10. As we enter the second-half of the fiscal year and restart production, we are making sure that every safety protocol is in place, including providing the necessary PPE. With the existing challenges, it obtaining large quantities of masks, gloves, cleaning supplies and disinfectants. We will first make sure that each of our plants, distribution centers and testing labs has the necessary quantities on hand before we start allocating these supplies to global administrative offices. I have been pleased with the adjustments that our salaried employees have made to working remotely. With that in mind, our salaried employees will work from home until further notice. We have begun to see the favorable impact of our aggressive cost reduction initiatives. As I mentioned, we believe these initiatives will provide the stability necessary to minimize negative operating cash outflow in the near term. We are working closely with our customers to run production as needed to meet their schedules. Our assumptions include a significant decrease level of production for the remainder of 2020 and we will evaluate and implement additional cost actions with a focus on minimizing operating cash flow in the near term. As we now turn our attention to the longer term outlook for the company, we are evaluating the appropriate strategies for a global environment where demand for our products may be weak for many quarters. We plan to provide you with a longer term outlook for fiscal 2021 and our M2022 planned performance on our third quarter earnings call if there is a set of market forecasts that we are comfortable with for modeling purposes. This outlook will include a summation of the benefits we expect to see from the longer term actions we're in the planning phase of executing. While the pandemic created a situation unlike any we have faced in the past with the full repercussions as yet unknown, we are taking the actions we believe will put the company in the best position for the long term. I want to thank Meritor employees for their focus during this unprecedented crisis. Our employees' dedication and responsiveness to customers and to each other has been overwhelming. Now, we'll take your questions. Joe, this is Jay. Thanks, very good question. Obviously, that was what I was referring to in my comments. We think the aggressive actions we took including 40% to 50% to 60% salary reductions in a very short order allowed us the time to sit back and say what is the longer term impact of this crisis look like to Meritor. And what additional actions should we take that can allow us to be successful throughout what potentially could be a longer term downturn. So we are looking at strategies as I mentioned in my comments and beginning to execute them that. We think we'll set our cost structure on the right basis for what we would expect to see for fiscal year 2021 and beyond. Well, I think it \u2013 it's, it's difficult for us to say in the near-term. And you heard the comments from our customers who have their calls, so far, they \u2013 they've been very reticent to project what the outlook looks like in future. And I think that goes for us as well. What I believe and what our team is working on is, is as you mentioned is setting up to plan for the worst and hope for the best and make sure we retain the capabilities in the company to respond to the aggressive snapback that ultimately will occur most likely in long quarters time as it always does and we're going to make certain we retain that expertise to be as successful as we have been and capturing the value on that snapback and those volumes. Good question, Alex. And we're using the same playbook that we put in place during the 2008-2009 recession where we immediately put up a multi-discipline team together including finance, purchasing, supply chain, manufacturing expertise to do much more active monitoring of suppliers, particularly those who we think do not have the balance sheets that may provide them enough liquidity through this time period. So far, we have not seen any disruptions, but we're monitoring it extremely closely and that playbook that we did execute in 2008-2009 was very successful for us. Included in that is engagement of outside experts that we can send in to the suppliers to assist them with operational and financial challenges that we've already locked those same experts into agreements if they are necessary. Yes. We have a much smaller relationship here through our aftermarket business as a distributor for certain products. But it, it, I, I don't want to misrepresent it, it's a fraction of what the business was previously. And those expected revenues are embedded in our outlook for the third quarter. That's a very good question, Alex. I think it gets around the broader question as obviously there will be M&A opportunities that present themselves through this crisis for people who maybe don't operate as well or have the financial wherewithal to withstand the downturn. At this point in time, we are focused to make certain that our company operates successfully as it's currently configured. And we like the growth prospects of the company in areas like electrification, like our recent off highway acquisition of AxleTech, so we didn't see a burning need to add bolt-on acquisitions at this time. Now as we come out of the crisis, if there is just some incredible opportunity on the landscape and we see our revenues growing during that time period we may revisit at that time. And just adding to Carl's comment, I think one of the benefits we got with also the layered capacity costs coming down is also a benefit from not seeing the premium freight costs associated with all of that. So we have seen some benefit both from the layered capacity as well as the premium freight. And I think in terms of the overall cost of purchase components versus our own internal cost there's also the benefit that we're seeing from that as well. Yes. It's a very good question, Jason. Obviously, I think it's a question on the industry spend where this will be viewed as something that can be deferred to preserve capital. But so far all of the programs we're associated with particularly the largest program, the PACCAR program, it remains on schedule. I've had technical updates with the PACCAR team recently. Our products are performing extremely well and so we see no sign that our customers not too dissimilar from us are not continuing to prioritize that spend. And as Chris mentioned in one of his comments, this is one area with all the cost reductions we've made both on the CapEx and expense side. We are retaining our investments in electrification and we continually continue to respond to active code opportunities and still look at this year to be a very big year for us. I think it's really almost entirely based on the lack of visibility on the OE manufacturing side. So if you take the business that your questions, Carl, you were just discussing the aftermarket business and Industrial that represents roughly a 50% of our expected revenue in that guidance. So if you took the remaining revenue, we have almost a 50% range of aftermath on the truck OE business. And I think that's very consistent with what we're hearing from our customers both in our private discussions and what you've heard them discussed publicly as they've released their earnings. It's just - it's a very opaque visibility window right now and after this quarter. And so that's why we put as wide range on revenue as we did. But understand this revenue estimate was important for us internally as well because it gave us the markers on which we have to manage the business to achieve our objectives of having the operating cash outflow be a very limited amount. I don't think where we're providing that level of guidance just given the volatility, I mentioned on the revenue outlook. But what I would make note of is included in that downside sequential guidance is the incremental cost of providing the safety materials that we need to ramp up our production such as masks, face shields, sanitary products, positional cleaning. So there is some incremental cost that's being incurred right now that's outside our norms in running the business."

            "name": "ChrisVillavarayan",
            "content": "Sure. Good morning, Alex. I think you know me, this is Chris Villavarayan. If you look at it, for example last quarter we talked about launching our or building a new facility in Brazil where we were looking at making a significant investment. As we see the current market, we might look at for example slowing down on that investment and just really modeling out where we see the market snapback and then making decisions like that. We are very definitely proceeding with the long-term prospects for Brazil, but in the short term, we might look at slowing down our investment. Also when you think about sustaining investments through our facility imagine for markets that we're running almost 60% to 70% from where we forecast, you could look and make decisions in the short-term on what we do. However, I think one thing that, Jay, is driving that as we think of the long term strategy in terms of investment in electrification, we are not slowing down on that process and as he also mentioned in how we are running the facilities and delivering the proportion or the systems we are continuing our investments into TransPower as well as electrification for the next quarter. And maybe I'll take this one Ryan, just you know as you can see that we're not giving much guidance beyond the next quarter. Again, it's from the perspective that we are seeing from our customers as well. But at a very high level, let's just break it down into maybe the three areas. And if you think about aftermarket and we've looked through last quarter as well as you know what we're seeing at least in the short-term window, aftermarket is obviously holding well you know when you think about 75% of the products that we use to travel by truck. The aftermarket seems to be holding strong. We see a slight weakening but nothing that's dramatic in the near future. Moving to the specialty defense of highway space. As I think Carl pointed out, we have noticed, you know, we did notice at the back end of that order board was getting weaker, we could say maybe about 20%, 30% but nothing of significance obviously consistent demand on that side and we got to see how that plays out. The truck market is obviously the big one as we see the customers coming up in April or late April and early May, that's where we're going to probably see what the real order boards come in. So, we \u2013 all the customers will be up of you know as we see most will be up as up May 4. So that would be probably a good time to see a perspective. But then breaking it up by region maybe I'll just address in that way China, you know as, as you all of you know I think we've seen a quick V and markets are back now whether that will hold up is all based on stimulus. And then India and South America are still under a pretty hard shut down and so time will tell how those two markets will come up. But in those two markets, inventories were low as you know with the FX. And the other two markets have addressed previously, I think we just have to see where our customers come back at."

            "name": "Carl Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Jay, and good morning. On today's call I'll review our second quarter financial results, liquidity position, debt maturity profile and retirement related liabilities. Before I begin, I wanted to take an opportunity to express how proud I'm of our team's ability to quickly mobilize and rise to the challenges, which have been placed before us. Now, let's walk through our second quarter financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 6. Overall, sales were $871 million, down 25% from the same period last year. Sales in our commercial truck segment decreased by 33% year-over-year to $588 million. The decrease in revenue was in line with global truck market conditions as all regions saw lower production levels. The suspension of production due to COVID-19 first in China in mid-January and then late March in Europe also contributed to lower sales. In our Aftermarket, Industrial and Trailer segment sales was $319 million, down $10 million or 3% from last year. Lower sales were primarily driven by decreased volumes across the segment including the beginning impacts of COVID-19 and overall market demand, partially offset by $43 million in revenue generated from our AxleTech business. Net income from continuing operations attributable to the company was $240 million compared to $73 million in the same period last year. As Jay mentioned higher net income year-over-year was driven by $203 million of after tax income associated with the termination of the aftermarket distribution arrangement with WABCO. Adjusted EBITDA was $107 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to $139 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.3% compared to 12% a year ago. The improvement in margin was largely driven by a $10 million adjustment of lower incentive compensation expense to align with the revised performance expectations due to COVID-19. We also recognized the $4 million benefit resulting from a tax law change in India. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $55 million, down $33 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck came in at 9.4%, down from 10% in the prior year. The decrease in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin were driven primarily by lower volumes, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs, lower net steel cost, and other material costs. Segment adjusted EBITDA in our Aftermarket, Industrial and Trailer segment was $49 million, a decrease of $3 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 40 basis points to 15.4%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $292 million compared to $19 million in the same period last year. The increase in free cash flow was driven primarily by the $265 million of cash received from WABCO. Next, I'll review the debt governs of revolving credit facility on Slide 7. The credit facility as the sole financial covenant based on priority debt which is a subset of our total outstanding debt. The calculation states priority debt cannot exceed trailing 12-month compliance EBITDA by more than 2.25x. It is important to note, the $265 million pretax income we recorded associated with the WABCO termination is included in trailing 12-month compliance EBITDA. Now let me walk you through the calculation in detail. First, priority debt is comprised of any outstanding borrowings under the revolver inclusive of any term loan funding, any outstanding US factoring and US securitization balances plus any secured lien for us consists of our capital leases. In total, priority debt as of the second quarter was $633 million. Secondly, priority debt as compared to trailing 12 months compliance EBITDA which starts with consolidated net income and then added back our depreciation, amortization, interest in taxes. Including other minor adjustments, the total 12 months trailing compliance EBITDA at the end of the second quarter was $701 million. The results in ratio are 0.9x priority debt compared to compliance EBITDA significantly under the limit of 2.25x. Furthermore, the covenant is only measured on the last day of each quarter. If compliance is achieved, the covenant is being met for the entire following quarter. As the income from the WABCO termination will be included in our priority debt calculation for four fiscal quarter is going forward, at this time, we expect to be in compliance with our covenant throughout the year and maintain access to the full credit facility. Let's move to Slide 8, which details our extended debt maturity profile and retirement liabilities. As you can see on the chart on the left, we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. In fact, we only have $4 million of debt coming due for the remainder of this year and $32 million in total debt maturities in fiscal year 2021. You will note in fiscal year 2023, we saw the maturity for our US securitization facility. We typically extend this facility annually for an additional year, which we would expect to do again later this year. The bottom line is that we have a clear runway with our debt maturities with no significant cause on cash through 2024. At the end of 2019, our net pension liability was a $122 million, which translated to a 93% overall funded status. Based on this, we expect very manageable required contributions over the next couple of years. And while we have obviously seen challenging financial markets as we ended the second quarter, our estimated funding status has actually improved from the end of 2019. This has been driven by a combination of strong US asset returns in the plan, which are up over 10% through March and higher discount rates as corporate spreads have widened. While our plans will continue to be susceptible to changes in asset returns and discount rates as we move through the remainder of the year. Our asset allocation is skewed more towards fixed income given our liability hedging strategy. Overall, we are pleased with the performance to date. Turning to our OPEB liability, as we have previously discussed we have taken steps in recent years to significantly reduce this obligation. At the end of 2019, this liability was only $67 million. Overall with an extended debt maturity profile and well-funded pension plan, we don't have any significant cost and cash from these liabilities in the near-term. In summary, the balance sheet actions we have executed over the last several years along with our current liquidity position makes us well-positioned to navigate the current environment. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Jay. Yes. Good morning, Joe. Good to talk to you as well. Yes, as I think we look at the next quarter. One this, what we provided was a sequential look relative to the second quarter. I think when you cut through the math on a year-over-year basis it gets - it's kind of running a little bit in the low 20% range. And as far as we look specifically for the second quarter, as you pointed out we did benefit from lower incentive comps in our actuals, as well as the - in the one-time kind of tax impact that ran through EBITDA. Good questions. This is Carl Anderson. Just on your first question as relates to Commercial Truck, as we look at those layered capacity cost for the most part those have pretty much been eliminated in the second quarter. We did have some that pretty much been eliminated in the second quarter. We did have some that carried a little bit in the first quarter. And as we go forward as we're kind of back in ramp up mode depending on the supply chains, you could see a little bit maybe some incremental cost kind of coming in over the next couple of quarters, but nowhere near where we were running last year with a high truck markets kind of at that point. And then as relates to your aftermarket question. I think the AxleTech business, I think; we're very pleased with the amount of synergies we've been able to achieve as it relates to that. One thing that's running a little bit softer than initial plan is just overall revenue for that business. And so I think the margins aren't exactly where we want them to be currently, but as you know over time as revenue begins hopefully at some point pick up, I think we're going to be in good position with an acquisition in that business. Yes. Good morning, Ryan. It's Carl. Good question. You know I think that the factoring unwind is really \u2013 it's really that's a function of having a lot lower sales especially - really in Europe where we are utilizers of the supply chain financing program. So it's - if the unwind is just more, it's more natural because we're not able to sell receivables in normal course because the sales are a lot lower. The real impact is just because you have a timing mismatch as far as obviously the payables need to kind of run off in the working capital perspective. And you are unable to sell new receivables. So yes, it is consistent with what we kind of provided back in the March 25, March 25th 8-K that we put out as well. Yes. Thanks, James. Yes. I mean I think what you're seeing from the WABCO income, yes, it is included in the trailing 12-month calculation. And so as I was highlighting that we're kind of carry through for the next really four quarters as well as we look to calculate the overall compliance to EBITDA. So as we look at what's in front of us not only third quarter but for the rest of this year, our expectation is we will not have any issues with our debt covenant and we feel that coupled with the overall liquidity of the company. So with the amount of cash on hand I think we're in a pretty good spot to be able to manage the current environment. Yes. That's exactly right. And so that's how we're characterizing it. There is, we'll call it a one-time impact at a sales levels dropped significantly based on the lower production volume. But as the fourth quarter, if there is some pick up and production kind of comes back, you will see the cash benefits at that point in time. I think that's early - That's a good way to think about. I think the last quarter that we had a guided about $115 million of CapEx. So it's probably closer in the $80 million, $85 million range at this point as we think for the remainder \u2013 for the full year. So that kind of around 3% is probably the right way to think about it. No. I would say on the synergy side in AxleTech, we're coming in right on plan and actually we're looking and we feel very good with all the actions that we have been able to take since we acquired the company last year. You know there is a reference, obviously, we are seeing some softness in overall just revenue levels, specifically in the off-highway market, as well as in aftermarket. So overall the margin performance is still probably not where we want it to be, but a lot of that now is driven more on the revenue side as opposed to any of the cost actions that we've taken to date. Yes, it was about $43 million, so very consistent with what we saw in the first quarter as well. Good morning, Faheem. You know I think one of the things that's in there is the impact from the WABCO, agreement being, our distribution agreement being terminated and so prior to the crisis that was a probably a book of business about a $115 million. So you are seeing a headwind now in this quarter that we're in as well and that will continue on as we kind of go forward. So a significant piece of that really relates to that particular business. Well, again I would say, we've not kind of given line by line guidance on the revenue, but I would just say the first two quarters that we've seen this year in AxleTech has been running a little bit north of $40 million of revenue. And I would expect - we don't expect probably some little bit further softness for a period of time for that business."

Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Craig: Thanks Todd. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid first quarter and have a number of highlights we would like to share with you today. Let's look at Slide 3, which provides an overview. I am especially pleased that we continue to perform well despite production volumes being down year-over-year in most of our global end markets. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.9% and we generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.64. As markets have weakened, we have taken steps to manage cost and maintain a downside conversion of 15% which is at the lower end of our expected range of 15% to 20%. We are effectively managing what we can control considering the cyclical nature of our business and the rapid declines in virtually all of global end markets, continuing our track record of operational excellence. In the first several months of the fiscal year, we continued to execute our share repurchase program, finalized a meaningful new electrification agreement with Paccar, were added to the S&P 600 small-cap index, enhanced our technology and product portfolios and appointed Chris Villavarayan, Chief Operating Officer. As you saw in the press release announcing Chris's appointment, he has been with Meritor for 20 years in various leadership roles. In each of those positions, he has excelled and has made significant contributions toward achieving the targets we set forth both in M2016 and 2019. Global operating responsibility for both of Meritor's business segments was the next appropriate step for Chris and critical to leadership development for our team as we move forward. Notably, Meritor's electrification business is transitioning to low-volume production more quickly than we anticipated as adoption of battery electric commercial vehicles increases globally. This is demonstrated by the new business award we announced today with Paccar. Meritor is providing customers with a range of electric powertrain technology including fully integrated system solutions. We are confident that our differentiated offerings are establishing Meritor as a leader in the industry. With Chris's transition to Chief Operating Officer, I will be personally dedicating more time to electrification as we expand product development, integrate TransPower and grow our customer base. I look forward to having more direct involvement in refining and executing our strategic plan as we go to market with our blue horizon portfolio that serves global customers in many different applications. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a capital allocation update. On our last earnings call mid-November, we noted that we have repurchased $60 million of shares as part of our planned $300 million share repurchase program for fiscal year 2020. Since that time, we have repurchased an additional $140 million of shares for a total of 8.8 million shares purchased effectively completing two thirds of the 2020 program. Late last fiscal year, we exercised our option to terminate the aftermarket distribution arrangement with Fabco. We now expect to complete that transaction in this quarter with proceeds anticipated to be at the high-end of the $225 million to $265 million range we previously disclosed. As a result, we accelerated $200 million of repurchases in the first four months of this fiscal year. As we have said, we believe that committing capital towards significant share repurchases is one of the primary ways we intend to achieve our shareholder return objectives under M2022. On Slide 5 we highlighted variety of products introduced in the quarter. These new offerings further demonstrate that we continue to expand our portfolio maintaining the aggressive new product launch cadence initiated under our M plans. As part of M2022, we have a clear view toward maintaining our leading market share positions with best in class products and services. We are introducing new products including our single piston air disc break in our range of high-efficiency axles. This includes a new vocational axle that is the first of its type in decades. We are also bringing to market the lightest weight trailer suspension in the industry providing 23,000 pound capacity for tankers, flatbeds and other demanding vocational applications. Let's take a look at Slide 6, first I am pleased to announce today that we were selected as Paccar supplier of electric powertrain for and Peter [ph] and heavy duty battery electric vehicles. Production is targeted to begin in 2021. We are very excited about this opportunity with such an important customer. As you know, we have had a long-standing relationship with Paccar and look forward to expanding the scope of that collaboration. Additionally, Meritor has also delivered six blue horizon electric powertrains to Daimler Trucks North America for it's EM2 innovation fleet. These are being manufactured in one of our facilities in North Carolina. We continue to be a leader in electrification for the commercial vehicle industry and are positioning the company for long-term success by expanding our product portfolio and technology capabilities. Last year we announced in addition to the 14XE, we will begin development of the medium duty 12XE and the 17XE for heavy duty application primarily in Europe. And as you heard last week, we've acquired the remaining voting equity interest in TransPower for $16 million, expanding our offering to include full EV integration capability that enables us to continue delivering complete battery electric systems to our OEM customers. As I've said, the pace of investment and opportunities in this space is accelerating more quickly than we originally foresaw and we believe this will result in additional production awards for us over the next 12 months. Today our book of expected business is greater than $200 million and growing. We also have line of sight to other potential production awards that could drive our revenue pipeline north of $500 million, which we expect to be profitable as production ramps up in fiscal 2021. As we are successful in finalizing these opportunities, we will be sure to update you. Overall, I believe we have tremendous opportunities in front of us and I'm very pleased with how we are positioned in electrification. On Slide 7, I wanted to highlight our investment to build a manufacturing facility in Brazil. As we see the region continue to recover and grow, this is the right time for us to optimize our footprint. This project is one of the largest manufacturing cost reduction programs in M2022 and will help us achieve our margin objective. As we mentioned last quarter we are happy to be part of the e-Consortium with Volkswagen in Brazil, which provides us with the opportunity to supply axles for E delivery vehicles. As we look at the quarter, I'm pleased with our performance as we navigate end market volumes that are significantly lower on a year-over-year basis. We have a strong balance sheet that provides us with significant financial flexibility. Our increased free cash flow generation provides us with the opportunities to continue returning value to our shareholders through our share repurchase plan while we also invest in our core product portfolio and electrification business. The company is well positioned to deliver strong growth, margin improvement and robust free cash flow generation under M2022. With that I'll turn the call over to Carl for more detail on the financials.\nCarl Anderson: Thanks Jay and good morning. On today's call I'll review our first quarter financial results and updated full-year guidance. Overall, as you heard from Jay, we delivered a solid start to 2020. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.64, reflecting our ability to manage the business effectively across current end market conditions. Additionally, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and in the first four months of the fiscal year, we have repurchased over 10% of outstanding shares. This reflects our continued confidence in achieving and delivering on our M2022 targets. Let's walk through the details by turning to Slide 8 where you'll see our first quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $901 million in the quarter down $137 million from a year ago driven primarily by lower global truck production and lower volumes across your other businesses. This was partially offset by revenue from AxleTech, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019. As anticipated we saw a significant decrease in North America Class 8 production in the first quarter. Compared to the same period last year, production was down almost 17,000 units or about 20%. Additionally in Europe, production was down approximately 18,000 units or 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and in India, production volumes which were down almost 40% continued to be impacted by the emission standard changeover that will occur on April 1, which requires all vehicles sold after this date to comply with the new standards. This is resulting in an industry-wide focus of reducing inventory levels prior to the changeover. Additionally, we are seeing tighter credit conditions which is also contributing to the market challenges and finally revenue from AxleTech helped to offset slowing market conditions in our North America aftermarket specialty and trailer businesses. Looking at the right side of the page, we did a good job of managing cost to limit total downside earning conversion to 15% on the lower revenue. Lower volume decreased sales by $127 million or 12% from last year. On this revenue decline, adjusted EBITDA decreased $17 million or 14%. Our ability to manage cost on lower revenue was highlighted this quarter as we were able to drive lower material, labor and operating [ph] expense which resulted in very solid downside conversion performance. In addition foreign exchange was a slight headwind on sales as the US dollar had strengthen year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was unfavorably impacted by $4 million compared to the prior year. Overall, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $98 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9%. Looking at the left-hand side of the chart, gross margin came in at 14.1% this quarter an increase of 50 basis points from a year ago. This improvement was mainly driven by lower overall material costs including reduced layered capacity cost. You also recall, we announced a restructuring plan at the end of fiscal year last September. The plan was implemented in anticipation of the slowing market conditions we are now experiencing. As a result we did recognize $5 million related to the restructuring in the first quarter. As we move down the table on the left, you'll see that we're reporting $39 million of GAAP net income from continuing operations. In addition to lower sales compared to last year in fiscal 2019 we recognized a $31 million gain from the remeasurement of the Maremont asbestos liability, which did not repeat. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $52 million resulting in $0.64 per adjusted diluted share. And finally free cash was negative $35 million this quarter compared to negative $12 million in the same period last year. As you may recall, we typically use cash in the first quarter due to fewer selling days as a result of the holiday season which generally drives lower revenues and incentive compensation payments for achieve performance in 2019. Let's move to Slide 9, which details our first quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for our reporting segments. In our commercial truck segment, sales decreased by 20% to $622 million. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower truck production across most regions in the segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $56 million, down $21 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck came in at 9% down from 9.9% in the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily by lower volumes, partially offset by lower freight and material cost, including reduced net steel and layer capacity cost. Lower labor and burden cost also contributed to managing to 13% downside conversion on the lower revenue in the segment. In our aftermarket industrial and trailer segment, sales were $370 million up $14 million or 5% from last year. The increase in sales was primarily driven by revenue from AxleTech, partially offset by decreased volumes across the segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $40 million which was flat compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 60 basis points to 12.6%. The decrease was driven primarily by the impact from AxleTech as the expected benefit from synergies continues to ramp up to full run rate. Next I'll review our updated fiscal year 2020 global market outlook on Slide 10. We are revising production levels for India to between 265,000 to 285,000 units down over 15% from our prior outlook. Based on the market uncertainty we're seeing in this region, it is likely that the production levels after April 1 may not fully compensate for the lower production levels we are seeing now. In Europe, we're lowering our production outlook by 5,000 reflecting slightly lower truck demand and finally we are revising our outlook for the US trailer market to approximately 230,000 units to 240,000 units as we are now forecasting the trailer market to decrease more in line with Class 8 truck production. On the next slide, we provide a summary of our 2020 guidance based on these updated market assumptions. We now expect revenue to be approximately $3.7 million which is at the lower end of our previously provided guidance. We're also revising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin to 11%. We expect to manage our downside revenue conversion at the low-end of our expected range through our laser focus on managing cost. As a result of the slightly lower expectations, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be approximately $2.75 which is consistent with the low-end of our previous guidance. And finally, we now expect to generate free cash flow of $165 million this year. While we cannot control the global markets, we are pleased with our team's ability to quickly adjust to market changes and delivered solid financial results as we begin our M2022 plan. Now we'll take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.\nFaheem Sabeiha: Hi. Good morning, guys and thanks for taking my questions and Chris, congrats on the promotion. Jay you mentioned the $500 million revenue opportunity for the EV portfolio, but I was wondering what's baked into your guide this year and I guess what does the ramp look like over the next few years.\nJay Craig: As I mentioned in my comments, the production of the Paccar work begins next year. So we're wrapping up our capabilities on the manufacturing side particularly at TransPower to deliver those vehicles beginning in 2021 and then we see them reach what we would call full production rate during 2022.\nFaheem Sabeiha: Okay. And can you talk about the revenue content of these EV systems on the Paccar trucks plus the other platforms you expect to go live on versus your contents on a diesel engine. I just want to understanding what the profitability looks like on these projects.\nJay Craig: We're not disclosing specifics on that right now but the way you could think about it is this is somewhere between prototype and low-volume production. So the prices are quite a bit higher than we would expect when it reaches full production. So even though the range we gave at our last Analyst Day of 5 to 10 times the content when we got to full production mode these particular content levels are quite a bit higher than that because we're still somewhat at the prototype stage of these volumes.\nFaheem Sabeiha: Okay. And is there any white space left in the portfolio and EV portfolio or are there other services or offerings that Meritor is maybe eyeing that would increase the EV value proposition of the customer at this point?\nJay Craig: Absolutely. As I mentioned in the comments, really twofold, we're thrilled with our purchase of the remaining equity at TransPower. We think that integration capabilities have significant growth opportunities for us in all different types of applications, be them medium duty refuse, school buses, heavy-duty, so a lot of white space growth. But just as importantly, I discussed our intent to launch our 17Xe and 17Xe electric exile. Right now we're running with just the 14Xe and those other two actual offerings will bring us into different market segments.\nOperator: Thank you and our next question comes from James Picariello with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.\nJames Picariello: So just at a high level regarding the guidance, is the generalization here that we're seeing some additional weakening across US trailers, Europe, India and you're still delivering a mid-teens on just that modest weakening in the markets that you're seeing?\nCarl Anderson: James, it's Carl. I think that's right. I think if you look at the guidance, the markets we did take down are what your referenced. We're still seeing North America come in relatively consistent with what we thought previously and it's really just the capabilities and ability for us to manage the cost structure to be at that lower end of our downside conversion levels of that -- around that 15% and that's what we're really managing the company to.\nJames Picariello: Got it. And then can you just talk about what the status of your internal actions are with respect to, is the restructuring plan completely finalized now and then maybe just some other cost-our initiatives that help support the margin resilience for the year and also how are commodities trending?\nJay Craig: You would expect James company operating in deeply cyclical environments that we do. We're constantly looking at our cost structure really with the target to try and convert if we can at the lower end of that conversion guidance that we provide of 15% to 20%. Obviously we're successful in doing that this first quarter in spite of this being a quarter of our resolve rapid ramp downs in production. While we're continuously looking at actions that we could potentially take to manage that very volatile volume environment.\nJames Picariello: Okay. And is the status of the restructuring plan is that completely finalized or do you still have some more work to do?\nJay Craig: Again we are still -- there are of the previous restructuring plan we announced that is virtually complete, but again we continue to monitor our cost structure and if we see further declines in our market expectations, we will have to take additional cost actions but I believe we've established a track record over the last half dozen years of being very good at reacting to that very, very quickly.\nJames Picariello: Got it. Appreciate it. And then just on AxleTech and maybe I missed this, so my apologies, but what was the contribution in the quarter for AxleTech and how are you thinking about the full-year in terms of the revenue and the synergies that should be realized for AxleTech this year?\nCarl Anderson: Yes, James, it\u2019s Carl. If you look at the AxleTech revenue, we had about $43 million of revenue from AxleTech. I think what we're seeing, as it relates to the synergies expectations we\u2019re actually kind of above our internal planning from an expectation what we -- that we're delivering on. I think the business itself, we're seeing some general softness just like you're seeing whether it's in the Highway, defense and aftermarket kind of areas of the business which is similar to what we're seeing with the rest of Meritor\u2019s business. But I would say overall, we continue to be very pleased with the strategy and with the acquisition of the company. I think revenue is a little bit softer than what we\u2019re originally planning, if we had the discussion six months ago, but overall, what we're very pleased with is really just the team's ability to execute on the synergy plan and where we stand at this point.\nJames Picariello: Got it, thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nAlex Potter: Hi, guys. Interested in digging in, I guess maybe a little bit more on this EV opportunity with PACCAR. I guess what I'm trying to understand is once this is in run rate production, are you primarily going to be providing them with eAxles, drivetrain components or is it going to be something that flows through TransPower, these fully electrified chassis type products? Thanks.\nCarl Anderson: Okay, good question, Alex. The short answer is both. So, that's the beauty of the investment in TransPower is we truly felt that two plus two equals three or four in the Meritor products and the customer relationships we brought could be added with TransPower\u2019s capabilities on in that they're able to provide them the full integration for an electric vehicle. So we will be working now with our wholly owned subsidiary of TransPower on providing fully integrated electric vehicles for PACCAR. And they will be composed also where we can have have Meritor components including eAxles on some of the vehicles.\nAlex Potter: Okay, thanks, I guess I mean the reason I asked the question is I think you may agree or maybe not, with that. But eventually presumably once electric vehicle penetration reaches a certain threshold, the truck manufacturers themselves are going to have to decide what they view as core and what they're going to rely on the supply chain for. And I got to believe that at some point, they'll take some of that content and do it internally. Maybe that's not the case in the sort of quasi prototype space but I don't know what's your view on when you think the OEMs said on that line differently?\nCarl Anderson: No, I think as we've spoken before we couldn't agree with you more, that's fine. We've taken what we've labeled an open architecture model towards our work primarily out of TransPower, where we work very closely with our OE\u2019s development teams and work with them on what capabilities they will eventually want to in-source. And as we've mentioned specifically, as an example, we're looking forward to them in sourcing the battery sourcing and battery management systems. We're doing that right now. But we expect that they will integrate that over time because they have actually greater scale for purchasing of those. But offsetting that decline in revenue on that end will be two different items on the other side, coming up which is one are eAxles which were developing and getting to full run rate production will begin to be placed on more vehicles with significantly more content than a traditional axle. And then secondarily, there will be a segment of the market that won't have the scale that will be able to execute all the integration services. So we will be providing those as our technology is proven.\nAlex Potter: Interesting. Okay, very good. That that makes good sense. I was wondering then outside of electrification, some of the other maybe more slightly more near-term growth initiatives that you've spoken about recently, thinking about things like off-highway precision gearing, maybe medium duty truck share disc brakes, pretty sure I'm omitting a couple more here as well. But if you could maybe just rank order those opportunities based on your recent experience, which ones are doing better than plan in line with plan and maybe some that are performing below expectations?\nJay Craig: What I'm going to do is, is like Chris, I wanted him to speak about this breaking opportunities, because we take they are significant, but obviously the biggest opportunity we have during this planning period through 2022 is the successful integration of AxleTech and making sure we garner all of those costs and revenue synergies, particularly as we focus on the off-highway military opportunities there. But I would Chris to also speak about the disc braking side.\nChris Villavarayan: Thanks, Jay and good morning, Alex. I think when you think about M22 and our target is $300 million of revenue. And as you look at our presentation, we talked about seven new products, and the one right in the middle is the disc brake, our single piston disc brake that we\u2019re launching. As we announced over a year-ago, we have a standard agreement on air disc brakes with Daimler. And we're looking as one customer and as we're growing here in the future, we plan to take this globally and grow the disc brakes. So the disc brake business is a considerable part of our growth strategy going forward.\nAlex Potter: Great, very good, thanks a lot guys.\nChris Villavarayan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBrian Johnson: Great, I both have kind of outlook kind of housekeeping question and then a more strategic question. In terms of just and I know you have hit in this before, but the commercial truck downside conversion was very strong at 15%. I was particularly struck by the how gross margins held in which would seem to imply that perhaps you're managing detrimentals on the SG&A OpEx side. Could you maybe talk about that or in particular with the gross margin get better, was there a commodity tailwind there?\nCarl Anderson: Yes, Brian it\u2019s Carl, I think you're right on the gross margin, what we did see is we did see some benefit from steel in the quarter, kind of similar in line what we talked about back in November as far as outlook for the full-year. So I would say steel was probably a mid single digit million tailwind for us in the quarter. We also had a pretty significant improvement in cost as it relates to labor and burden in the quarter as well as really managing kind of our freight expenses well. So it's really, it was a combination of all of those items which were all around kind of the same type of magnitude for the quarter in which we saw which helped really drive the improvement in gross margin for us.\nBrian Johnson: Okay, second question around what are you seeing in kind of the mid truck market in North America that gives you some greater confidence in both how it\u2019s held up and then how it's going to look over the coming year?\nCarl Anderson: Well, right now in terms of the market, I think we're in line with where we see, let's call it the external rating agencies coming in ACT and FTR between 240 to 250. And then on top of that, as I look at the line rates that we're seeing from our customers, I believe all those three are actually boxing in very closely. So we're quite comfortable with what we see going forward. Maybe your question on with respect to new trucks and where we see that going in the future, I think trucks are becoming far more efficient as we see. And obviously, we've seen over the last two years and with the path of electrification diesels got to get even more efficient. So I think that's one place where we've really play strongly. And so I think it's equally important because if you think about our high efficiency axles that we've launched recently as well as you know, the axles that we have coming, Jay talked about the new vocational axle, we really believe that the efficiency gain will drive it and I just want to clarify one point also on the forecast, it's 245,000 to 255,000.\nBrian Johnson: Okay, and then finally the PACCAR obviously prototype to look in its early days but then you talked about some things like battery management, how are you thinking about the software that would span across managing the flow from the battery, the flow through the power electronics, and then the actual control, the motors itself, is that something where you're whether it's some of the acquisitions you made, you're writing the software, or are you basically providing the hardware and the OEM partners doing the software?\nCarl Anderson: Very good question, Brian. I mean, that's why the TransPower investment and now the acquisition of the remaining equity was so critical, TransPower provides supervisory controls to the software in that area, that makes the whole system run including instrumentation on the vehicle, breaking all the other supervisory controls. They also provide the battery management controls that determine the energy rate of energy flow and the utilization of energy. So we do have software and software engineers at TransPower. In addition, we've ramped up within Meritor, our software engineering capability just to manage the features in the eAxle because that eAxle obviously containing motor components, cooling components requires a lot of software system intellectual properties. So we have an entire software team here in our Troy research center that's focused on the software on the eAxle as well.\nBrian Johnson: And as part of that, are you getting close loop data out of vehicles on the road that would allow you to refine the algorithms and control algorithms?\nCarl Anderson: Yes, we welcome any of our investors or analysts to come visit TransPower in San Diego and you can ride on the test vehicles with me and see how they operate. We have thousands and thousands of test miles on these vehicles right now.\nBrian Johnson: And any plan once those get on the road to continue to harvest the data, I\u2019m thinking here of last night and?\nCarl Anderson: Yes, continuously. Sorry for misunderstanding your question. But yes, it\u2019s true.\nBrian Johnson: Yes, I know, I'm thinking of the advantage the Tesla has in terms of getting for its BMS and control systems?\nCarl Anderson: Correct, although I think as we heard in a previous question, it is our expectation with the large OEs that they will start to take control of management of some of that data as well. And we're very open and working with them to enable them to do that.\nBrian Johnson: Okay, thank you.\nCarl Anderson: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nRyan Brinkman: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Clearly you have accelerated the share repurchases here, which as you've mentioned before, provides flexibility toward meeting those longer-term targets in a wider variety of macro scenarios. I'm curious though, just given that only $100 million remains whether you intend to pursue another authorization or what your plans might be after the current authorization is completed?\nCarl Anderson: Good morning, Ryan. It's Carl, I think you're absolutely right, we have $100 million left to go which the board has authorized us. And we've been in the first four months pretty aggressive in the share repurchases. We did signal last quarter that we have an opportunity in front of us over the next couple of years is related to what we're generating in free cash flow to repurchase up to potentially another 400 million of shares. And so I think our approach will be we'd like to fully execute and complete the existing program. But I would believe that once we do that, we'll be in a position to seek further authorization, especially where the stock is currently trading.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just on Slide 8 regarding that catch all volume mix performance, other category driver of EBITDA, I know you'd call it out your decremental track for the lower end of your targeted range, which indicates solid performance within that category. But are you just able to maybe disaggregate that bucket a little bit, what is electrification investment running within this category? And how are you thinking about the impact of performance or electrification investment for the full fiscal year?\nCarl Anderson: Yes, I think Ryan as we look at the quarter specifically, electrification really was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis at least in the first quarter, we do expect that to continue to ramp-up for the rest of this fiscal year. And I think what we were talking about, probably up about $10 million or so from a year-ago. So overall as it relates about that line item itself, when you kind of do the math is about 13% downside conversion with all the components but as we go forward, we do see this pickup and ramp up in electrification spend especially with the success we've had with the new PACCAR win as well as with the TransPower acquisition.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay, great. Just lastly from me regarding that new facility in Brazil, there's been some reticence to invest more capital in light vehicle capacity in that region on the part of suppliers. Can you just maybe talk a little bit? Why you're excited about this? Is it a case of increased localization, which helps to offset currency risk? Or also, I heard you say that it was a significant cost savings move. So maybe it's replacing some older, more expensive capacity anymore how to think about that would be helpful, thanks.\nChris Villavarayan: Yes, excellent, Ryan. This is Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that one. So I think you hit on two points that we've been in Brazil for several years, actually over 50 years. And our current location is landlocked, and we're unable to grow from that site. And the Brazilian market, as you could imagine, and you have seen through many of our quarters is a very important market for Meritor. And so we made the decision many years ago to make a long-term commitment here and we've been working on deciding a new facility here for over 10 years. And so with the market continuing to strengthen and we've seen it strengthened over the last four to five years are our thoughts are we need a new facility, we\u2019ll add more capacity and drive local content to your point also bring us closer to our customers and also drive the best-in-class cost. It provides us yet another opportunity, have to build a new facility that's more modernized and then continues to drive our cost position. So it is one of the largest as Jay pointed out, cost reduction opportunities in our M22 plan.\nRyan Brinkman: Great, it\u2019s very helpful. Thanks a lot.\nChris Villavarayan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Spak: Thanks, everyone. I guess first just on the aftermarket industrial trailer segment, so margins are down. You called out in some of the integration. You lowered your trailer outlook but then the synergies ran through the year. Like what do we expect margins for the year, for the whole year in that segment to be now like, can they be fired? Or should we sort of start modeling them down now given some of the incremental headwinds?\nCarl Anderson: Yes, I think, Joe what we are seeing, we definitely see a margin increase in kind of from the current run rate that we finished the first quarter in. The one thing to take into account is just the overall just general softness we're seeing across the segment, obviously, we talked trailers, but also with the industrial and off-highway parts of the business and aftermarket itself that we're seeing here in North America. We're just seeing some general softness, but our expectations, as you know, we don't give a number specifically for the year by this segment, but we definitely see that margin increasing progressing throughout the year.\nJoseph Spak: Driven by the synergies ramping on?\nCarl Anderson: Yes.\nJoseph Spak: Okay, Jay the TransPower full acquisition, not a surprise, I think you've sort of hinted or indicated this could be possible. But you've also been working very closely with them to-date. So like, just what specifically does sort of the full ownership allow you to do now that you weren't able to do before?\nJay Craig: Well, I think it's just overall the statement to the employee base there of how importantly are to Meritor. I think we're the perfect home for them. And what we've found in the period that we've had an investment in TransPower is those benefits are even greater than we originally estimated. And we each bring different skill sets. Obviously Meritor has over 100 year history of production for the commercial vehicle industry. And we can assist TransPower as they're moving from this low volume prototype stage to production stage. And we actually have a Head of Production that resides in San Diego and has for many months now. That's an executive of Meritor that is running the production floor. And TransPower brings to us the development expertise in this particular area and jump starts us as a full vehicle integrator. So I think overall, it's been a perfect marriage, the employees at TransPower that I meet are just thrilled to be part of Meritor. So I think it's just a natural progression.\nJoseph Spak: Okay, and then lastly from me, with the appointment of Chris to COO, very exciting and I appreciate Chris, all Chris's sort of comments and look forward to talking more with him. But you've also like been an operating story and operating at a very high level for some time. So what specifically did you see that led you to believe that now is the right time to have that role? And I guess I mean this in the most respectful way possible, but is there any element of succession planning in this decision as well?\nJay Craig: Well, to be honest, there's always elements of succession planning whenever anybody gets promoted. But I'm not saying that in any time in the foreseeable future, I see stepping away from the company. It's really twofold. Chris has really been my partner in time on the operating side. I was reading through my prepared remarks, almost everything related to the operating side of the product side. I would say Chris has either led or we've jointly led. So I think a lot of it is recognition of Chris\u2019s importance to the business. But secondarily also, as I've mentioned, the rate of the ramp-up of the electrification business has been much happened much more quickly than any of us anticipated. And those capital allocation decisions and other critical decisions around that business have really ended up flowing to my desk as you would expect, and I think it's the right time just for me to get more directly involved with that and make sure we're all aligned on those different decision points we have we encountered.\nJoseph Spak: Great, I really appreciate that color. Thank you.\nJay Craig: Okay, thank you.\nCarl Anderson: Thanks Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Todd Chirillo for any closing remarks.\nTodd Chirillo: Thank you for joining our call today. Please reach out to me directly, if you have any questions. Thank you and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jay Craig",
            "content": "Thanks Todd. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid first quarter and have a number of highlights we would like to share with you today. Let's look at Slide 3, which provides an overview. I am especially pleased that we continue to perform well despite production volumes being down year-over-year in most of our global end markets. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.9% and we generated adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.64. As markets have weakened, we have taken steps to manage cost and maintain a downside conversion of 15% which is at the lower end of our expected range of 15% to 20%. We are effectively managing what we can control considering the cyclical nature of our business and the rapid declines in virtually all of global end markets, continuing our track record of operational excellence. In the first several months of the fiscal year, we continued to execute our share repurchase program, finalized a meaningful new electrification agreement with Paccar, were added to the S&P 600 small-cap index, enhanced our technology and product portfolios and appointed Chris Villavarayan, Chief Operating Officer. As you saw in the press release announcing Chris's appointment, he has been with Meritor for 20 years in various leadership roles. In each of those positions, he has excelled and has made significant contributions toward achieving the targets we set forth both in M2016 and 2019. Global operating responsibility for both of Meritor's business segments was the next appropriate step for Chris and critical to leadership development for our team as we move forward. Notably, Meritor's electrification business is transitioning to low-volume production more quickly than we anticipated as adoption of battery electric commercial vehicles increases globally. This is demonstrated by the new business award we announced today with Paccar. Meritor is providing customers with a range of electric powertrain technology including fully integrated system solutions. We are confident that our differentiated offerings are establishing Meritor as a leader in the industry. With Chris's transition to Chief Operating Officer, I will be personally dedicating more time to electrification as we expand product development, integrate TransPower and grow our customer base. I look forward to having more direct involvement in refining and executing our strategic plan as we go to market with our blue horizon portfolio that serves global customers in many different applications. Let's turn to Slide 4 for a capital allocation update. On our last earnings call mid-November, we noted that we have repurchased $60 million of shares as part of our planned $300 million share repurchase program for fiscal year 2020. Since that time, we have repurchased an additional $140 million of shares for a total of 8.8 million shares purchased effectively completing two thirds of the 2020 program. Late last fiscal year, we exercised our option to terminate the aftermarket distribution arrangement with Fabco. We now expect to complete that transaction in this quarter with proceeds anticipated to be at the high-end of the $225 million to $265 million range we previously disclosed. As a result, we accelerated $200 million of repurchases in the first four months of this fiscal year. As we have said, we believe that committing capital towards significant share repurchases is one of the primary ways we intend to achieve our shareholder return objectives under M2022. On Slide 5 we highlighted variety of products introduced in the quarter. These new offerings further demonstrate that we continue to expand our portfolio maintaining the aggressive new product launch cadence initiated under our M plans. As part of M2022, we have a clear view toward maintaining our leading market share positions with best in class products and services. We are introducing new products including our single piston air disc break in our range of high-efficiency axles. This includes a new vocational axle that is the first of its type in decades. We are also bringing to market the lightest weight trailer suspension in the industry providing 23,000 pound capacity for tankers, flatbeds and other demanding vocational applications. Let's take a look at Slide 6, first I am pleased to announce today that we were selected as Paccar supplier of electric powertrain for and Peter [ph] and heavy duty battery electric vehicles. Production is targeted to begin in 2021. We are very excited about this opportunity with such an important customer. As you know, we have had a long-standing relationship with Paccar and look forward to expanding the scope of that collaboration. Additionally, Meritor has also delivered six blue horizon electric powertrains to Daimler Trucks North America for it's EM2 innovation fleet. These are being manufactured in one of our facilities in North Carolina. We continue to be a leader in electrification for the commercial vehicle industry and are positioning the company for long-term success by expanding our product portfolio and technology capabilities. Last year we announced in addition to the 14XE, we will begin development of the medium duty 12XE and the 17XE for heavy duty application primarily in Europe. And as you heard last week, we've acquired the remaining voting equity interest in TransPower for $16 million, expanding our offering to include full EV integration capability that enables us to continue delivering complete battery electric systems to our OEM customers. As I've said, the pace of investment and opportunities in this space is accelerating more quickly than we originally foresaw and we believe this will result in additional production awards for us over the next 12 months. Today our book of expected business is greater than $200 million and growing. We also have line of sight to other potential production awards that could drive our revenue pipeline north of $500 million, which we expect to be profitable as production ramps up in fiscal 2021. As we are successful in finalizing these opportunities, we will be sure to update you. Overall, I believe we have tremendous opportunities in front of us and I'm very pleased with how we are positioned in electrification. On Slide 7, I wanted to highlight our investment to build a manufacturing facility in Brazil. As we see the region continue to recover and grow, this is the right time for us to optimize our footprint. This project is one of the largest manufacturing cost reduction programs in M2022 and will help us achieve our margin objective. As we mentioned last quarter we are happy to be part of the e-Consortium with Volkswagen in Brazil, which provides us with the opportunity to supply axles for E delivery vehicles. As we look at the quarter, I'm pleased with our performance as we navigate end market volumes that are significantly lower on a year-over-year basis. We have a strong balance sheet that provides us with significant financial flexibility. Our increased free cash flow generation provides us with the opportunities to continue returning value to our shareholders through our share repurchase plan while we also invest in our core product portfolio and electrification business. The company is well positioned to deliver strong growth, margin improvement and robust free cash flow generation under M2022. With that I'll turn the call over to Carl for more detail on the financials. As I mentioned in my comments, the production of the Paccar work begins next year. So we're wrapping up our capabilities on the manufacturing side particularly at TransPower to deliver those vehicles beginning in 2021 and then we see them reach what we would call full production rate during 2022. We're not disclosing specifics on that right now but the way you could think about it is this is somewhere between prototype and low-volume production. So the prices are quite a bit higher than we would expect when it reaches full production. So even though the range we gave at our last Analyst Day of 5 to 10 times the content when we got to full production mode these particular content levels are quite a bit higher than that because we're still somewhat at the prototype stage of these volumes. Absolutely. As I mentioned in the comments, really twofold, we're thrilled with our purchase of the remaining equity at TransPower. We think that integration capabilities have significant growth opportunities for us in all different types of applications, be them medium duty refuse, school buses, heavy-duty, so a lot of white space growth. But just as importantly, I discussed our intent to launch our 17Xe and 17Xe electric exile. Right now we're running with just the 14Xe and those other two actual offerings will bring us into different market segments. You would expect James company operating in deeply cyclical environments that we do. We're constantly looking at our cost structure really with the target to try and convert if we can at the lower end of that conversion guidance that we provide of 15% to 20%. Obviously we're successful in doing that this first quarter in spite of this being a quarter of our resolve rapid ramp downs in production. While we're continuously looking at actions that we could potentially take to manage that very volatile volume environment. Again we are still -- there are of the previous restructuring plan we announced that is virtually complete, but again we continue to monitor our cost structure and if we see further declines in our market expectations, we will have to take additional cost actions but I believe we've established a track record over the last half dozen years of being very good at reacting to that very, very quickly. What I'm going to do is, is like Chris, I wanted him to speak about this breaking opportunities, because we take they are significant, but obviously the biggest opportunity we have during this planning period through 2022 is the successful integration of AxleTech and making sure we garner all of those costs and revenue synergies, particularly as we focus on the off-highway military opportunities there. But I would Chris to also speak about the disc braking side. Well, I think it's just overall the statement to the employee base there of how importantly are to Meritor. I think we're the perfect home for them. And what we've found in the period that we've had an investment in TransPower is those benefits are even greater than we originally estimated. And we each bring different skill sets. Obviously Meritor has over 100 year history of production for the commercial vehicle industry. And we can assist TransPower as they're moving from this low volume prototype stage to production stage. And we actually have a Head of Production that resides in San Diego and has for many months now. That's an executive of Meritor that is running the production floor. And TransPower brings to us the development expertise in this particular area and jump starts us as a full vehicle integrator. So I think overall, it's been a perfect marriage, the employees at TransPower that I meet are just thrilled to be part of Meritor. So I think it's just a natural progression. Well, to be honest, there's always elements of succession planning whenever anybody gets promoted. But I'm not saying that in any time in the foreseeable future, I see stepping away from the company. It's really twofold. Chris has really been my partner in time on the operating side. I was reading through my prepared remarks, almost everything related to the operating side of the product side. I would say Chris has either led or we've jointly led. So I think a lot of it is recognition of Chris's importance to the business. But secondarily also, as I've mentioned, the rate of the ramp-up of the electrification business has been much happened much more quickly than any of us anticipated. And those capital allocation decisions and other critical decisions around that business have really ended up flowing to my desk as you would expect, and I think it's the right time just for me to get more directly involved with that and make sure we're all aligned on those different decision points we have we encountered. Okay, thank you."

            "name": "Chris Villavarayan",
            "content": "Thanks, Jay and good morning, Alex. I think when you think about M22 and our target is $300 million of revenue. And as you look at our presentation, we talked about seven new products, and the one right in the middle is the disc brake, our single piston disc brake that we're launching. As we announced over a year-ago, we have a standard agreement on air disc brakes with Daimler. And we're looking as one customer and as we're growing here in the future, we plan to take this globally and grow the disc brakes. So the disc brake business is a considerable part of our growth strategy going forward. Thank you. Yes, excellent, Ryan. This is Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that one. So I think you hit on two points that we've been in Brazil for several years, actually over 50 years. And our current location is landlocked, and we're unable to grow from that site. And the Brazilian market, as you could imagine, and you have seen through many of our quarters is a very important market for Meritor. And so we made the decision many years ago to make a long-term commitment here and we've been working on deciding a new facility here for over 10 years. And so with the market continuing to strengthen and we've seen it strengthened over the last four to five years are our thoughts are we need a new facility, we'll add more capacity and drive local content to your point also bring us closer to our customers and also drive the best-in-class cost. It provides us yet another opportunity, have to build a new facility that's more modernized and then continues to drive our cost position. So it is one of the largest as Jay pointed out, cost reduction opportunities in our M22 plan. Thank you."

            "name": "Carl Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks Jay and good morning. On today's call I'll review our first quarter financial results and updated full-year guidance. Overall, as you heard from Jay, we delivered a solid start to 2020. We achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.64, reflecting our ability to manage the business effectively across current end market conditions. Additionally, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and in the first four months of the fiscal year, we have repurchased over 10% of outstanding shares. This reflects our continued confidence in achieving and delivering on our M2022 targets. Let's walk through the details by turning to Slide 8 where you'll see our first quarter financial results compared to the prior year. Sales were $901 million in the quarter down $137 million from a year ago driven primarily by lower global truck production and lower volumes across your other businesses. This was partially offset by revenue from AxleTech, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2019. As anticipated we saw a significant decrease in North America Class 8 production in the first quarter. Compared to the same period last year, production was down almost 17,000 units or about 20%. Additionally in Europe, production was down approximately 18,000 units or 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019 and in India, production volumes which were down almost 40% continued to be impacted by the emission standard changeover that will occur on April 1, which requires all vehicles sold after this date to comply with the new standards. This is resulting in an industry-wide focus of reducing inventory levels prior to the changeover. Additionally, we are seeing tighter credit conditions which is also contributing to the market challenges and finally revenue from AxleTech helped to offset slowing market conditions in our North America aftermarket specialty and trailer businesses. Looking at the right side of the page, we did a good job of managing cost to limit total downside earning conversion to 15% on the lower revenue. Lower volume decreased sales by $127 million or 12% from last year. On this revenue decline, adjusted EBITDA decreased $17 million or 14%. Our ability to manage cost on lower revenue was highlighted this quarter as we were able to drive lower material, labor and operating [ph] expense which resulted in very solid downside conversion performance. In addition foreign exchange was a slight headwind on sales as the US dollar had strengthen year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was unfavorably impacted by $4 million compared to the prior year. Overall, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $98 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9%. Looking at the left-hand side of the chart, gross margin came in at 14.1% this quarter an increase of 50 basis points from a year ago. This improvement was mainly driven by lower overall material costs including reduced layered capacity cost. You also recall, we announced a restructuring plan at the end of fiscal year last September. The plan was implemented in anticipation of the slowing market conditions we are now experiencing. As a result we did recognize $5 million related to the restructuring in the first quarter. As we move down the table on the left, you'll see that we're reporting $39 million of GAAP net income from continuing operations. In addition to lower sales compared to last year in fiscal 2019 we recognized a $31 million gain from the remeasurement of the Maremont asbestos liability, which did not repeat. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $52 million resulting in $0.64 per adjusted diluted share. And finally free cash was negative $35 million this quarter compared to negative $12 million in the same period last year. As you may recall, we typically use cash in the first quarter due to fewer selling days as a result of the holiday season which generally drives lower revenues and incentive compensation payments for achieve performance in 2019. Let's move to Slide 9, which details our first quarter sales and adjusted EBITDA for our reporting segments. In our commercial truck segment, sales decreased by 20% to $622 million. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by lower truck production across most regions in the segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $56 million, down $21 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for commercial truck came in at 9% down from 9.9% in the prior year. The decrease in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily by lower volumes, partially offset by lower freight and material cost, including reduced net steel and layer capacity cost. Lower labor and burden cost also contributed to managing to 13% downside conversion on the lower revenue in the segment. In our aftermarket industrial and trailer segment, sales were $370 million up $14 million or 5% from last year. The increase in sales was primarily driven by revenue from AxleTech, partially offset by decreased volumes across the segment. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $40 million which was flat compared to last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 60 basis points to 12.6%. The decrease was driven primarily by the impact from AxleTech as the expected benefit from synergies continues to ramp up to full run rate. Next I'll review our updated fiscal year 2020 global market outlook on Slide 10. We are revising production levels for India to between 265,000 to 285,000 units down over 15% from our prior outlook. Based on the market uncertainty we're seeing in this region, it is likely that the production levels after April 1 may not fully compensate for the lower production levels we are seeing now. In Europe, we're lowering our production outlook by 5,000 reflecting slightly lower truck demand and finally we are revising our outlook for the US trailer market to approximately 230,000 units to 240,000 units as we are now forecasting the trailer market to decrease more in line with Class 8 truck production. On the next slide, we provide a summary of our 2020 guidance based on these updated market assumptions. We now expect revenue to be approximately $3.7 million which is at the lower end of our previously provided guidance. We're also revising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin to 11%. We expect to manage our downside revenue conversion at the low-end of our expected range through our laser focus on managing cost. As a result of the slightly lower expectations, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be approximately $2.75 which is consistent with the low-end of our previous guidance. And finally, we now expect to generate free cash flow of $165 million this year. While we cannot control the global markets, we are pleased with our team's ability to quickly adjust to market changes and delivered solid financial results as we begin our M2022 plan. Now we'll take your questions. James, it's Carl. I think that's right. I think if you look at the guidance, the markets we did take down are what your referenced. We're still seeing North America come in relatively consistent with what we thought previously and it's really just the capabilities and ability for us to manage the cost structure to be at that lower end of our downside conversion levels of that -- around that 15% and that's what we're really managing the company to. Yes, James, it's Carl. If you look at the AxleTech revenue, we had about $43 million of revenue from AxleTech. I think what we're seeing, as it relates to the synergies expectations we're actually kind of above our internal planning from an expectation what we -- that we're delivering on. I think the business itself, we're seeing some general softness just like you're seeing whether it's in the Highway, defense and aftermarket kind of areas of the business which is similar to what we're seeing with the rest of Meritor's business. But I would say overall, we continue to be very pleased with the strategy and with the acquisition of the company. I think revenue is a little bit softer than what we're originally planning, if we had the discussion six months ago, but overall, what we're very pleased with is really just the team's ability to execute on the synergy plan and where we stand at this point. Okay, good question, Alex. The short answer is both. So, that's the beauty of the investment in TransPower is we truly felt that two plus two equals three or four in the Meritor products and the customer relationships we brought could be added with TransPower's capabilities on in that they're able to provide them the full integration for an electric vehicle. So we will be working now with our wholly owned subsidiary of TransPower on providing fully integrated electric vehicles for PACCAR. And they will be composed also where we can have have Meritor components including eAxles on some of the vehicles. No, I think as we've spoken before we couldn't agree with you more, that's fine. We've taken what we've labeled an open architecture model towards our work primarily out of TransPower, where we work very closely with our OE's development teams and work with them on what capabilities they will eventually want to in-source. And as we've mentioned specifically, as an example, we're looking forward to them in sourcing the battery sourcing and battery management systems. We're doing that right now. But we expect that they will integrate that over time because they have actually greater scale for purchasing of those. But offsetting that decline in revenue on that end will be two different items on the other side, coming up which is one are eAxles which were developing and getting to full run rate production will begin to be placed on more vehicles with significantly more content than a traditional axle. And then secondarily, there will be a segment of the market that won't have the scale that will be able to execute all the integration services. So we will be providing those as our technology is proven. Yes, Brian it's Carl, I think you're right on the gross margin, what we did see is we did see some benefit from steel in the quarter, kind of similar in line what we talked about back in November as far as outlook for the full-year. So I would say steel was probably a mid single digit million tailwind for us in the quarter. We also had a pretty significant improvement in cost as it relates to labor and burden in the quarter as well as really managing kind of our freight expenses well. So it's really, it was a combination of all of those items which were all around kind of the same type of magnitude for the quarter in which we saw which helped really drive the improvement in gross margin for us. Well, right now in terms of the market, I think we're in line with where we see, let's call it the external rating agencies coming in ACT and FTR between 240 to 250. And then on top of that, as I look at the line rates that we're seeing from our customers, I believe all those three are actually boxing in very closely. So we're quite comfortable with what we see going forward. Maybe your question on with respect to new trucks and where we see that going in the future, I think trucks are becoming far more efficient as we see. And obviously, we've seen over the last two years and with the path of electrification diesels got to get even more efficient. So I think that's one place where we've really play strongly. And so I think it's equally important because if you think about our high efficiency axles that we've launched recently as well as you know, the axles that we have coming, Jay talked about the new vocational axle, we really believe that the efficiency gain will drive it and I just want to clarify one point also on the forecast, it's 245,000 to 255,000. Very good question, Brian. I mean, that's why the TransPower investment and now the acquisition of the remaining equity was so critical, TransPower provides supervisory controls to the software in that area, that makes the whole system run including instrumentation on the vehicle, breaking all the other supervisory controls. They also provide the battery management controls that determine the energy rate of energy flow and the utilization of energy. So we do have software and software engineers at TransPower. In addition, we've ramped up within Meritor, our software engineering capability just to manage the features in the eAxle because that eAxle obviously containing motor components, cooling components requires a lot of software system intellectual properties. So we have an entire software team here in our Troy research center that's focused on the software on the eAxle as well. Yes, we welcome any of our investors or analysts to come visit TransPower in San Diego and you can ride on the test vehicles with me and see how they operate. We have thousands and thousands of test miles on these vehicles right now. Yes, continuously. Sorry for misunderstanding your question. But yes, it's true. Correct, although I think as we heard in a previous question, it is our expectation with the large OEs that they will start to take control of management of some of that data as well. And we're very open and working with them to enable them to do that. Thank you, Brian. Good morning, Ryan. It's Carl, I think you're absolutely right, we have $100 million left to go which the board has authorized us. And we've been in the first four months pretty aggressive in the share repurchases. We did signal last quarter that we have an opportunity in front of us over the next couple of years is related to what we're generating in free cash flow to repurchase up to potentially another 400 million of shares. And so I think our approach will be we'd like to fully execute and complete the existing program. But I would believe that once we do that, we'll be in a position to seek further authorization, especially where the stock is currently trading. Yes, I think Ryan as we look at the quarter specifically, electrification really was roughly flat on a year-over-year basis at least in the first quarter, we do expect that to continue to ramp-up for the rest of this fiscal year. And I think what we were talking about, probably up about $10 million or so from a year-ago. So overall as it relates about that line item itself, when you kind of do the math is about 13% downside conversion with all the components but as we go forward, we do see this pickup and ramp up in electrification spend especially with the success we've had with the new PACCAR win as well as with the TransPower acquisition. Yes, I think, Joe what we are seeing, we definitely see a margin increase in kind of from the current run rate that we finished the first quarter in. The one thing to take into account is just the overall just general softness we're seeing across the segment, obviously, we talked trailers, but also with the industrial and off-highway parts of the business and aftermarket itself that we're seeing here in North America. We're just seeing some general softness, but our expectations, as you know, we don't give a number specifically for the year by this segment, but we definitely see that margin increasing progressing throughout the year. Yes. Thanks Joe."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Todd Chirillo, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTodd Chirillo: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021 earnings call. On the call today, we have Chris Villavarayan, CEO and President; and Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Now I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Villavarayan: Good morning. Thank you for joining the call today to discuss Meritor's fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Once again, we delivered solid financial performance. We achieved our full year outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin and exceeded adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.23, while simultaneously expanding our reach into electrification. We accomplished this during significant supply chain disruption and labor issues in the United States. I want to thank the Meritor team and supply partners for working closely with our customers to optimize production and delivery. As shown on Slide 3, we had good conversion on higher revenue as global demand snapped back. Extraordinarily high input costs obviously impacted our margin for the quarter and the year, but all things considered, we're extremely pleased with the result. Let's turn to Slide 4. While the circumstances were demanding, we remained intently focused on safety, quality and delivery. We ended the year with strong metrics that give us a path to achieve our M2022 goals. With 50% of our facilities having zero recordable incidents in the year, I commend these teams for the work they did to maintain a safe working culture in a challenging environment. Our excellent quality for the year resulted in customer PPM of 23. Four of our facilities and three of our joint venture operations received the Daimler Masters of Quality Award, which recognizes outstanding suppliers with scores for quality, delivery, technology and cost performance. We're proud to say that including this year, we have earned 55 Masters of Quality Awards from Daimler over the years. We believe this level of quality differentiates us in the industry, as does our delivery rate of 96% this year. While not as high as a typical year where we consistently run 99%, we view this as an accomplishment considering the prolonged supply and labor disruption the industry is experiencing. As the commercial vehicle industry advances towards electric vehicles, we view every prototype agreement, collaboration and partnership as an important opportunity. Each one is a validation of our technology solution that could lead to a production contract as customers finalize their market strategies and architecture choices. Every quarter this year, we announced new agreements to expand our customer base and for electrification. This quarter is no exception. Please turn to Slide 5. First, Axos is electric mobility company that designs and manufactures medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks that travel on last mile back-to-base routes of less than 200 miles per day. Under a prototype agreement, Axos will evaluate and test Meritor's ePowertrain with the intention of taking it to production in future platforms. We also have a new collaboration with Electra commercial vehicles. Meritor will work with Electra to bring electrified commercial vehicles to Europe city centers, integrating Meritor's electric powertrain into an IVECO-based road sweeper application will allow Electra to replace its remote drive conversion solution and test a more efficient and compact electric powertrain. With Meritor's technical architecture, Electra can maximize the space for batteries, which will allow the vehicles to sweep more road surface in a single shift. Finally, we're proud to be a part of the U.S. Department of Energy Super Truck 3 program in collaboration with PACCAR. The goal of this program is to develop zero-emission medium-and heavy-duty trucks. Let's go to Slide 6 for a look at the significant number of diverse electrification agreements we have announced in fiscal 2021. From production awards to prototypes, medium duty to heavy, we're growing through new and existing customer relationships. In 2020, we announced the PACCAR and Volkswagen electrification production program. This fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2020, we've more than tripled the value of new EV wins and further diversified our customer base. We're also growing our opportunities in the medium-duty application space. Here, we historically have not had a large share. We have now booked electrification business of almost $0.5 billion. On Slide 7, we wanted to recap the important activity in our core business during the year. We extended contracts with Navistar and IVECO and secured new business with industrial and truck customers in India and the United States. We're on track to exceed our M2022 new business win target by approximately $100 million. Keep in mind, we expect the sustained growth of our core business to fund the growth of our electrification business as the customer base and product portfolio continues to grow. I will now turn it over to Carl for the financial details.\nCarl Anderson: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results and provide an outlook for fiscal year 2022. Despite significant headwinds in the supply chain and operating environment, we delivered solid financial performance in our fiscal year. We converted on incremental revenue at 18%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 180 basis points to 10.7%, increased adjusted earnings per share by 176% to $2.68 and generated $107 million of free cash flow. Now let's turn to Slide 8. First, I will review our segment results for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in Commercial Truck were $740 million, up over 30% year-over-year. The increase in sales was driven by higher global truck production in all markets. A year ago at this time, we were just starting to recover from pandemic-related shutdowns. Segment adjusted EBITDA for Commercial Truck was $54 million, up $30 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 7.3%, an increase of 300 basis points from a year ago. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and margin was driven primarily by conversion on the higher revenue. This was partially offset by higher freight and steel costs. Aftermarket & Industrial sales were $250 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. The majority of this was driven by higher order activity in our North America aftermarket business. Segment adjusted EBITDA was flat year-over-year. However, margins were impacted by higher freight costs, resulting in a 140 basis point decrease. For the full year, sales rose to over $3.8 billion, up 26% from last year due to strong global demand and higher truck production in all of our markets. Production in India more than doubled. South America was up 50%, and Class 8 production in North America increased by 20%. Net income from continuing operations was $200 million compared to $244 million in the prior year. You will recall last year, we recognized more than $200 million of income, net of tax, associated with the termination of the company's distribution arrangement with WABCO. This was partially offset by the recognition of value-added tax credits in our wholly-owned Brazilian entity of $15 million net of tax during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Additionally, we recognized $10 million in net tax benefits from certain tax initiatives that were implemented in the fourth quarter of this year. Adjusted EBITDA was $411 million in fiscal year 2021, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7%, an increase of 180 basis points. The increase in adjusted EBITDA and margin year-over-year was driven primarily by conversion on higher sales, partially offset by increased freight, steel and electrification costs. In total, higher steel and freight costs were an $84 million headwind in 2021. During the year, ocean container costs nearly quadrupled, hot-rolled steel increased over 250% and scrap costs double. Had we not faced these increased costs in steel and freight, our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2021 would have been significantly higher, demonstrating how well the underlying business is performing. Additionally, we also incurred $21 million in higher electrification expense as we continue to invest for the future. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.68, an increase of $1.71 from the prior year. This does exclude the $15 million in tax credits from Brazil and the $10 million of tax initiatives I mentioned earlier. And finally, free cash flow was $107 million compared to $180 million last year. Keep in mind, our 2020 free cash flow included the $265 million benefit in cash received from the termination of the distribution arrangement we had with WABCO. In 2021, we also had an approximately $70 million increase in our working capital requirements as we secured supply for our customer needs and prepare for another increase in volumes in 2022. Now let's review our global production outlook on Slide 9. We continue to see strong demand across our global markets. However, global supply chain constraints continue to impact production for our customers and the industry which we expect to continue into next year. In North America, we expect Class 8 production to be in the range of 270,000 to 290,000 units, an increase of almost 7% at the midpoint from 2021. While order activity has begun to moderate, there have been over 320,000 Class 8 trucks ordered since January. Additionally, the backlog in September was approximately 280,000 units, which is approaching the previous all-time high set in October 2018. Overall, we expect production to be limited only by constraints in the supply chain. In Europe, our production outlook is in the range of 410,000 to 430,000 units as we continue to see stable product levels on the continent. In Brazil, we expect strong demand to continue as 2021 was the highest Class 8 truck production in this region since 2014. We expect production next year in the range of 145,000 to 155,000 units. And in India, we project a slight increase from the prior year as production in the region continues to rebound. Let's turn to Slide 10 for an update to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. We are projecting our full year sales to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. In addition to revenue growth based on the production forecast I discussed, we expect approximately $100 million in incremental sales related to new business wins as part of M2022 plan. We also continue to recoup steel costs from our pass-through recovery mechanisms, which we expect will increase revenue in the range of $100 million to $150 million compared to last year. Moving to our margin outlook. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%. Our guidance range is wider than normal due to the continued uncertainty in the overall operating environment. We continue to see significant headwinds from steel and freight and anticipate these costs to be an incremental headwind of $70 million to $110 million as compared to 2021. We are executing on recovery and pricing actions to help offset some of the cost pressures we are seeing. In total, we currently are planning for $50 million to $80 million of actions, which will be more fully realized starting in our second quarter. In addition, we expect several tailwinds in fiscal year 2022. First, we will continue to drive operational performance in the business, and we will complete our previously announced footprint consolidation initiative in the first quarter, providing a $12 million to $15 million year-over-year improvement. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2022 is approximately $3.25 to $3.75. Keep in mind, this outlook is based on our revised reporting of adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share that we changed in the second quarter of 2021, which excludes the benefit of noncash tax adjustments we had previously included when we announced the M2022 plan back in November 2018. And finally, we now expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million as working capital stabilizes and we convert on incremental sales. Overall, the team continues to remain focused on delivering superior financial performance in the final year of our M2022 plan. Now I will turn the call back over to Chris for some closing remarks.\nChris Villavarayan: As Carl stated, our guidance ranges for this fiscal year are wider than usual due to the volatility we have grown accustomed to in the past few quarters. However, we are focused on delivering excellent financial results. Slide 11 provides M2022 highlights. We're particularly excited about the growth we see and plan to achieve in our core business and advanced technology. Meritor recognizes the future is electric. Our success in 2021 and our legacy in the commercial vehicle and brake business will position us well to capitalize on the growing adoption of electric vehicles around the world. As we look at the next decade, we expect the rate of adoption to dramatically increase heading towards 2030. And as the market shifts to electric powertrains, we believe Meritor's content per vehicle will grow significantly. Please turn to Slide 12. We hope you will join us for Meritor's Virtual Strategy Day on December 7. At that time, we will dimension our growth expectations as the industry transforms to electrification and share exciting new business wins with you. Following that event, we will have a live Q&A. So please mark that on your calendars. We will now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open.\nJason Stuhldreher: Team, this is Jason Stuhldreher on for Brian. Congrats on finishing fiscal year '21. I was hoping maybe just on the outlook first. The incremental margins that the outlook seems to imply, if we kind of exclude the recoveries that you're getting and then the additional steel and freight cost, it looks to be in sort of the low 30-ish percent range, which is higher than we've seen in the past. And you kind of mentioned some one-off factors, but hoping you could sort of kind of dimensionalize what your kind of expected standalone incremental margins would be? And then what the benefits of sort of finishing the footprint consolidation and other factors for next year?\nCarl Anderson: Sure. It's Carl. I can address that question. Yes, as we look at the incrementals going into 2022, a couple of things to keep in mind. I would say kind of just on base revenue, our expectation now with all of the actions we've executed over the last several years is that we will be north of 20% conversion on that incremental revenue. In addition to the footprint consolidation of $12 million to $15 million tailwind, we also expect to drive significant continued operational performance in the business as well. So that would be an additional up to $30 million plus of operational improvement, and we are also planning for less incentive compensation expense in 2022. So that all will box you to the higher margin in an absolute sense.\nJason Stuhldreher: Understood. And then maybe just on the free cash flow conversion, I mean the numbers that you're guiding to are pretty strong for 2022 kind of -- in that 75% range, maybe even a little higher. And I guess we're going to get an update on what sort of cash you guys can generate in your next -- in the next set of planning period. But as we think about some of the restructuring cash uses kind of rolling off and maybe sort of a normalization of working capital, is it kind of fair to hope for maybe north of 75% kind of going forward?\nCarl Anderson: Yes. I think obviously, we're driving to achieve the 75% for this year in 2022. And we will obviously provide an update in a couple of weeks at our Strategy Day in a little bit more detail. But the expectation, just given the improved overall balance sheet and what we expect from working capital, I think it would be a fair assumption we should be driving that number north of 75% as we go forward.\nJason Stuhldreher: Understood. Okay. Then lots to talk about on the electrification front, but I'll save that for next month. So thanks, team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sherif El-Sabbahy with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nSherif El-Sabbahy: So I just wanted to ask about the 140 basis point impact on aftermarket and industrial. It seems like freight is having an outsized impact on that segment. Could you provide a bit more color? And then when would you expect that freight impact to maybe roll off?\nCarl Anderson: Yes, as we're seeing -- as we look at kind of just global freight index since -- just in the fourth quarter alone. So this is -- if I go back to when we last talked to you back in July and where we are now, we have seen freight costs increase 50% since that time period. So I think that continues to be a near-term short-term headwind in the business. But as we kind of go forward, there are actions that we addressed in the call, especially with the aftermarket business around pricing that we expect to go into effect in the -- our second quarter. So you should start seeing that normalize a little bit further as we get out of this first quarter.\nSherif El-Sabbahy: Understood. And then with regards to the Commercial Truck segment, has it seen a similar level? Or is there pass-throughs or something of that nature there that would be offsetting a bit more that isn't present in aftermarket?\nCarl Anderson: No, it is affecting both segments, we are seeing that. Obviously, we have pass-through mechanisms on our steel, we do not have that in freight. So that is something that we have to -- have further discussions with our customers on for pricing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nJoseph Spak: Carl, if I look at some of the factors for the margin walk in '22 and revenue conversion and operating performance. If I just sort of use sort of normal historical incremental margins on the revenue you're showing, it would seem like maybe half of that 1.4 to 2.2 is from volume and the other half would be more operational performance. And I know you sort of called out the $12 million to $15 million from actions taken, but what are some of the other areas there where you can sort of drive further operational performance in '22?\nCarl Anderson: Joe, yes, I think there a couple of other areas in addition to footprint, as I mentioned earlier, would be we are expecting lower incentive compensation. So that was a -- so call that in around that $10 million type of range year-over-year. And then additionally, our expectation is we will continue to drive significant material performance into the business on a year-over-year basis. So I think those are kind of the key drivers for us to -- for that bridge.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. I guess staying there, and you sort of just touched on this a little bit like the recovery in pricing actions. So it sounds to me like that's a mix of contractual stuff and sort of negotiation, can you just help us sort of understand the split there in terms of sort of what is more just contractual that sort of owed to you? And how much is you guys rolling up your sleeves at the table and sort of trying to get some pricing back and what the reaction to those conversations have been so far?\nChris Villavarayan: So I'll take that one. And just if you break it up, steel is mostly contractual. So we have that on average somewhere between 75% to 80% as passed through. There's obviously the lag associated with when we have that recovery. Most of the conversations are most -- are on the freight side, as Carl mentioned, that is something that is not covered. And so those negotiations, as you could imagine, are obviously difficult, but our customers understand it, especially when you think about numbers where freight has gone up 400% to 500% depending on which region and the type of freight. So we've had those -- we've started those conversations early. We've continued to have those conversations, though difficult. What I would say, Joe, is at the end of the day, our customers need us healthy. So we've been able to work with them. And as we see going into '22, those costs continue to rise. So we will have to continue to have those conversations.\nJoseph Spak: And historically, it's been easier to take pricing on the aftermarket side, right, than on the correct?\nChris Villavarayan: Yes, correct. We twice the year and we've usually...\nJoseph Spak: Yes. Okay. Last one for me. Like on the EV stuff, great to hear $500 million in wins, which is, I think, what you were already, which is what you're targeting. Is there a way to let us know the split between, let's call them, legacy truck makers and some of these newer names? And also like what's the time frame for that $500 million to be recognized over?\nChris Villavarayan: So let me take that one. We don't usually provide the granularity by customer, Joe. What we're doing is essentially taking the full basket or the full revenue that we have from all our customers and risk adjusting, and that's what you see. However, in terms of, let's call it, timing, that's something that we will provide when you call in on December 7.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel.\nMatthew Milask: This is Matt on for Bruce. Congratulations on the solid fiscal '21. With regards to the fiscal '22 outlook, could you provide some more color around the key assumptions on labor cost inflation perhaps how good you guys feel about your line of sight into how the salary, wages and benefit line might ultimately impact margins next year? And maybe as a follow-up to that, if you could comment on the hiring and staffing challenges that you're experiencing now in the market, if you have any thoughts on what the impact might be on production, labor and so forth from The Biden Administration's vaccine regulations?\nCarl Anderson: Thanks, Matt. I'll take the first question and turn it over to Chris for the second. As it relates to the inflation for the workforce that we're seeing, it is embedded in our guidance right now. I think it is definitely obviously increasing depending on where we're operating and what we're in, but I would say it's fully reflected in what our guidance is from an assumption perspective. So I'll turn it over to Chris.\nChris Villavarayan: And so on the second half, Matt, if you think about it, I would say Q4 for us was probably one of our most challenging quarters thinking about labor coming with the -- obviously, the impact of the Delta variant as well as the inability to really get a good view of the line rates because of the impacts of the semiconductor shortages. So we were seeing quite a bit of sporadic shutdowns through Q4. We do see that normalizing in Q1. So our OEs have adjusted line rates based more from the visibility they have ahead of them, and that's provided us the ability to then appropriately staff. One of the other things we have done and it's a true testament of the Meritor the employees of Meritor is we were able to respond, in many cases, by moving some of our salaried folks to respond into the plants. And as we think through some of our strategies at least stabilizing through the next quarter, those are some of the, let's call it, the elements that we continue to deploy.\nMatthew Milask: And lastly, if I could sneak one more in. Could you provide any updates on the Blue Horizon platform? Perhaps some color around the planned product portfolio, production time line, maybe the order book with existing customers or any new customer activity would be great.\nChris Villavarayan: Yes, I'd love to. So perfect. So I think Blue Horizon -- under Blue Horizon, we captured both our ePowertrain as well as, let's call it, the full system with the full system, which is where we provide the PACCAR, the battery system as well as the ePowertrain, which we're launching with PACCAR, we're all aligned to go into production at the end of this year. So we're in great shape there. And then with the which is -- 14Xe, which is the ePowertrain, we announced obviously the two prototype announcements today. So that stream continues to build, and we look forward to talking more about it on our Strategy Day on the 7.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRyan Brinkman: Given that you're mostly protected in customer agreements with regard to steel cost recoveries with the biggest consideration there, I think being mostly timing differences and the optics on margin, et cetera. I thought to ask some more questions on these non-commodity supply chain costs. A number of light vehicle suppliers this quarter have called out these costs, including ocean shipping, freight, electricity, natural gas, diesel, even labor, suggesting that they are unusual and that they would seek to at least partially recover them via commercial negotiations with their customers. I heard you guys mention ocean shipping and freight a number of times. To what extent should we think about these costs as needing to be offset more through productivity and other cost savings? Is that how you've tended to handle lower rates of inflation of these costs in the past versus to what extent do you expect to pass on higher non-commodity supply chain cost to customers? If you do intend to pass along those costs, what would that process or timing of that process look like? And does it make sense to potentially formalize into future agreements, I mean not labor, but certainly maybe ocean shipping, for example, in the way that commodities began to be formalized in the contracts in the 2000s?\nChris Villavarayan: Well, it's a great question, Ryan. I think when you think about the size and scale it isn't something that we can truly absorb when we think about the business. I mean you come to a point where it becomes detrimental over time. So for us, the -- conceptually, when you look at the other elements and you've identified them well, whether it's power and portions of labor, we certainly will be looking to pass some of these on to our customers. We've started with freight because that was the most significant discussion we've had, but we certainly have had other baskets we've started discussing with our customers. As we look at the last year and just preparing for the next year, you know that a significant portion of this needs to be moved out of the business. We started early coming into the pandemic by reacting -- by adjusting our headcount as well as looking at all nondiscretionary costs. So we've done quite a bit of, let's call it, internal work. But when it comes to a point where you have increases of 200% to 500%, we certainly will be looking to have conversations with our customers.\nRyan Brinkman: And then my last question is on the labor front. You did get a question there already, so I'll try to ask it from a bit of a different angle. In the past, mostly in the industry downturns, I think you have highlighted the relatively higher percent of your workers that are temporary or were temporary at the time with the implication being that maybe there could be more easily or cost effectively let go when not needed, which is seemingly the opposite of the situation today, right? So I'm just curious what your mix of permanent versus temporary workers looks like today. If you're thinking any differently about permanent versus temporary with the benefit of temporary maybe being as much as sort of greater in downturns than upturns. And generally, what your retention looks like at the moment, you did get the question of how labor costs might track going forward. But just how about ensuring that you have sufficient continuity of experienced employees to meet quality and productivity goals, et cetera.\nChris Villavarayan: So when it comes to -- so I'll break the question into two parts. When it comes to our full-time employees, I would say that retention has been still quite good. And it's -- part of it, Ryan, is the, let's call it, the legacy of Meritor's 110 years of Rockwell heritage. And on average, when I look through our facilities, we have employees somewhere in that 14 to 17 years that are full time. So we've been -- we've done a great job in retaining those employees, and those employees based on the brand and the fact that they've worked with the same team and the same company have provided that level of loyalty, and we've seen very little issues on the retention side there. Specific to the temp side, the temp ratio is lower than what we have had previously. And that is, as you could imagine, the same pressures that we're experiencing in -- that the industry is experiencing. So we are -- the way we've been attempting to fix that is by, obviously, bringing down our temp ratio, and that's how we've addressed that. Overall, our full time, let's call it, retention is up running north of 96%.\nRyan Brinkman: And if just sneak a couple more in on capacity, where do you stand on capacity with all these new electrification awards? I don't know how intensive they are in terms of number of employees or square footage or whatnot, but it does seem like some of these awards might be incremental to existing business. Do you have sufficient capacity to the electrification wins that you've been securing or might you need to add capacity when was the last time that you've done something like that?\nCarl Anderson: So we've actually broken up -- I'll break that into two elements. So the full powertrain where we build the PACCAR, the battery system and the axle, there, we have -- that is through our acquisition in TransPower. We have two buildings, and we're constantly looking at expanding our capacity there as we see that business growing. When it comes to our ePowertrain just the axle -- the integrated axle, here, what we are doing -- we have been able to integrate it into our manufacturing sites in North Carolina between Asheville and Forest City. So here, we feel that we have enough capacity to be able to respond to the market as we see it over the next few years.\nRyan Brinkman: And then just finally, there's so much excitement right now about last-mile delivery vans, the leverage to e-commerce, think about bright drop and some of their competitors. To what extent are Ford transit or sprinter van considered to be in the Class 5 through 7 or how positioned are you or aren't you to compete in the light commercial vehicle space? What's your interest in that portion of commercial vehicles?\nCarl Anderson: Well, that's a great question. I'd love to answer that one. So when you take out -- so when you think about it, we have historically been on the heavy side. And so we started off with the 14Xe. And so if you think about Lion highly on Autocar, PACCAR, that's been the 14Xe. But the best part about our, let's call it, [indiscernible] into electrification is the wins on the medium-duty side. And so as you guys know, historically, we have had about 15% share here, and we've been winning here. So as we think about Class 7, Class 6, this is Volta, which is Hexagon, and that's where we see significant growth. And it's just been a true testament to the product that we've brought to the market right now. So we have the 14Xe that comes to Class 7 or the bottom end -- the top end of medium duty or the bottom end of heavy. And so that's what both Volta and Hexagon are using. And beyond that, we have the 12Xe that we plan to bring to the market in '23 as well as our agreement with Electric, which helps us get us into, let's call it, the top end of Class 5, Class 6 and 7. So it's not that we decided on, let's call it, a sequential strategy. We came up with parallel strategies on the medium side, and it's great to see that we're winning.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open.\nItay Michaeli: Just two follow-up financial questions for me. First, can you just touch upon what you're assuming for R&D in fiscal 2022? And then second, going back to the recovery and pricing actions, particularly for the noncontractual freight portion, how do you go about kind of modeling that? Is there sort of a percent success rate or recovery that you're assuming, just given that there might be a bit of a, I guess, an uncertain nature in terms of how those discussions may go?\nChris Villavarayan: Sure. Yes, I think on R&D, we are currently assuming about 2% R&D as a percent of sales is kind of what's in the modeling and the forecast embedded in our guidance. And then as it relates to just those discussions, whether it's freight, steel, in some cases as well because we don't always recover 100%, I think it's just -- we do build certain assumptions in there. But I would say what's happening is the pricing continues to change, and we're still seeing that kind of run up. And so those discussions are just extremely critical for us. And so at this point, we will be driving to achieve everything from all customers as it relates to the pricing actions that we need to deliver on as we go forward. And we've had some success to date. But in this rising inflationary environment, especially on some of these costs, they continue to run. So there's more work and discussions we need to have.\nItay Michaeli: Maybe a quick follow-up, Carl. I think you mentioned working capital obviously a drag with all that's been going on in the supply chain. Are you assuming a full recovery in fiscal '22? Or will there still be some additional recoveries beyond '22 just for all the recent volatility?\nCarl Anderson: Yes. As we look at it, we -- as I mentioned, we had about a $70 million headwind in '21 compared to 2020 expectations. I don't know if we'll claw all the way back, but I would say we should definitely see a $50 million-plus improvement in working capital on a year-over-year basis.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for closing remarks.\nTodd Chirillo: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Villavarayan",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you for joining the call today to discuss Meritor's fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Once again, we delivered solid financial performance. We achieved our full year outlook for adjusted EBITDA margin and exceeded adjusted diluted EPS guidance by $0.23, while simultaneously expanding our reach into electrification. We accomplished this during significant supply chain disruption and labor issues in the United States. I want to thank the Meritor team and supply partners for working closely with our customers to optimize production and delivery. As shown on Slide 3, we had good conversion on higher revenue as global demand snapped back. Extraordinarily high input costs obviously impacted our margin for the quarter and the year, but all things considered, we're extremely pleased with the result. Let's turn to Slide 4. While the circumstances were demanding, we remained intently focused on safety, quality and delivery. We ended the year with strong metrics that give us a path to achieve our M2022 goals. With 50% of our facilities having zero recordable incidents in the year, I commend these teams for the work they did to maintain a safe working culture in a challenging environment. Our excellent quality for the year resulted in customer PPM of 23. Four of our facilities and three of our joint venture operations received the Daimler Masters of Quality Award, which recognizes outstanding suppliers with scores for quality, delivery, technology and cost performance. We're proud to say that including this year, we have earned 55 Masters of Quality Awards from Daimler over the years. We believe this level of quality differentiates us in the industry, as does our delivery rate of 96% this year. While not as high as a typical year where we consistently run 99%, we view this as an accomplishment considering the prolonged supply and labor disruption the industry is experiencing. As the commercial vehicle industry advances towards electric vehicles, we view every prototype agreement, collaboration and partnership as an important opportunity. Each one is a validation of our technology solution that could lead to a production contract as customers finalize their market strategies and architecture choices. Every quarter this year, we announced new agreements to expand our customer base and for electrification. This quarter is no exception. Please turn to Slide 5. First, Axos is electric mobility company that designs and manufactures medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks that travel on last mile back-to-base routes of less than 200 miles per day. Under a prototype agreement, Axos will evaluate and test Meritor's ePowertrain with the intention of taking it to production in future platforms. We also have a new collaboration with Electra commercial vehicles. Meritor will work with Electra to bring electrified commercial vehicles to Europe city centers, integrating Meritor's electric powertrain into an IVECO-based road sweeper application will allow Electra to replace its remote drive conversion solution and test a more efficient and compact electric powertrain. With Meritor's technical architecture, Electra can maximize the space for batteries, which will allow the vehicles to sweep more road surface in a single shift. Finally, we're proud to be a part of the U.S. Department of Energy Super Truck 3 program in collaboration with PACCAR. The goal of this program is to develop zero-emission medium-and heavy-duty trucks. Let's go to Slide 6 for a look at the significant number of diverse electrification agreements we have announced in fiscal 2021. From production awards to prototypes, medium duty to heavy, we're growing through new and existing customer relationships. In 2020, we announced the PACCAR and Volkswagen electrification production program. This fiscal year, as compared to fiscal 2020, we've more than tripled the value of new EV wins and further diversified our customer base. We're also growing our opportunities in the medium-duty application space. Here, we historically have not had a large share. We have now booked electrification business of almost $0.5 billion. On Slide 7, we wanted to recap the important activity in our core business during the year. We extended contracts with Navistar and IVECO and secured new business with industrial and truck customers in India and the United States. We're on track to exceed our M2022 new business win target by approximately $100 million. Keep in mind, we expect the sustained growth of our core business to fund the growth of our electrification business as the customer base and product portfolio continues to grow. I will now turn it over to Carl for the financial details. As Carl stated, our guidance ranges for this fiscal year are wider than usual due to the volatility we have grown accustomed to in the past few quarters. However, we are focused on delivering excellent financial results. Slide 11 provides M2022 highlights. We're particularly excited about the growth we see and plan to achieve in our core business and advanced technology. Meritor recognizes the future is electric. Our success in 2021 and our legacy in the commercial vehicle and brake business will position us well to capitalize on the growing adoption of electric vehicles around the world. As we look at the next decade, we expect the rate of adoption to dramatically increase heading towards 2030. And as the market shifts to electric powertrains, we believe Meritor's content per vehicle will grow significantly. Please turn to Slide 12. We hope you will join us for Meritor's Virtual Strategy Day on December 7. At that time, we will dimension our growth expectations as the industry transforms to electrification and share exciting new business wins with you. Following that event, we will have a live Q&A. So please mark that on your calendars. We will now take your questions. So I'll take that one. And just if you break it up, steel is mostly contractual. So we have that on average somewhere between 75% to 80% as passed through. There's obviously the lag associated with when we have that recovery. Most of the conversations are most -- are on the freight side, as Carl mentioned, that is something that is not covered. And so those negotiations, as you could imagine, are obviously difficult, but our customers understand it, especially when you think about numbers where freight has gone up 400% to 500% depending on which region and the type of freight. So we've had those -- we've started those conversations early. We've continued to have those conversations, though difficult. What I would say, Joe, is at the end of the day, our customers need us healthy. So we've been able to work with them. And as we see going into '22, those costs continue to rise. So we will have to continue to have those conversations. Yes, correct. We twice the year and we've usually... So let me take that one. We don't usually provide the granularity by customer, Joe. What we're doing is essentially taking the full basket or the full revenue that we have from all our customers and risk adjusting, and that's what you see. However, in terms of, let's call it, timing, that's something that we will provide when you call in on December 7. And so on the second half, Matt, if you think about it, I would say Q4 for us was probably one of our most challenging quarters thinking about labor coming with the -- obviously, the impact of the Delta variant as well as the inability to really get a good view of the line rates because of the impacts of the semiconductor shortages. So we were seeing quite a bit of sporadic shutdowns through Q4. We do see that normalizing in Q1. So our OEs have adjusted line rates based more from the visibility they have ahead of them, and that's provided us the ability to then appropriately staff. One of the other things we have done and it's a true testament of the Meritor the employees of Meritor is we were able to respond, in many cases, by moving some of our salaried folks to respond into the plants. And as we think through some of our strategies at least stabilizing through the next quarter, those are some of the, let's call it, the elements that we continue to deploy. Yes, I'd love to. So perfect. So I think Blue Horizon -- under Blue Horizon, we captured both our ePowertrain as well as, let's call it, the full system with the full system, which is where we provide the PACCAR, the battery system as well as the ePowertrain, which we're launching with PACCAR, we're all aligned to go into production at the end of this year. So we're in great shape there. And then with the which is -- 14Xe, which is the ePowertrain, we announced obviously the two prototype announcements today. So that stream continues to build, and we look forward to talking more about it on our Strategy Day on the 7. Well, it's a great question, Ryan.

So we've been -- we've done a great job in retaining those employees, and those employees based on the brand and the fact that they've worked with the same team and the same company have provided that level of loyalty, and we've seen very little issues on the retention side there. Specific to the temp side, the temp ratio is lower than what we have had previously. And that is, as you could imagine, the same pressures that we're experiencing in -- that the industry is experiencing. So we are -- the way we've been attempting to fix that is by, obviously, bringing down our temp ratio, and that's how we've addressed that. Overall, our full time, let's call it, retention is up running north of 96%. Sure. Yes, I think on R&D, we are currently assuming about 2% R&D as a percent of sales is kind of what's in the modeling and the forecast embedded in our guidance. And then as it relates to just those discussions, whether it's freight, steel, in some cases as well because we don't always recover 100%, I think it's just -- we do build certain assumptions in there. But I would say what's happening is the pricing continues to change, and we're still seeing that kind of run up. And so those discussions are just extremely critical for us. And so at this point, we will be driving to achieve everything from all customers as it relates to the pricing actions that we need to deliver on as we go forward. And we've had some success to date. But in this rising inflationary environment, especially on some of these costs, they continue to run. So there's more work and discussions we need to have."

            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results and provide an outlook for fiscal year 2022. Despite significant headwinds in the supply chain and operating environment, we delivered solid financial performance in our fiscal year. We converted on incremental revenue at 18%, expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 180 basis points to 10.7%, increased adjusted earnings per share by 176% to $2.68 and generated $107 million of free cash flow. Now let's turn to Slide 8. First, I will review our segment results for the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in Commercial Truck were $740 million, up over 30% year-over-year. The increase in sales was driven by higher global truck production in all markets. A year ago at this time, we were just starting to recover from pandemic-related shutdowns. Segment adjusted EBITDA for Commercial Truck was $54 million, up $30 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 7.3%, an increase of 300 basis points from a year ago. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and margin was driven primarily by conversion on the higher revenue. This was partially offset by higher freight and steel costs. Aftermarket & Industrial sales were $250 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. The majority of this was driven by higher order activity in our North America aftermarket business. Segment adjusted EBITDA was flat year-over-year. However, margins were impacted by higher freight costs, resulting in a 140 basis point decrease. For the full year, sales rose to over $3.8 billion, up 26% from last year due to strong global demand and higher truck production in all of our markets. Production in India more than doubled. South America was up 50%, and Class 8 production in North America increased by 20%. Net income from continuing operations was $200 million compared to $244 million in the prior year. You will recall last year, we recognized more than $200 million of income, net of tax, associated with the termination of the company's distribution arrangement with WABCO. This was partially offset by the recognition of value-added tax credits in our wholly-owned Brazilian entity of $15 million net of tax during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Additionally, we recognized $10 million in net tax benefits from certain tax initiatives that were implemented in the fourth quarter of this year. Adjusted EBITDA was $411 million in fiscal year 2021, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7%, an increase of 180 basis points. The increase in adjusted EBITDA and margin year-over-year was driven primarily by conversion on higher sales, partially offset by increased freight, steel and electrification costs. In total, higher steel and freight costs were an $84 million headwind in 2021. During the year, ocean container costs nearly quadrupled, hot-rolled steel increased over 250% and scrap costs double. Had we not faced these increased costs in steel and freight, our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2021 would have been significantly higher, demonstrating how well the underlying business is performing. Additionally, we also incurred $21 million in higher electrification expense as we continue to invest for the future. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.68, an increase of $1.71 from the prior year. This does exclude the $15 million in tax credits from Brazil and the $10 million of tax initiatives I mentioned earlier. And finally, free cash flow was $107 million compared to $180 million last year. Keep in mind, our 2020 free cash flow included the $265 million benefit in cash received from the termination of the distribution arrangement we had with WABCO. In 2021, we also had an approximately $70 million increase in our working capital requirements as we secured supply for our customer needs and prepare for another increase in volumes in 2022. Now let's review our global production outlook on Slide 9. We continue to see strong demand across our global markets. However, global supply chain constraints continue to impact production for our customers and the industry which we expect to continue into next year. In North America, we expect Class 8 production to be in the range of 270,000 to 290,000 units, an increase of almost 7% at the midpoint from 2021. While order activity has begun to moderate, there have been over 320,000 Class 8 trucks ordered since January. Additionally, the backlog in September was approximately 280,000 units, which is approaching the previous all-time high set in October 2018. Overall, we expect production to be limited only by constraints in the supply chain. In Europe, our production outlook is in the range of 410,000 to 430,000 units as we continue to see stable product levels on the continent. In Brazil, we expect strong demand to continue as 2021 was the highest Class 8 truck production in this region since 2014. We expect production next year in the range of 145,000 to 155,000 units. And in India, we project a slight increase from the prior year as production in the region continues to rebound. Let's turn to Slide 10 for an update to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. We are projecting our full year sales to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion. In addition to revenue growth based on the production forecast I discussed, we expect approximately $100 million in incremental sales related to new business wins as part of M2022 plan. We also continue to recoup steel costs from our pass-through recovery mechanisms, which we expect will increase revenue in the range of $100 million to $150 million compared to last year. Moving to our margin outlook. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%. Our guidance range is wider than normal due to the continued uncertainty in the overall operating environment. We continue to see significant headwinds from steel and freight and anticipate these costs to be an incremental headwind of $70 million to $110 million as compared to 2021. We are executing on recovery and pricing actions to help offset some of the cost pressures we are seeing. In total, we currently are planning for $50 million to $80 million of actions, which will be more fully realized starting in our second quarter. In addition, we expect several tailwinds in fiscal year 2022. First, we will continue to drive operational performance in the business, and we will complete our previously announced footprint consolidation initiative in the first quarter, providing a $12 million to $15 million year-over-year improvement. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2022 is approximately $3.25 to $3.75. Keep in mind, this outlook is based on our revised reporting of adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share that we changed in the second quarter of 2021, which excludes the benefit of noncash tax adjustments we had previously included when we announced the M2022 plan back in November 2018. And finally, we now expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million as working capital stabilizes and we convert on incremental sales. Overall, the team continues to remain focused on delivering superior financial performance in the final year of our M2022 plan. Now I will turn the call back over to Chris for some closing remarks. Sure. It's Carl. I can address that question. Yes, as we look at the incrementals going into 2022, a couple of things to keep in mind. I would say kind of just on base revenue, our expectation now with all of the actions we've executed over the last several years is that we will be north of 20% conversion on that incremental revenue. In addition to the footprint consolidation of $12 million to $15 million tailwind, we also expect to drive significant continued operational performance in the business as well. So that would be an additional up to $30 million plus of operational improvement, and we are also planning for less incentive compensation expense in 2022. So that all will box you to the higher margin in an absolute sense. Yes. I think obviously, we're driving to achieve the 75% for this year in 2022. And we will obviously provide an update in a couple of weeks at our Strategy Day in a little bit more detail. But the expectation, just given the improved overall balance sheet and what we expect from working capital, I think it would be a fair assumption we should be driving that number north of 75% as we go forward. Yes, as we're seeing -- as we look at kind of just global freight index since -- just in the fourth quarter alone. So this is -- if I go back to when we last talked to you back in July and where we are now, we have seen freight costs increase 50% since that time period. So I think that continues to be a near-term short-term headwind in the business. But as we kind of go forward, there are actions that we addressed in the call, especially with the aftermarket business around pricing that we expect to go into effect in the -- our second quarter. So you should start seeing that normalize a little bit further as we get out of this first quarter. No, it is affecting both segments, we are seeing that. Obviously, we have pass-through mechanisms on our steel, we do not have that in freight. So that is something that we have to -- have further discussions with our customers on for pricing. Joe, yes, I think there a couple of other areas in addition to footprint, as I mentioned earlier, would be we are expecting lower incentive compensation. So that was a -- so call that in around that $10 million type of range year-over-year. And then additionally, our expectation is we will continue to drive significant material performance into the business on a year-over-year basis. So I think those are kind of the key drivers for us to -- for that bridge. Thanks, Matt. I'll take the first question and turn it over to Chris for the second. As it relates to the inflation for the workforce that we're seeing, it is embedded in our guidance right now. I think it is definitely obviously increasing depending on where we're operating and what we're in, but I would say it's fully reflected in what our guidance is from an assumption perspective. So I'll turn it over to Chris. So we've actually broken up -- I'll break that into two elements. So the full powertrain where we build the PACCAR, the battery system and the axle, there, we have -- that is through our acquisition in TransPower. We have two buildings, and we're constantly looking at expanding our capacity there as we see that business growing. When it comes to our ePowertrain just the axle -- the integrated axle, here, what we are doing -- we have been able to integrate it into our manufacturing sites in North Carolina between Asheville and Forest City. So here, we feel that we have enough capacity to be able to respond to the market as we see it over the next few years. Well, that's a great question. I'd love to answer that one. So when you take out -- so when you think about it, we have historically been on the heavy side. And so we started off with the 14Xe. And so if you think about Lion highly on Autocar, PACCAR, that's been the 14Xe. But the best part about our, let's call it, [indiscernible] into electrification is the wins on the medium-duty side. And so as you guys know, historically, we have had about 15% share here, and we've been winning here. So as we think about Class 7, Class 6, this is Volta, which is Hexagon, and that's where we see significant growth. And it's just been a true testament to the product that we've brought to the market right now. So we have the 14Xe that comes to Class 7 or the bottom end -- the top end of medium duty or the bottom end of heavy. And so that's what both Volta and Hexagon are using. And beyond that, we have the 12Xe that we plan to bring to the market in '23 as well as our agreement with Electric, which helps us get us into, let's call it, the top end of Class 5, Class 6 and 7. So it's not that we decided on, let's call it, a sequential strategy. We came up with parallel strategies on the medium side, and it's great to see that we're winning. Yes. As we look at it, we -- as I mentioned, we had about a $70 million headwind in '21 compared to 2020 expectations. I don't know if we'll claw all the way back, but I would say we should definitely see a $50 million-plus improvement in working capital on a year-over-year basis."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jack Kienzler, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nJack Kienzler: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the Third Quarter of 2021. Participating with me today are our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Linebarger. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jen Rumsey, and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Smith. We will all be available for your questions at the end of the conference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs, and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in this slide. Deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Due during the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website at www. cummins.com, under the heading of Investors and Media. But with that out of the way, we will begin with our Chairman and CEO, Tom Linebarger.\nTom Linebarger: Thank you, Jack and good morning. Welcome everybody. I'll start with a summary of our Third Quarter financial results and our market trends by region and finish with a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Demand remains strong in the third quarter as the global economy continued to improve, driving strong sales growth across most businesses and regions outside of China. In China, industry-wide sales of trucks and construction equipment is slowed sharply, but in line with our expectations. We remain encouraged by the economic trends in our markets, which point to strong end-user demand extending into 2022. We also continue to see orders for our products outpaced our competition as a result of their strong performance in the field. Unfortunately, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact our ability to produce and ship products, driving up costs and limiting sales growth in the short run. These supply chain constraints are impacting our OEM customers in much the same way. Before getting further into our results, I want to take a moment to highlight a couple of strategic milestones in the evolution of our next-generation products and technologies. In October, we announced that we will bring a 15-liter natural gas engine for heavy-duty trucks to the North American market. This engine was launched earlier this year in China and has been well-received in the market, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability this far. The 15-liter natural gas engine is an important part of our path to zero emission strategy, by offering a significant reduction in both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases in a product that's available today and utilizes existing infrastructure. Equally exciting is that this engine is designed to accept a range of gases and renewable fuels, including hydrogen in the future. In fact, all of Cummins' engine platforms are being designed with the same fuel flexibility. At the same time, we are working with Chevron and others in the energy industry to increase the availability of renewable natural gas and other renewable fuels to ensure infrastructure is in place to meet our customers needs. We also signed a letter of intent to establish a joint venture between Rush Enterprises and Cummins, which will produce Cummins branded natural gas fuel delivery systems for the commercial vehicle market in North America, combining the strengths of momentum fuel technology's compressed natural gas fuel delivery systems and Cummins powertrain expertise along with the engineering and support infrastructure of both companies. These are important steps in expanding our portfolio of Power Solutions options to help customers meet their business goals and operation objectives, while also meeting increasingly stringent emission standards and achieving our customers sustainability goals. Now, I will comment on the overall Company performance for the third quarter of 2021 and cover some of our key markets. Revenues for the third quarter of 2021 were $6 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA was $862 million or 14.4% compared to $876 million or 17.1% a year ago. Higher freight and logistics expenses, rising material costs and other manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the ongoing supply chain challenges in our industry. More than offset the benefits of global volume in increases compared to the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, EBITDA in the third quarter of last year was helped by temporary salary reductions, which lowered our cost by approximately $90 million. Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 13% to $3.4 billion, driven by higher engine and component shipments across the heavy and medium-duty on highway markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 55,000 units, increase of 10% from 2020 levels. Cummins sold 22,000 heavy-duty engines in the same period, up 30% from 2020 levels. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 26,000 units in the third quarter, a decrease of 5% from 2020 levels, while our Cummins unit sales were 23,000, an increase of 25% in 2020. We shipped 43,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the third quarter of this year, a decrease of 2% from 2020 levels, but still a very strong quarter. Revenues for power generation grew by 2% due to higher demand in recreational vehicle, standby power, and datacenter markets. Our international revenues increased by 22% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 11% due to lower demand in the medium and heavy-duty truck markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 217,000 units, a decrease of 53% as the industry works through the national standard 5 truck inventory on hand and lower demand for newer higher-cost national standard 6 unit. Our unit sales in units, including joint ventures, were 40,000, a decrease of 49% versus the third quarter last year. Our light-duty engine sales were 33,000, a decrease of 40% driven by supply chain constraints and weaker market demand. Industry demand for excavators in China in the third quarter were 56,000 units, a decrease of 15% from 2020 levels. Our units in Cummins sold were 88,600 units, a decrease of 20%. Power generation sales in China increased 52% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, based on strong demand in data centers and other backup power applications. We continue to hold a market-leading position in the data center segment in China, driven by strong end-user relationships and our compelling product offerings.  Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $520 million, an increase of 76% from the third quarter of 2020. Industry truck production increased by a 120%, while our shipments increased 135% as our joint venture partner continued to gain share. Demand for power generation and construction equipment also rebounded strongly in the third quarter compared to a very low base a year ago. In our Power Systems market, industrial engine revenue increased 33% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year driven by mining in oil and gas. In Brazil, our revenues increased 26% driven by increased demand across all end markets. Now let me quickly cover our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect our revenue to be at the lower end of our guidance are up approximately 20% versus 2020. EBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15%, below our previous guidance of 15.5% to 16% of sales. Our expected EBITDA margins are lower because of the persistence of the supply chain constraints and disruptions, which are now exacerbated by escalating material and freight prices. We've lowered our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 228,000 units, up 25% compared to 2020, but below our prior guidance of 264,000 units. This is again due to the supply chain constraints impacting our customers rather than a lack of end-user demand. In the medium-duty trucks market, we are decreasing our forecast for industry production to a 118,000 units, up 15% year-over-year, but below our prior guidance of 134,000 units. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be up 25% compared to 2020, an increase of 7.5% from our expectations three months ago. In China, we continue to expect domestic on-highway demand to decline from record levels a year ago. Our 2021 outlook for medium and heavy-duty truck market demand is 1.65 million units, and our 2021 outlook for light-duty trucks market is 2 million units; both unchanged from our previous guidance. We continue to expect industry sales of excavators to be flat with the record levels achieved in 2020 and unchanged from our previous guidance. In India, we anticipate industry demand for trucks to be up 75%,compared to levels experienced in 2020. And our other businesses are showing promising growth due to continued infrastructure investment, this is also unchanged from previous guidance. We now expect demand for mining engines, to increase 60% in 2021. Up from our expectation of 45% 3 months ago based on continued strength in commodity prices. We continue to expect global power generation revenue to increase 15%, primarily driven by the data-center and recreational vehicle markets. Summing up the quarter, strong demand across many of our markets drove continued sales growth in the third quarter. Despite the strong demand, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact both our operations and those of our customers, resulting in higher material and logistics costs, as well as capping revenue growth. We are working collaboratively with our customers and suppliers to navigate these challenges and position the Company for better performance in 2022. Customers are recognizing the strong performance of our products, resulting in our sales growing faster than industry demand in a number of important markets. We continue to invest in bringing new technology to our customers, outgrowing our end markets, and providing strong cash returns to our shareholders. The Company expects to return over 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2021 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Thank you for your time today and now let me turn it over to Mark.\nMark Smith: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. There are four key takeaways from our third quarter results. End customer demand remains strong in the third quarter, driving sales growth -- strong sales growth across most end markets and businesses outside of China, where truck and construction demand has weakened in line with our expectations. Global supply chains remain constrained, impacting our industry's ability to meet strong customer demand, and resulting in higher freight, labor, and logistics expenses and rising material costs. As a result of the continued supply challenges and associated costs, we are lowering our full-year sales and profitability outlook even though underlying demand remains very strong. Finally, we'll return $345 million to shareholders through cash dividends, and share repurchases in the quarter, and a total of $1.83 billion for the first 9 months of the year consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year. Now let me go into more details on the third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, an increase of 17% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 13% and international revenues rose 22%. EBITDA was $862 million dollars or 14.4% of sales for the quarter, compared to $876 million or 17.1% of sales a year ago. As a reminder, EBITDA in Q3 last year would lose by $90 million of temporary salary reductions, and the $44 million VAT recovery in Brazil. Along with the strong demand, the key feature of our performance in Q3 was that our gross margin continues to be challenged by the supply chain constraints and elevated costs. gross margin of $1.4 billion or 23.7% of sales increased by $65 million but declined as a percent of sales by 270 basis points. Global supply chain constraints continue to impact the industry's ability to meet elevated and the cost demand and have resulted in higher costs. We incurred approximately $90 million of additional freight, labor and logistics costs in the third quarter. in addition to rising material costs, partially offset by increased pricing in the aftermarket. SG&A expenses increased by $38 million or 7%, and research expenses increased by $42 million or 19% from a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation expenses. As a reminder, due to the significant uncertainty the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented temporary salary reductions in April 2020, through the end of September last year. These salary reductions resulted in approximately $90 million of pre -tax savings for the Company last year and impacted gross margin and our operating expenses and impacted the comparisons of the results of all of our operating segments. Joint venture income was $94 million in the third quarter, down slightly from $98 million a year ago due primarily to weaker demand for both trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income of $32 million increased by $11 million year-over-year. Net earnings for the quarter were $534 million or $3.69 per diluted share compared to $501 million or $3.36 per share from a year ago, primarily due to a lower tax rate and a reduced share count. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.9%. Our income tax expense included favorable discrete items of $11 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $569 million dollars compared to $1.2 billion dollars a year ago. An increase in working capital led to the lower operating cash flow for this quarter. Now, let me comment on segment performance and our latest guidance for the full-year 2021. For the engine segment, third quarter revenues increased 22% from a year ago, driven by increased demand for trucks in the U.S. and construction equipment in the U.S. and Europe. EBITDA decreased from 18.1% to 15.2%, primarily driven by higher supply chain costs, lower joint venture income, and higher compensation expense, partially offset by the benefits of stronger volumes and lower warranty expense. But the full year, we've reduced our revenue guidance to be 24% at the midpoint, down 1% for the full year. We now expect EBITDA margins to be between 14.2% and 14.7% a little below our prior year guidance of 14.5% to 15% primarily due to the weaker sales on ongoing supply chain challenges. In the distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago. EBITDA increased in dollars but decreased as a percent of sales from 10.6% to 9.8% primarily due to some of the supply chain challenges but again the higher compensation costs. We have maintained our 2021 outlook for distribution segment revenues to be up 8% and increased EBITDA margins to 9.3% of sales at the midpoint of our guidance. Component segment, revenues increased 16% in the third quarter, driven primarily by stronger demand for trucks in North America. EBITDA decreased from 16.9% to 14.1% primarily due to higher supply chain costs and higher warranty expenses compared to very, very low cost of quality in the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we now expect components revenue to increase 28%, lower than our prior guidance of up 32%, primarily driven by a weaker outlook in North America and slightly lower outlook for China truck. We have also lowered our forecast EBITDA margins for the segment to be at 15.5% of sales at the midpoint, down from our prior guidance of 17%, as this segment is being more hardly -- has been hit harder by the supply chain challenges and the slowdown in truck production in North America and China. In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 19% in the third quarter, driven by stronger demand for power generation and mining equipment. EBITDA increased by $33 million, and expanded by 10.3 to 11.5% of sales, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and lower product coverage expense. Partially offset by elevated supply chain costs. For the full year we're increasing our power systems revenue guidance to be up 22% from our prior guide of 18% growth driven primarily by a stronger outlook in the mining segment. We're also increasing our EBITDA margin forecast to be 11.5% of sales at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 11.25. In the new power segment, revenue increased $23 million, up 28% due to stronger sales of battery electric system. EBITDA losses for the quarter were $58 million as we continue to invest in new products and scale up ahead of widespread adoption of the new technologies that we're developing. For the full year, we now project new power revenues of $120 million at the midpoint, and EBITDA losses to be in the range of $200 million. We expect total Company revenues now to grow approximately 20% at the low-end of our prior guidance. We're also lowering our EBITDA margin guidance to be approximately 15% for the full year, down from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16%. A slower pace of improvement in North American truck production and continued elevated costs associated with the global supply chain challenges were the primary drivers of the lower outlook. We expect joint venture earnings to be up 10% for this year in line with our prior [Indiscernible]. We're forecasting our full-year effective tax rate to be 21.5%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures were a $150 million in the quarter, up from a $116 million a year ago, when we continue to expect full-year capital spend of between $725-$775 million. To summarize, we faced incredibly strong demand in many of our core markets but continue to face global supply chain challenges which have impacted our cost base, and more so than we'd expected in the second half of the year. However, this end customer demand remains strong, outpacing supply in many important markets and setting us up for a strong 2022, assuming the global economy remains strong. I want to thank all of our employees for their tireless work this year to ensure that we've meet the needs of our customers while continuing to deliver solid financial results. We continue to prioritize improving our performance cycle-over-cycle, investing in technologies that will power profitable growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. Thank you for your interest today. And now let me turn it back over to Jack.\nJack Kienzler: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. And if you have any additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are now ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a question, [Operator Instructions]. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. Again, [Operator Instructions]. And as just previously stated, please make sure you're limiting yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our next question is come -- sorry, our first question is coming from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephen Volkmann: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe I'll just dive in on some of these supply chain issues. Is it possible to just bucket the impact that you guys have seen? I'm thinking about price costs being a headwind, I'm thinking about logistics costs I think you gave us a number for that Mark. I'm guessing there's probably some productivity headwinds. I'm just trying to see if we can better understand exactly what you're seeing relative to these supplier interruptions.\nMark Smith: Happy to do that and good morning, Steve. So yes, we are almost 2% worse between the price we've recovered in -- well, not recovered. The price increases that we've made principally in the aftermarket this year, which has added about 70 basis points to our results. And we've lost yeah, more than 2.5 points between the premium freight, rising material costs, and inefficiencies in our operations. And that's a little bit -- that's higher obviously than when anticipated 3 months ago. We did see a reduction in premium freight from the second quarter to the third quarter, but we started to see more increase on the material cost side.\nStephen Volkmann: And Mark, is it too early? I mean, I'm assuming for 2022 year goal will be to get right with that. Or maybe even a little bit better. I don't know, any commentary you can make as we go out into '22?\nMark Smith: I will just say this continues to be a high area of focus both on our operation side and also working through this with suppliers and customers and implementing price increases.\nTom Linebarger: Hey Steve, this is Tom, the one thing that everybody is still worried about in our industry is semiconductors. It's not that things haven't improved some because they have, but it's marginal improvement. It's still a really tight supply chain, so there's a lot of issues across the supply chain, labor shortages, freight, etc. But semiconductors look like they're -- they have a longer-term capacity issue and I'd also say the freight side of things just seems like it's not quite getting better yet when you look at where containers are and what ports look like. So there's no question that, as Mark said, internally, we are working as much as we can to address our cost side inefficiencies. He talked about going out and negotiating price increases, and as you know on the material cost side, those come automatically, but we'll have to negotiate for the rest. It's just that some of these things look like they are likely to be somewhat persistent. That doesn't mean we're not hoping to improve them all. I just want to be realistic about those. There'll be some element that looks like it goes into next year too.\nStephen Volkmann: Understood. Thank you, I guess high freight costs are probably good long-term for you guys, but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. Thanks.\nOperator: Yeah.\nMark Smith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. I guess Tom, I just wanted to get more color from you on how you're thinking about China as we head into 2022, that's an important market for you. And what, in terms of like the power shortages and outages over there, how that's impacting your business goals from a negative perspective and potentially a positive perspective over time. I -- so I guess I'll start there.\nTom Linebarger: Yeah. Let me let Jen talk a little bit about how the China market is now and how we're seeing it, and I can jump back in and see us talk about sort of longer-term things.\nJamie Cook: Okay.\nJennifer Rumsey: Hi, Jamie. As you heard from Mark, and we've been forecasting, we've seen a drop-off at the middle of the year in the China market -- on-highway market in particular, with the changeover between NS V and NS VI emission standards. So we saw inventory building up in the first half of the year and we're now seeing that coming down and getting sold in regions that are still allowing NS V product sales. And so that combined with a higher cost of the new emissions product has, as we expected, driven a drop in on-highway demand, which we expect to come back to some degree. 2020 was a record year for China though, so our expectation is that market's going to come back to be more in line with what we saw in '19 for on-highway. We are benefiting in China from additional content in the components business with new emissions requirements and also the launch of the endurance transmission now in China. So we see that benefit and we think our NS-VI products are going to performed well in the market as well and give us some upside potential. But the market overall is down. The construction market has also come down some and we are continuing to see some strength in the power gen market there. We are watching the impact of those power shortage issues in China very closely with our suppliers, it's not created a major disruption for us to this point, but it is something we continue to watch closely.\nTom Linebarger: Yeah. I would just pick up from where Jen left off, the power shortages as she said. Some impacts on production, but not a huge cost impact. But as you suggested, Jamie, we do think it helps us in the market. And as I mentioned in my remarks, our power-gen business is positioned well in China and now I look at China and I see us positioned across all of our markets. The truck side, as Jen said, we've now got -- our automatic transmissions are taking off, our content across the engines is growing. There's more consolidation in the market. So as things start to come back, I think we're better positioned we've ever been. Add to it, that we're now doing electrolyzers with a partner in China. We've got fuel-cell launches in China. So on the new power side, while things are moving slower in China than maybe and people anticipated several years ago, that's just allowed us to position ourselves to be in those markets more strongly as they take off. So again, today -- looking where I am today, I'd say our position in China has really never been stronger. So, yeah. Do I wish the market was stronger this year? Sure. But I think as it turns back down, we're able to consolidate more and strengthen our position.\nJennifer Rumsey: And we have the new N15 natural gas product launched in China as well now, and that I think positions us better for what's a fairly sizable natural gas market in China as well.\nJamie Cook: Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, can you just talk to how far your order book extent today and to what degree there's risks that the order book has unfavorable pricing in it, and are you concerned about double ordering at all? Thanks.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah. I mean, at this point, the demand out there is very strong. We're seeing growing back orders in some of our businesses. And I've been out in recent couple of months talking with both OEMS and customers and there is strong demand out there that for sure is real at this point, customers are not getting all the trucks that they would like to get this year and do not believe even looking into next year, they think that there's going to be some limitations. I think that orders are strong and as Tom said, we've got some contractual pricing on metals that we'll get, as we go into next year. We've been taking pricing actions where we go direct to the market and aftermarket on PowerGen, and we're continuing to work with our OEM customers, on first-fit to negotiate pricing just in light of that cost environment we see right now.\nJamie Cook: Thank you very much.\nTom Linebarger: Thanks Jamie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ann Duignan of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAnn Duignan: Hi. Good morning. Thank you, Just to follow up on the supply chain, a quick follow-up, please. Would you expect, the announcement that we're eliminating the European tariffs on steel and aluminum to have any impact on U.S. steel prices in 2022?\nTom Linebarger: Hi Ann I'm Tom, it's good to hear you. I really don't know because again, there are, as you know, export, I mean, sorry, import caps on that too. So how much that's going to really impact prices is unclear to me. And demand, of course, for metals is pretty high now. So the markets are pretty well-supported. In fact, our mining, you saw our mining numbers are up and that's primarily driven by metal prices. So just in the U.S., it feels to me like it's going to have moderate long-term impact. Short-term, it may provide a little bit of relief, but I would have said that given the import caps, it's probably not a big move medium or long term.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color on that and my real question though is more fundamental. I mean, you're talking about the 15-liter engine being able to use fuels like hydrogen as their major fuel. If it's so easy to convert a 15-liter internal combustion engine to burning hydrogen, why are we investing in fuel-cells at all? If we can do it with just a new fuel injection system or some minor re-engineering of an internal combustion engine, why go down the path of the hydrogen investments or in particular fuel cells at all?\nTom Linebarger: Well, as you know, the hydrogen investments would be the same. Still we would need to generate hydrogen and, of course, we need green hydrogen in order to actually reduce the CO2 impact of the fuel. And really, hydrogen combustion is a good answer. It's just not as efficient as a fuel cell. So if you're running our long-haul heavy-duty trucks where fuel is your number one cost or power energy is, then that efficiency increase from a fuel cell is going to be worth it to you. If you have a relatively short range or you have a vocational truck, our view is maybe a hydrogen engine might work for you, especially if the conversion to fuel cell is too expensive and you're not having that many units. So our view is there's a place for both, but if you want to think what's going to really drive the transportation economy 20 years -- 15 years from now, you're going to need the efficiency that a fuel cell, especially with an electric system, is going to provide. So our feeling still as fuel sales win, for the majority of the trucking industry, but we -- hydrogen engines are a real addition to the portfolio of products that are -- can be available across our markets.\nJennifer Rumsey: And there's a time factor too, as you can imagine. As fuel cells advanced and costs come down, and maybe there are period of time where hydrogen engines are having an economic advantage, but as Tom said over time costs come down, that efficiency benefit for customers that are really driven strictly by total costs on ownership. May -- we think will drive a shift toward fuel cell and applications like Line Haul.\nAnn Duignan: Okay, I'll take mine more engineering relented questions offline and then\nJennifer Rumsey: You have a lot of them. I'm going to be Jamie to be\nTom Linebarger: Ann [Indiscernible]\nJennifer Rumsey: Ann, I'm going to be happy to have a longer conversation --\nAnn Duignan: I'm over-simplifying just simple fuel injection system re-engineering.\nJennifer Rumsey: Exactly, I think taken 30 Second on it, we're designing this platform that the physical hardware for flexibility is exactly as you said, this fuel system and some other components differences and then the tuning. Of course, the calibration and control of the engine is different based on the fuel, but we're able to leverage some of that manufacturing and engineering investment in a common platform.\nAnn Duignan: Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue. Appreciate that.\nTom Linebarger: Thank you, Ann.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Tse of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nTim Tse: Thank you. Good morning. The question really is just hoping you could give some help in terms of how we should think about the relationship between heavy and medium-duty engine sales for Cummins versus Industry truck production, both in the fourth quarter and then as we get into '22. I'm just thinking about how you out pacing the industry as your OEM customers deal with all these red-tag trucks. How should we think about that, again, relationship? Obviously, a global impact or maybe just thinking about the heavy-duty segment here in the near term.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, there's a couple of dynamics. So of course, we've added some additional OEM customers. So when you think about our sales through OEMS and medium-duty and heavy-duty. And you saw -- you heard some of the numbers around how much of the total market we're seeing with Cummins engine. So we feel really well-positioned, our products are performing well, there's a lot of end-user pull and we've seen good position in the market. The dynamic that is happening in the fourth quarter, in most cases, we have been able to work through the supply constraints and continue to supply to our OEM customers and have not, in most cases, been the reason they've not been able to build trucks.  So as they take down some of their build rate, stabilize their production and complete these trucks that they build short of some components. We have seen some reduction in demand on the engine itself as they're working to really stabilize and get to more efficient build rates to make sure they are building with what supply and inventory they have and level that out. So that is impacting that in the fourth quarter and in part why we adjusted our revenue guidance.\nMark Smith: What I would add Tim is what we see is our products are performing incredibly well. We see it in our financials with very positive results on cost of quality and overall strong sense of enthusiasm for the products that we're putting in the market. Invariably, you're going to get some volatility quarter-to-quarter, as we always do, but we feel really good about the position of our products in the market. I think that's the message when you step back and when we're done with this year and and we look at the message you want you to leave with, and, of course, we're optimistic about picking up more business over time.\nTim Tse: Got it. And then Mark just on the margin impact in components. Obviously, a lot of metals and platinum and palladium and etc. used there, and I know there's always a time lag. Is there a way to think about the margin impact this year that's effectively a timing gap that you get the presume the -- presuming things stabilize, which maybe is a wrong assumption, but is there a way to think about what is more of a short-term impact that gets reversed next year or is it too hard to piece that part?\nMark Smith: If I just step back because there's a lot of noise year-over-year because some of the actions we took last year, the boosted results for us to step back from the noise of the numbers. I'll come back to that in a moment. Really, we're wrestling with three issues in that business that are somewhat different than we'd anticipated 3 or 6 months ago. Number one, for the production in North America has not picked up in the second half of the year, if anything, it's drifted down a little bit. And we were counting on that in our guidance. So we think underlying demand supports are robust environment for next year, and that should take care of itself. Number 2, whilst we anticipated a sharp drop in the second half of the year in China and that's playing out largely as we've expected. This business is doing a major product transition for NS-5 to NS-6. And in variable when we start with the launch of new products, will below optimal scale, demand is still pretty light for NS-6 so as we ramp up, we'd expect margins to recover. The bigger challenge, or the more, naughty challenges the rise in supply chain costs, which is really what we've seen when in the first half of the year we saw OEMS principally, availability impacting our operations, supply chain and the engine business. We've seen that spread more to more electrical components. And what's happened is the components business has picked up more cost and efficiency. So that one's not you were working\nMark Smith: through all that. Yes, we got the metal costs, we got the normal contractual adjustments around that. But it's that focus on the supply chain and the other actions that we talked about at the start of the call that we're focused on here. But I just wanted to try and simplify the message. There's a lot of noise out there. I'll just say one other thing just -- you didn't ask me, just clear up some noise I hear. Whilst -- in the explanations, we mentioned higher product coverage costs in this segment, it's compared to an extraordinarily low number last year. There's no big charge for product coverage or warranty in the segments. I just wanted to clear that up for other listeners. Thank you.\nTim Tse: Got it. All right. Thanks for the time, Mark.\nMark Smith: Cheers, Tim. Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nTom Linebarger: Hi, Jerry.\nJennifer Rumsey: Hi, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Tom, you folks target structural improvements in the business every cycle and I'm wondering as you look at the supply chain challenges that the entire industry face here, how are you folks thinking about potential changes in the way you manage inventories or the way you manage the supply chain going forward? Is there an opportunity to reduce some of the volatility by meaningfully increasing inventories given where cost of debt is, etc.? wondering how you're thinking about positioning comments coming out of this pretty complex environment we're facing here.\nTom Linebarger: Jerry, it's a terrific question, and as you can imagine, it's been on my mind for a while. We did -- early in the pandemic we did do some structural reform. I think we talked about on some previous calls trying to say, hey, well, the market's down, let's make sure that we get our capacity rightsize and I think we did some good work early on on that. But with the supply chain challenges, we've also seen a bunch of new problems that we weren't seeing before. You highlighted some of them. Do we have enough inventory in the right places? Are we outsourced in places we should be insourced? And then of course with trade challenges between countries, are we relying too much on cross-border trade. So all those things now are in our strategy looking forward about how we want to reposition our supply chain. So today what we're doing is trying to get our costs down, trying to get our production up to meet customer demand, and trying to keep our supply chain people at work. when it's -- they're basically working 24/7. It's been really, really rough, so I would just say that the strategic elements, while we're doing a lot of work and analysis on them, there's no question that we've taken a backseat to try to keep operations going in the last couple of quarters. But those issues are first and foremost, for us and the leadership team, thinking about how we want to position. And I will just say this, broadly speaking, what we're thinking about is we do need to reposition what we outsourced and what we in-source for the future, partly because of some of the supply chain challenges we've seen here, but also because the industry is likely to consolidate further. And we need to make sure that we can be the reliable supplier that we need to be for our customers. So we will be looking at that and thinking through where the right way to position ourselves in different supply chains is, but I think you've hit on a key point that there will be some optimization that will be helpful to us, both from a cost and reliability point-of-view overtime.\nJerry Revich: Terrific. On a separate note, I'm wondering if you could talk about the outlook for your electrification opportunities in off-highway markets, obviously a pretty fragmented supplier base in terms of other engine systems in the market now. How do you see that as an opportunity set for comments and are there significant major new product milestones that we should look forward to as you folks electrify the off-highway offerings?\nTom Linebarger: As you said, off highway is more fragmented and generally speaking, conversations are a phase behind on highway in battery electric power trains, but they are common. As you'd guess, every major off highway producers trying to figure out what their long-term strategy is from carbon point of view and sustainability point of view. We are having conversations with many of them. In all cases, I think the battery electric conversation, it is at a high level strategically as the same thing. All of them need a solution. All of them want to figure out when is the costs -- the total cost of ownership for end-users work out and it generally doesn't today unless you're in a publicly financed application. If you're in a train or a bus or a ferry, okay. If you're in a commercially viable thing, it doesn't quite work out yet, but the numbers as you know are changing quickly, but it still doesn't work out. So they are trying to figure out how to position themselves for when it does work out, who they partner with, and how. And today, most of those partnership conversations are pushed out because there's not a viable offering to make today, nor is there a way to get to a viable offering within technologies and the costs as they are now. So everyone's looking forward trying to figure out what does it look like. Off-highway, I believe, strategically, will be in the same challenge that they're in today. Not enough volume to justify a special one, but very specific needs to their application. And our view is that Cummins will be well-positioned because we will have products and on-highway which will give us volume and scale and then we will have an understanding of their application and how to adapt the technologies most effectively to off-highway so that we'll represent a good partner to them, and as you guessed, that sort of the pitch I'm making to them now that we'd be the right partner for them in battery electric as we are with engines.\nJerry Revich: I appreciate the discussion. Thanks.\nTom Linebarger: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Tom, I wonder if you could kind of update us on how the naturaliser pipeline is developing. I think we've seen some of the companies in the industry just a really robust demand growth since the start of the year. And if you can also comment, obviously it's not set in stone, but there appear to be some pretty healthy incentives for nitrogen production in the reconciliational provision. So just wondering if you'd comment on potential impact of that outgrow the business?\nTom Linebarger: Yeah. He thinks -- no I appreciate your question and the answer is, we have continued to see backlog growth in the electrolyzer business, and I'd say the big strategic move we wanted to make was to add some bigger projects to the backlog and those conversations have been going much better in a backlog. I think last time we checked with 60 megawatts or something quite a good backlog, some newer larger projects which were exciting to add in there. And of course the problem with larger projects, they take longer to get together, and more likely delays in funding, but that's where the market's going. We need to have those big ones, so it was good to see some of those come into backlog. and I would just say that the interest in electrolyzers is still quite strong. As you mentioned, the bill -- the Build Back Better Plan has some incentives in there for producing hydrogen, especially low -- carbon-free ammonia. We think that's going to be a good use of electrolyzers in the early phase of electrolyzers. We see it in Europe where there's a carbon price already. We see it in some fertilizer-related projects and it's an area where there's a lot of carbon used in fertilizer through gray hydrogen and making that hydrogen green is a way -- there's already demand calculations about how to get cost. Equivalency are pretty straightforward. They're not easy, they take some funding and they take some incentives, which is why you see those in the bill. But once you do the calculations, you can see how you can get there, so I do expect that to be one of the markets that's likely to move more quickly, especially if those incentives make it through into law. I do think it will promote the green hydrogen -- green nitrogen, I guess the green ammonia business pretty quickly in the U.S.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks. And then just on a different topic, wonder if we could get any update on the filtration business, particularly in light of the comments made earlier about some of the operational changes or realignment from a high level that you're planning. Where you at in terms of exploring the alternatives for that business?\nMark Smith: Hi Noah, this is Mark. Yes, we continue to make progress in pursuing the alternatives for that business. Our plans are unchanged and you should expect an update in the new year as we continue that work. Will be no -- I don't anticipate any significant change in the remaining three months. But an update in the new year and the direction and the enthusiasm for that process remains unchecked. And I will just say the performance of that business has also been very strong this year that. It's embedded within the components business, but the business continues to do very well.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. Thanks very much, Mark.\nMark Smith: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Elkott of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. So guys, in the U.S., we're looking at significant upcycles in truck production as well as construction and mining equipment. As these upcycles begin to unfold, are there opportunities for you guys to increase the percentage of your engines with your customers, both on-highway and off-highway? And if I take it a bit longer term, are there opportunities for potentially gaining new customers who may currently be fully integrated?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, great question. We are constantly working to make sure that we have the most competitive engine in the market that drives end-user pull and grows our position in the market and also ensuring that we have capacity to meet OEM s' needs through strong cycles. And we continue to have conversations. You've seen announcements around the partnerships with Isuzu, with Hino, with Dymo. We're continuing to have those conversations with customers that may not offer Cummins engines today to introduce those in the future. So we expect that those opportunities will continue over time.\nMatt Elkott: So generally, during an OEM cyclical production up-cycle, does the vertical integration usually go up or down for the OEMS?\nTom Linebarger: Matt, it depends, but at the very top of the market, generally speaking, our penetration goes up a little bit because they run out of capacity if they use both, if they have both their own demand and ours. But again, generally is not a good indicator for a given quarter and as Mark was saying earlier, quarter-to-quarter variation is pretty high because they may have backlogs. In this case, they may have unfinished trucks with more of their engine. So just quarter-to-quarter, it's hard to see. What's more is because of the supply chain challenges, right now, OEM truck production is capped by suppliers. So we're not anywhere near the maximum production of the industry today. I mean, we hope to be based on what engine users demand, but we're not. We're in an area where they can produce more if they could get more parts. So I think we're not really near the spot that you're asking about in terms of industry production.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. Next [Indiscernible] Tom and then just one follow-up question on the natural gas engine. In the U.S. it's very small. I think it's -- you guys produce about 10,000 engines and you dominate the market. With the 15-liter engine, can you talk about the growth opportunity and when you could see it unfold? I mean, is it going to be a meaningful opportunity next year or is this more longer-term?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So the plan -- we've announced that we're bringing this N15 natural gas engine that we have in production in China now into the U.S. market by '24. So we're couple of years out from offering that product. As I've talked to end customers, they are very excited about this product and in particular, as they pursue their own goals for carbon reduction. In the coming years, they see natural gas as a great way to meet those, including using renewable natural gas. So we expect some upside opportunities as we bring that new platform into the market and also some growing interest yo natural gas in the market.\nMark Smith: Which again should boost our share given our position in natural gas, yeah.\nMatt Elkott: Thank you very much.\nTom Linebarger: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. You guys touched on pricing earlier, could you remind us maybe just give a quick recap overview of how pricing works on engine platforms. Is that the only one where you have constraints on what price that includes material costs, escalators, but not freight maybe if I understand right. And then, what portion of the mix do you then have to go after things like freight on?\nTom Linebarger: Broadly speaking, Rob, the way it works is that we have OEM long-term agreements with large customers for engines and the major components. That's the sort of sectors where you'll see some of those long-term agreements. The benefit of those, of course, is that we can count on continued customer orders over a period of time over phase of production of trucks and engines. And the pricing arrangements in those for the most part, again, they're -- each one's a little different, but the general deal is it on basic material costs. There's an escalator or a pass-through, and on the rest, you need to negotiate if you want to make a change. Doesn't mean you can't negotiate, just means you have to negotiate with your partner. And then on generator sets and aftermarket where we go directly to retail customers, then we only have what's on the order book as what's what you can -- you can't price on. So as Mark and Jen said, we -- this year, we priced in the aftermarket. Early in the year, we priced in the aftermarket again. In the middle of the year, and we always are looking back at that to see if we should do more. And then gen sets we also move pricing right away. And then now what we're doing is talking with all of our OEM customers about the fact that we've had these escalators, not just freight, by the way, freight, logistics, material costs, special shipments as a result of delays in semiconductors, and other products that we want to recover from them, and we're in negotiations with them now.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Tom, thinking about an overview on -- you touched on it earlier on semiconductors. Do you have a sense on when you think the industry be in better shape and what does Cummins doing specifically I'd love your re-qualifying supplier, qualifying new suppliers, redesigning chips, etc, before the industry gets better? I'll stop there, thanks.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, I will comment on that one. So it's something we've been working really closely throughout the year and we've started to see some improvement quarter-over-quarter since the middle of the year and supply of microprocessors for most of our components that we've seen some growing disruption on other electrical components. That has become a bigger issue for us in the second half of the year. And we have also in parallel been working and I think we'll revisit inventory strategies as we are able to build inventory. Not today in the current very constrained environment. And we're also looking at, sourcing strategy and doing dual-sourcing back all the way to a tier 3 level to make sure we've got more flexibility in the future.\nTom Linebarger: And Rob, the thing we really needed in the U.S of course, as we need, we need domestic semiconductor production that's targeted at the automotive industry. That's -- I mean, that's -- I don't mean to be pie in the sky about it, but strategically, it's kind of a nightmare that we only have -- all those semiconductor wafers are coming from pretty much one factory or one set of factories in Taiwan, and that we're a very small part of that Company's output. That's not the ideal situation for a supply chain. So if you ever said, hey, what's the strategic plan? The strategic plan has to be defined semiconductor manufacturers who think the automotive industry is more critical to their success and ideally to have some closer to shore onshore so that we can look at the total capacity and demand, because right now most automotive -- most trucks and buses are adding a significant portion of electronics. Each revolution or each time that their new product ramps come out, they add 30% more chips or sensors or something, and that's not the way the industry semiconductor -- the capacity of the semiconductors is moving. So we need to add more capacity and we need to add it -- target it at those customers.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you.\nJack Kienzler: Thank you, Tom. And thank you, everybody. I believe that concludes our teleconference today. As always, thank you to everybody for your continued interest in Cummins and for joining today. I will be available for questions after the call. Thank you again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event.

            "name": "Mark Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. There are four key takeaways from our third quarter results. End customer demand remains strong in the third quarter, driving sales growth -- strong sales growth across most end markets and businesses outside of China, where truck and construction demand has weakened in line with our expectations. Global supply chains remain constrained, impacting our industry's ability to meet strong customer demand, and resulting in higher freight, labor, and logistics expenses and rising material costs. As a result of the continued supply challenges and associated costs, we are lowering our full-year sales and profitability outlook even though underlying demand remains very strong. Finally, we'll return $345 million to shareholders through cash dividends, and share repurchases in the quarter, and a total of $1.83 billion for the first 9 months of the year consistent with our plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year. Now let me go into more details on the third quarter. Revenues were $6 billion, an increase of 17% from a year ago. Sales in North America grew 13% and international revenues rose 22%. EBITDA was $862 million dollars or 14.4% of sales for the quarter, compared to $876 million or 17.1% of sales a year ago. As a reminder, EBITDA in Q3 last year would lose by $90 million of temporary salary reductions, and the $44 million VAT recovery in Brazil. Along with the strong demand, the key feature of our performance in Q3 was that our gross margin continues to be challenged by the supply chain constraints and elevated costs. gross margin of $1.4 billion or 23.7% of sales increased by $65 million but declined as a percent of sales by 270 basis points. Global supply chain constraints continue to impact the industry's ability to meet elevated and the cost demand and have resulted in higher costs. We incurred approximately $90 million of additional freight, labor and logistics costs in the third quarter. in addition to rising material costs, partially offset by increased pricing in the aftermarket. SG&A expenses increased by $38 million or 7%, and research expenses increased by $42 million or 19% from a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation expenses. As a reminder, due to the significant uncertainty the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented temporary salary reductions in April 2020, through the end of September last year. These salary reductions resulted in approximately $90 million of pre -tax savings for the Company last year and impacted gross margin and our operating expenses and impacted the comparisons of the results of all of our operating segments. Joint venture income was $94 million in the third quarter, down slightly from $98 million a year ago due primarily to weaker demand for both trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income of $32 million increased by $11 million year-over-year. Net earnings for the quarter were $534 million or $3.69 per diluted share compared to $501 million or $3.36 per share from a year ago, primarily due to a lower tax rate and a reduced share count. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.9%. Our income tax expense included favorable discrete items of $11 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $569 million dollars compared to $1.2 billion dollars a year ago. An increase in working capital led to the lower operating cash flow for this quarter. Now, let me comment on segment performance and our latest guidance for the full-year 2021. For the engine segment, third quarter revenues increased 22% from a year ago, driven by increased demand for trucks in the U.S. and construction equipment in the U.S. and Europe. EBITDA decreased from 18.1% to 15.2%, primarily driven by higher supply chain costs, lower joint venture income, and higher compensation expense, partially offset by the benefits of stronger volumes and lower warranty expense. But the full year, we've reduced our revenue guidance to be 24% at the midpoint, down 1% for the full year. We now expect EBITDA margins to be between 14.2% and 14.7% a little below our prior year guidance of 14.5% to 15% primarily due to the weaker sales on ongoing supply chain challenges. In the distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago. EBITDA increased in dollars but decreased as a percent of sales from 10.6% to 9.8% primarily due to some of the supply chain challenges but again the higher compensation costs. We have maintained our 2021 outlook for distribution segment revenues to be up 8% and increased EBITDA margins to 9.3% of sales at the midpoint of our guidance. Component segment, revenues increased 16% in the third quarter, driven primarily by stronger demand for trucks in North America. EBITDA decreased from 16.9% to 14.1% primarily due to higher supply chain costs and higher warranty expenses compared to very, very low cost of quality in the year-ago quarter. For the full year, we now expect components revenue to increase 28%, lower than our prior guidance of up 32%, primarily driven by a weaker outlook in North America and slightly lower outlook for China truck. We have also lowered our forecast EBITDA margins for the segment to be at 15.5% of sales at the midpoint, down from our prior guidance of 17%, as this segment is being more hardly -- has been hit harder by the supply chain challenges and the slowdown in truck production in North America and China. In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 19% in the third quarter, driven by stronger demand for power generation and mining equipment. EBITDA increased by $33 million, and expanded by 10.3 to 11.5% of sales, primarily due to the benefits of higher volumes and lower product coverage expense. Partially offset by elevated supply chain costs. For the full year we're increasing our power systems revenue guidance to be up 22% from our prior guide of 18% growth driven primarily by a stronger outlook in the mining segment. We're also increasing our EBITDA margin forecast to be 11.5% of sales at the midpoint from our prior guidance of 11.25. In the new power segment, revenue increased $23 million, up 28% due to stronger sales of battery electric system. EBITDA losses for the quarter were $58 million as we continue to invest in new products and scale up ahead of widespread adoption of the new technologies that we're developing. For the full year, we now project new power revenues of $120 million at the midpoint, and EBITDA losses to be in the range of $200 million. We expect total Company revenues now to grow approximately 20% at the low-end of our prior guidance. We're also lowering our EBITDA margin guidance to be approximately 15% for the full year, down from our prior guidance of 15.5% to 16%. A slower pace of improvement in North American truck production and continued elevated costs associated with the global supply chain challenges were the primary drivers of the lower outlook. We expect joint venture earnings to be up 10% for this year in line with our prior [Indiscernible]. We're forecasting our full-year effective tax rate to be 21.5%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures were a $150 million in the quarter, up from a $116 million a year ago, when we continue to expect full-year capital spend of between $725-$775 million. To summarize, we faced incredibly strong demand in many of our core markets but continue to face global supply chain challenges which have impacted our cost base, and more so than we'd expected in the second half of the year. However, this end customer demand remains strong, outpacing supply in many important markets and setting us up for a strong 2022, assuming the global economy remains strong. I want to thank all of our employees for their tireless work this year to ensure that we've meet the needs of our customers while continuing to deliver solid financial results. We continue to prioritize improving our performance cycle-over-cycle, investing in technologies that will power profitable growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. Thank you for your interest today. And now let me turn it back over to Jack. Happy to do that and good morning, Steve. So yes, we are almost 2% worse between the price we've recovered in -- well, not recovered. The price increases that we've made principally in the aftermarket this year, which has added about 70 basis points to our results. And we've lost yeah, more than 2.5 points between the premium freight, rising material costs, and inefficiencies in our operations. And that's a little bit -- that's higher obviously than when anticipated 3 months ago. We did see a reduction in premium freight from the second quarter to the third quarter, but we started to see more increase on the material cost side. I will just say this continues to be a high area of focus both on our operation side and also working through this with suppliers and customers and implementing price increases. Thank you. What I would add Tim is what we see is our products are performing incredibly well. We see it in our financials with very positive results on cost of quality and overall strong sense of enthusiasm for the products that we're putting in the market. Invariably, you're going to get some volatility quarter-to-quarter, as we always do, but we feel really good about the position of our products in the market. I think that's the message when you step back and when we're done with this year and and we look at the message you want you to leave with, and, of course, we're optimistic about picking up more business over time. If I just step back because there's a lot of noise year-over-year because some of the actions we took last year, the boosted results for us to step back from the noise of the numbers. I'll come back to that in a moment. Really, we're wrestling with three issues in that business that are somewhat different than we'd anticipated 3 or 6 months ago. Number one, for the production in North America has not picked up in the second half of the year, if anything, it's drifted down a little bit. And we were counting on that in our guidance. So we think underlying demand supports are robust environment for next year, and that should take care of itself. Number 2, whilst we anticipated a sharp drop in the second half of the year in China and that's playing out largely as we've expected. This business is doing a major product transition for NS-5 to NS-6. And in variable when we start with the launch of new products, will below optimal scale, demand is still pretty light for NS-6 so as we ramp up, we'd expect margins to recover. The bigger challenge, or the more, naughty challenges the rise in supply chain costs, which is really what we've seen when in the first half of the year we saw OEMS principally, availability impacting our operations, supply chain and the engine business. We've seen that spread more to more electrical components. And what's happened is the components business has picked up more cost and efficiency. So that one's not you were working through all that. Yes, we got the metal costs, we got the normal contractual adjustments around that. But it's that focus on the supply chain and the other actions that we talked about at the start of the call that we're focused on here. But I just wanted to try and simplify the message. There's a lot of noise out there. I'll just say one other thing just -- you didn't ask me, just clear up some noise I hear. Whilst -- in the explanations, we mentioned higher product coverage costs in this segment, it's compared to an extraordinarily low number last year. There's no big charge for product coverage or warranty in the segments. I just wanted to clear that up for other listeners. Thank you. Cheers, Tim. Yeah. Hi Noah, this is Mark. Yes, we continue to make progress in pursuing the alternatives for that business. Our plans are unchanged and you should expect an update in the new year as we continue that work. Will be no -- I don't anticipate any significant change in the remaining three months. But an update in the new year and the direction and the enthusiasm for that process remains unchecked. And I will just say the performance of that business has also been very strong this year that. It's embedded within the components business, but the business continues to do very well. Thanks. Which again should boost our share given our position in natural gas, yeah."

            "name": "Tom Linebarger",
            "content": "Thank you, Jack and good morning. Welcome everybody. I'll start with a summary of our Third Quarter financial results and our market trends by region and finish with a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2021. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Demand remains strong in the third quarter as the global economy continued to improve, driving strong sales growth across most businesses and regions outside of China. In China, industry-wide sales of trucks and construction equipment is slowed sharply, but in line with our expectations. We remain encouraged by the economic trends in our markets, which point to strong end-user demand extending into 2022. We also continue to see orders for our products outpaced our competition as a result of their strong performance in the field. Unfortunately, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact our ability to produce and ship products, driving up costs and limiting sales growth in the short run. These supply chain constraints are impacting our OEM customers in much the same way. Before getting further into our results, I want to take a moment to highlight a couple of strategic milestones in the evolution of our next-generation products and technologies. In October, we announced that we will bring a 15-liter natural gas engine for heavy-duty trucks to the North American market. This engine was launched earlier this year in China and has been well-received in the market, demonstrating excellent performance and reliability this far. The 15-liter natural gas engine is an important part of our path to zero emission strategy, by offering a significant reduction in both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases in a product that's available today and utilizes existing infrastructure. Equally exciting is that this engine is designed to accept a range of gases and renewable fuels, including hydrogen in the future. In fact, all of Cummins' engine platforms are being designed with the same fuel flexibility. At the same time, we are working with Chevron and others in the energy industry to increase the availability of renewable natural gas and other renewable fuels to ensure infrastructure is in place to meet our customers needs. We also signed a letter of intent to establish a joint venture between Rush Enterprises and Cummins, which will produce Cummins branded natural gas fuel delivery systems for the commercial vehicle market in North America, combining the strengths of momentum fuel technology's compressed natural gas fuel delivery systems and Cummins powertrain expertise along with the engineering and support infrastructure of both companies. These are important steps in expanding our portfolio of Power Solutions options to help customers meet their business goals and operation objectives, while also meeting increasingly stringent emission standards and achieving our customers sustainability goals. Now, I will comment on the overall Company performance for the third quarter of 2021 and cover some of our key markets. Revenues for the third quarter of 2021 were $6 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the third quarter of 2020. EBITDA was $862 million or 14.4% compared to $876 million or 17.1% a year ago. Higher freight and logistics expenses, rising material costs and other manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the ongoing supply chain challenges in our industry. More than offset the benefits of global volume in increases compared to the third quarter of last year. As a reminder, EBITDA in the third quarter of last year was helped by temporary salary reductions, which lowered our cost by approximately $90 million. Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 13% to $3.4 billion, driven by higher engine and component shipments across the heavy and medium-duty on highway markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 55,000 units, increase of 10% from 2020 levels. Cummins sold 22,000 heavy-duty engines in the same period, up 30% from 2020 levels. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 26,000 units in the third quarter, a decrease of 5% from 2020 levels, while our Cummins unit sales were 23,000, an increase of 25% in 2020. We shipped 43,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the third quarter of this year, a decrease of 2% from 2020 levels, but still a very strong quarter. Revenues for power generation grew by 2% due to higher demand in recreational vehicle, standby power, and datacenter markets. Our international revenues increased by 22% in the third quarter of 2021 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 11% due to lower demand in the medium and heavy-duty truck markets. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 217,000 units, a decrease of 53% as the industry works through the national standard 5 truck inventory on hand and lower demand for newer higher-cost national standard 6 unit. Our unit sales in units, including joint ventures, were 40,000, a decrease of 49% versus the third quarter last year. Our light-duty engine sales were 33,000, a decrease of 40% driven by supply chain constraints and weaker market demand. Industry demand for excavators in China in the third quarter were 56,000 units, a decrease of 15% from 2020 levels. Our units in Cummins sold were 88,600 units, a decrease of 20%. Power generation sales in China increased 52% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, based on strong demand in data centers and other backup power applications. We continue to hold a market-leading position in the data center segment in China, driven by strong end-user relationships and our compelling product offerings.  Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $520 million, an increase of 76% from the third quarter of 2020. Industry truck production increased by a 120%, while our shipments increased 135% as our joint venture partner continued to gain share. Demand for power generation and construction equipment also rebounded strongly in the third quarter compared to a very low base a year ago. In our Power Systems market, industrial engine revenue increased 33% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year driven by mining in oil and gas. In Brazil, our revenues increased 26% driven by increased demand across all end markets. Now let me quickly cover our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect our revenue to be at the lower end of our guidance are up approximately 20% versus 2020. EBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15%, below our previous guidance of 15.5% to 16% of sales. Our expected EBITDA margins are lower because of the persistence of the supply chain constraints and disruptions, which are now exacerbated by escalating material and freight prices. We've lowered our forecast for industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to 228,000 units, up 25% compared to 2020, but below our prior guidance of 264,000 units. This is again due to the supply chain constraints impacting our customers rather than a lack of end-user demand. In the medium-duty trucks market, we are decreasing our forecast for industry production to a 118,000 units, up 15% year-over-year, but below our prior guidance of 134,000 units. We expect our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be up 25% compared to 2020, an increase of 7.5% from our expectations three months ago. In China, we continue to expect domestic on-highway demand to decline from record levels a year ago. Our 2021 outlook for medium and heavy-duty truck market demand is 1.65 million units, and our 2021 outlook for light-duty trucks market is 2 million units; both unchanged from our previous guidance. We continue to expect industry sales of excavators to be flat with the record levels achieved in 2020 and unchanged from our previous guidance. In India, we anticipate industry demand for trucks to be up 75%,compared to levels experienced in 2020. And our other businesses are showing promising growth due to continued infrastructure investment, this is also unchanged from previous guidance. We now expect demand for mining engines, to increase 60% in 2021. Up from our expectation of 45% 3 months ago based on continued strength in commodity prices. We continue to expect global power generation revenue to increase 15%, primarily driven by the data-center and recreational vehicle markets. Summing up the quarter, strong demand across many of our markets drove continued sales growth in the third quarter. Despite the strong demand, supply chain constraints continue to significantly impact both our operations and those of our customers, resulting in higher material and logistics costs, as well as capping revenue growth. We are working collaboratively with our customers and suppliers to navigate these challenges and position the Company for better performance in 2022. Customers are recognizing the strong performance of our products, resulting in our sales growing faster than industry demand in a number of important markets. We continue to invest in bringing new technology to our customers, outgrowing our end markets, and providing strong cash returns to our shareholders. The Company expects to return over 75% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2021 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Thank you for your time today and now let me turn it over to Mark. Hey Steve, this is Tom, the one thing that everybody is still worried about in our industry is semiconductors. It's not that things haven't improved some because they have, but it's marginal improvement. It's still a really tight supply chain, so there's a lot of issues across the supply chain, labor shortages, freight, etc. But semiconductors look like they're -- they have a longer-term capacity issue and I'd also say the freight side of things just seems like it's not quite getting better yet when you look at where containers are and what ports look like. So there's no question that, as Mark said, internally, we are working as much as we can to address our cost side inefficiencies. He talked about going out and negotiating price increases, and as you know on the material cost side, those come automatically, but we'll have to negotiate for the rest. It's just that some of these things look like they are likely to be somewhat persistent. That doesn't mean we're not hoping to improve them all. I just want to be realistic about those. There'll be some element that looks like it goes into next year too. Yeah. Let me let Jen talk a little bit about how the China market is now and how we're seeing it, and I can jump back in and see us talk about sort of longer-term things. Yeah. I would just pick up from where Jen left off, the power shortages as she said. Some impacts on production, but not a huge cost impact. But as you suggested, Jamie, we do think it helps us in the market. And as I mentioned in my remarks, our power-gen business is positioned well in China and now I look at China and I see us positioned across all of our markets. The truck side, as Jen said, we've now got -- our automatic transmissions are taking off, our content across the engines is growing. There's more consolidation in the market. So as things start to come back, I think we're better positioned we've ever been. Add to it, that we're now doing electrolyzers with a partner in China. We've got fuel-cell launches in China. So on the new power side, while things are moving slower in China than maybe and people anticipated several years ago, that's just allowed us to position ourselves to be in those markets more strongly as they take off. So again, today -- looking where I am today, I'd say our position in China has really never been stronger. So, yeah. Do I wish the market was stronger this year? Sure. But I think as it turns back down, we're able to consolidate more and strengthen our position. Thanks Jamie. Hi Ann I'm Tom, it's good to hear you. I really don't know because again, there are, as you know, export, I mean, sorry, import caps on that too. So how much that's going to really impact prices is unclear to me. And demand, of course, for metals is pretty high now. So the markets are pretty well-supported. In fact, our mining, you saw our mining numbers are up and that's primarily driven by metal prices. So just in the U.S., it feels to me like it's going to have moderate long-term impact. Short-term, it may provide a little bit of relief, but I would have said that given the import caps, it's probably not a big move medium or long term. Well, as you know, the hydrogen investments would be the same. Still we would need to generate hydrogen and, of course, we need green hydrogen in order to actually reduce the CO2 impact of the fuel. And really, hydrogen combustion is a good answer. It's just not as efficient as a fuel cell. So if you're running our long-haul heavy-duty trucks where fuel is your number one cost or power energy is, then that efficiency increase from a fuel cell is going to be worth it to you. If you have a relatively short range or you have a vocational truck, our view is maybe a hydrogen engine might work for you, especially if the conversion to fuel cell is too expensive and you're not having that many units. So our view is there's a place for both, but if you want to think what's going to really drive the transportation economy 20 years -- 15 years from now, you're going to need the efficiency that a fuel cell, especially with an electric system, is going to provide. So our feeling still as fuel sales win, for the majority of the trucking industry, but we -- hydrogen engines are a real addition to the portfolio of products that are -- can be available across our markets. Ann [Indiscernible] Thank you, Ann. Hi, Jerry. Jerry, it's a terrific question, and as you can imagine, it's been on my mind for a while. We did -- early in the pandemic we did do some structural reform. I think we talked about on some previous calls trying to say, hey, well, the market's down, let's make sure that we get our capacity rightsize and I think we did some good work early on on that. But with the supply chain challenges, we've also seen a bunch of new problems that we weren't seeing before. You highlighted some of them. Do we have enough inventory in the right places? Are we outsourced in places we should be insourced? And then of course with trade challenges between countries, are we relying too much on cross-border trade. So all those things now are in our strategy looking forward about how we want to reposition our supply chain. So today what we're doing is trying to get our costs down, trying to get our production up to meet customer demand, and trying to keep our supply chain people at work. when it's -- they're basically working 24/7. It's been really, really rough, so I would just say that the strategic elements, while we're doing a lot of work and analysis on them, there's no question that we've taken a backseat to try to keep operations going in the last couple of quarters. But those issues are first and foremost, for us and the leadership team, thinking about how we want to position. And I will just say this, broadly speaking, what we're thinking about is we do need to reposition what we outsourced and what we in-source for the future, partly because of some of the supply chain challenges we've seen here, but also because the industry is likely to consolidate further. And we need to make sure that we can be the reliable supplier that we need to be for our customers. So we will be looking at that and thinking through where the right way to position ourselves in different supply chains is, but I think you've hit on a key point that there will be some optimization that will be helpful to us, both from a cost and reliability point-of-view overtime. As you said, off highway is more fragmented and generally speaking, conversations are a phase behind on highway in battery electric power trains, but they are common. As you'd guess, every major off highway producers trying to figure out what their long-term strategy is from carbon point of view and sustainability point of view. We are having conversations with many of them. In all cases, I think the battery electric conversation, it is at a high level strategically as the same thing. All of them need a solution. All of them want to figure out when is the costs -- the total cost of ownership for end-users work out and it generally doesn't today unless you're in a publicly financed application. If you're in a train or a bus or a ferry, okay. If you're in a commercially viable thing, it doesn't quite work out yet, but the numbers as you know are changing quickly, but it still doesn't work out. So they are trying to figure out how to position themselves for when it does work out, who they partner with, and how. And today, most of those partnership conversations are pushed out because there's not a viable offering to make today, nor is there a way to get to a viable offering within technologies and the costs as they are now. So everyone's looking forward trying to figure out what does it look like. Off-highway, I believe, strategically, will be in the same challenge that they're in today. Not enough volume to justify a special one, but very specific needs to their application. And our view is that Cummins will be well-positioned because we will have products and on-highway which will give us volume and scale and then we will have an understanding of their application and how to adapt the technologies most effectively to off-highway so that we'll represent a good partner to them, and as you guessed, that sort of the pitch I'm making to them now that we'd be the right partner for them in battery electric as we are with engines. Thank you. Yeah. He thinks -- no I appreciate your question and the answer is, we have continued to see backlog growth in the electrolyzer business, and I'd say the big strategic move we wanted to make was to add some bigger projects to the backlog and those conversations have been going much better in a backlog. I think last time we checked with 60 megawatts or something quite a good backlog, some newer larger projects which were exciting to add in there. And of course the problem with larger projects, they take longer to get together, and more likely delays in funding, but that's where the market's going. We need to have those big ones, so it was good to see some of those come into backlog. and I would just say that the interest in electrolyzers is still quite strong. As you mentioned, the bill -- the Build Back Better Plan has some incentives in there for producing hydrogen, especially low -- carbon-free ammonia. We think that's going to be a good use of electrolyzers in the early phase of electrolyzers. We see it in Europe where there's a carbon price already. We see it in some fertilizer-related projects and it's an area where there's a lot of carbon used in fertilizer through gray hydrogen and making that hydrogen green is a way -- there's already demand calculations about how to get cost. Equivalency are pretty straightforward. They're not easy, they take some funding and they take some incentives, which is why you see those in the bill. But once you do the calculations, you can see how you can get there, so I do expect that to be one of the markets that's likely to move more quickly, especially if those incentives make it through into law. I do think it will promote the green hydrogen -- green nitrogen, I guess the green ammonia business pretty quickly in the U.S. Matt, it depends, but at the very top of the market, generally speaking, our penetration goes up a little bit because they run out of capacity if they use both, if they have both their own demand and ours. But again, generally is not a good indicator for a given quarter and as Mark was saying earlier, quarter-to-quarter variation is pretty high because they may have backlogs. In this case, they may have unfinished trucks with more of their engine. So just quarter-to-quarter, it's hard to see. What's more is because of the supply chain challenges, right now, OEM truck production is capped by suppliers. So we're not anywhere near the maximum production of the industry today. I mean, we hope to be based on what engine users demand, but we're not. We're in an area where they can produce more if they could get more parts. So I think we're not really near the spot that you're asking about in terms of industry production. Thank you. Broadly speaking, Rob, the way it works is that we have OEM long-term agreements with large customers for engines and the major components. That's the sort of sectors where you'll see some of those long-term agreements. The benefit of those, of course, is that we can count on continued customer orders over a period of time over phase of production of trucks and engines. And the pricing arrangements in those for the most part, again, they're -- each one's a little different, but the general deal is it on basic material costs. There's an escalator or a pass-through, and on the rest, you need to negotiate if you want to make a change. Doesn't mean you can't negotiate, just means you have to negotiate with your partner. And then on generator sets and aftermarket where we go directly to retail customers, then we only have what's on the order book as what's what you can -- you can't price on. So as Mark and Jen said, we -- this year, we priced in the aftermarket. Early in the year, we priced in the aftermarket again. In the middle of the year, and we always are looking back at that to see if we should do more. And then gen sets we also move pricing right away. And then now what we're doing is talking with all of our OEM customers about the fact that we've had these escalators, not just freight, by the way, freight, logistics, material costs, special shipments as a result of delays in semiconductors, and other products that we want to recover from them, and we're in negotiations with them now. And Rob, the thing we really needed in the U.S of course, as we need, we need domestic semiconductor production that's targeted at the automotive industry. That's -- I mean, that's -- I don't mean to be pie in the sky about it, but strategically, it's kind of a nightmare that we only have -- all those semiconductor wafers are coming from pretty much one factory or one set of factories in Taiwan, and that we're a very small part of that Company's output. That's not the ideal situation for a supply chain. So if you ever said, hey, what's the strategic plan? The strategic plan has to be defined semiconductor manufacturers who think the automotive industry is more critical to their success and ideally to have some closer to shore onshore so that we can look at the total capacity and demand, because right now most automotive -- most trucks and buses are adding a significant portion of electronics. Each revolution or each time that their new product ramps come out, they add 30% more chips or sensors or something, and that's not the way the industry semiconductor -- the capacity of the semiconductors is moving. So we need to add more capacity and we need to add it -- target it at those customers."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris. \nChris Villavarayan: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to slide three. We had strong results this quarter, with $983 million in sales and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3%. Total company sales were up 13% year-over-year, as truck demand increased in all our global markets. Free cash flow performance was excellent this quarter, coming in at $47 million. This was one of our highest second quarter cash flows since we began the implants in 2013. Once again, the Meritor team demonstrated its ability to successfully respond to markets. Even with the sharp increase in volumes and supply chain challenges, we maintain excellent delivery and quality performance for our customers, while converting increased sales to profits at expected levels. Looking at the full fiscal year, we're holding our sales, margin and cash flow guidance, despite indications that we will have one of the largest unfavorable steel impacts we have seen, in addition to higher expense in electric powertrain development, as we ramp up production capabilities to meet the increasing demand. Carl will provide more detail, but our ability to offset these headwinds reflects the consistent strong execution you expect from us. We have a brand-new electrification program to announce this quarter, in addition to an exciting new opportunity to accelerate development of our 17Xe electric powertrain in Europe. And in our core business, we have recently finalized long-term agreements with two global OE customers. Please move to slide four. In the second quarter, we extended our agreement with Navistar through 2026. We are pleased to continue our long-standing relationship with Navistar, as it becomes part of the Traton family. This agreement extends our current relationship, while providing opportunity for future growth in our major product categories of axles, brakes and drivelines. We also completed a new agreement with IVECO in Europe through 2024. This includes the supply of single reduction axles and strengthens our successful business relationship between our companies. It also provides the opportunity for future growth on other product lines. With Navistar and IVECO complete, most of our long-term agreements with major customers have been renewed well past the 2022 time frame. Moving to electrification on slide 5. We are pleased to announce a new collaboration with Hexagon Purus Systems, a global leader in zero emission e-mobility. Hexagon will integrate Meritor's 14Xe powertrain into its Class 6, Class 7 box trucks and Class 8 6x4 vehicles starting 2021. Customers, including PACCAR, AutoCar, line electric Volta trucks and Hexagon have chosen Meritor's 14Xe integrated electric powertrain. We believe this is market validation of its industry-leading performance. In early 2020, we announced an agreement with PACCAR to be the initial launch partner and supplier for the integration of the fully functional battery electric systems on the Kenworth T680 and Peterbilt 579 and 520 electric vehicles. We have begun prototype production and PACCAR is performing validation testing on its test tracks. It's very exciting for us to see these fully electric vehicles being assembled. Soon these and many others with Meritor's preferred electric powertrain solutions will be fully operational on roads and highways. Please take a minute to view a video of this truck in motion on meritor.com. This footage was shot last week, at our Escondido California facility. With market adoption growing for our 14Xe, we're now shifting the focus to the development of the 17Xe platform in Europe. Last month, we learnt we were a grant recipient of the advanced propulsion center in the United Kingdom. This grant will partially fund the development of Meritor 17Xe. After a comprehensive months-long nomination and consideration process, we were thrilled to be selected along with our consortium partners Danfoss Editron and Electra Commercial Vehicles. This grant totaling almost \u00a316 million will rapidly accelerate development of this product, that is designed for multiple vehicle platforms and extend our ability to offer Meritor's e-powertrain solutions for the European market. We believe demand for this product will grow because of the EU 2025 CO2 reduction targets. Stricter targets will start applying in 2030 and by 2040 all new trucks sold in Europe will need to be fossil-free to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The 17Xe is another significant step towards completing our electric powertrain portfolio. Carl, will now provide details on our financial results.\nCarl Anderson: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our second quarter financial results and provide an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. As Chris mentioned at the beginning of the call, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.3%, and we generated $47 million of free cash flow. Now, let's review our financial results compared to the prior year on slide 6. Before I continue, I want to highlight a revision we are making to our presentation of two non-GAAP measures, adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share. To better align with SEC guidance, we will no longer include in non-GAAP measures the adjustment for non-cash tax expense related to the use of deferred tax assets in jurisdictions with net operating loss carryforwards or tax credits. It is important to note, this is a change to our reporting metrics only as the underlying availability and benefit of tax attributes to offset future taxable income has not changed. We expect to maintain an effective cash tax rate of approximately 15% through the M2022 planning cycle. In the appendix, we have also updated prior periods to reflect this change providing for consistent comparatives. Now let's review the details of our financial results. Beginning with the total company, revenue came in at $983 million, up $112 million from the same period last year. As economies rebounded globally, we saw increased truck production in all of our markets. Net income from continuing operations was $63 million, compared to $240 million last year. As a reminder, prior year results include $203 million of after-tax income related to the termination of the distribution arrangement we had with WABCO. This was partially offset by the recognition of value-added tax credits in our wholly owned Brazilian entity of $22 million or $15 million net of tax during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $111 million, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3%, a decrease of 100 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA this quarter excludes the $22 million Brazil value-added tax credit I previously mentioned. The decrease in margin was primarily driven by an approximately $20 million impact from incentive compensation cost compared to the prior period. Keep in mind, last year we significantly reduced our incentive compensation accrual at the onset of the pandemic. Additionally, we experienced higher freight costs as compared to a year ago. This higher expense was offset by cost reduction actions executed in the second half of last year. Overall, we were pleased with our margin performance, especially given some of these cost headwinds. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.68, up $0.04 from last year. And free cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $47 million. Last year we generated $292 million of free cash flow, which included $265 million related to our distribution agreement termination. If you adjust for the one-time impact from last year, free cash flow improved $20 million year-over-year. Based on our market outlook and expectations on cash flow generation going forward, we are in a position to return to a more normalized level of cash on our balance sheet. We therefore are announcing the redemption of the remaining 6.25% notes due in 2024. The $175 million principal balance will be redeemed at the call price of just over 101%, utilizing available cash on hand, which was $321 million at the end of the second quarter. Our objective of maintaining BB credit metrics through market cycles was reinforced this past year, as we were able to successfully manage through the onset of the pandemic. Upon completion of the debt repurchase, our gross debt balances will be similar to where we were pre-COVID. We were also on track for net leverage to be approximately two times this year and plan for a further step down in 2022. Now let's look at our segment results compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck increased by 23%, driven by higher global truck production in all markets. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $73 million, up $15 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 9.4%, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue and by cost reductions actions executed last year. This was partially offset by higher incentive compensation and freight costs. Aftermarket and industrial sales were $247 million in the second quarter, down $30 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by the termination of our distribution arrangement, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.  Segment adjusted EBITDA was down $12 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 and segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 13.8%. The decreases were driven primarily by the impact from the termination of our distribution arrangement and increased incentive compensation costs, partially offset by cost reduction actions.  Before I review our current global market outlook on slide 7, I want to provide an update on supply chain constraints in the markets we are closely monitoring. Global supply chains, primarily for semiconductors have become constrained during this global production upturn. This has affected many global manufacturing industries including commercial trucks. We are seeing some impact to production schedules as a result.  In India, the current wave of the pandemic is having a significant impact on the country, which could affect the ability of our OE customers and suppliers to manufacture in the short run. Demand however, remains high in all of our markets. In particular, order activity in the North America Class 8 market continues to be robust averaging over 40,000 units per month in our fiscal second quarter and cancellation rates remain very low.  Overall, as we assess all of the pluses and minuses, we are keeping our global production outlook unchanged as we balance strong global demand with potential supply chain constraints.  Let's turn to slide 8 for an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Consistent with our market assumptions, we are holding forecasted sales to be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.8 billion unchanged from our prior forecast. We are also maintaining our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance steady at an expected range of 10.6% to 10.8%. We are however seeing steel costs continue to increase. Since September hot-rolled coil prices have increased more than 130% and scrap prices are up nearly 100%.  The price movement in steel has been the most severe and rapid increase we have seen over the past 10 years. As a result, we now anticipate a full year headwind of $25 million to $30 million in higher steel costs up $10 million from our prior review. Most of this impact will be felt in our third fiscal quarter as prices begin to reset with our steel suppliers.  While this is a significant headwind in 2021, we do a pass-through mechanism in place with our customers, which are typically on a three- to six-month lag. We expect to see most of this recovery beginning in early fiscal year in 2022.  Additionally, we are increasing our electrification spend between $5 million to $10 million from our prior guidance as we continue to respond to this growing opportunity. While we are experiencing these higher costs, we expect to be able to offset most of these increases through continued operational performance. Our purchasing team has done an excellent job in driving material performance savings and we continue to see the benefits from cost reduction actions executed last year.  Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is now in the range of $2.15 to $2.30. This reflects the impact from the adjustment for non-cash taxes as well as the lower interest expense expected from the bond redemption. Our effective cash tax rate of approximately 15% in fiscal 2021 remains unchanged.  And finally, we are maintaining our expectation to generate between $110 million to $125 million of free cash flow. Overall, the team is doing a fantastic job, managing through the challenges of the strong global rebound and deliver a solid glide path to M2022.  Now I will turn the call back over to Chris. \nChris Villavarayan: Thanks, Carl. Let's turn to slide 9. While it is difficult to schedule events with certainty, we're planning to hold our Analyst Day in person this year in New York. More details will be provided in the coming months. At that time we will present M2025. We will move of course -- we will of course closely monitor the situation as we move closer to this date to ensure we can meet safely. Before we close I would like to express our concern for the serious situation occurring in India as the pandemic worsens. Our team in the region has taken actions to help employees and the community through care centers, vaccination and mobile testing facilities and we plan to do more. Our thoughts are with our colleagues and their families during this crisis. Again, I want to thank you for joining us today to review Meritor's second quarter results and welcome any questions you may have at this time. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of James Picariello of KeyBanc. \nJames Picariello: Hey, good morning.\nChris Villavarayan: Good morning, James.\nJames Picariello: Just within the company's reiterated guide for the year, you're now anticipating what was I think referred to as record commodity inflation in the back half, right not surprisingly, but can you help quantify what the net headwind exposure is relative to what will likely flow through within your recovery mechanism just to get a sense of that net exposure? \nCarl Anderson: Sure. James, it's Carl. As it relates to steel prices, which is the really primary driver for us we do expect it to be year-over-year about $25 million to $30 million headwind in fiscal 2021. So if you think about the recovery mechanisms as that begins to kind of flow through that will come through really beginning in fiscal -- the first part of fiscal 2022. And so of that we would expect to be recovering around probably $20 million of that number as we go forward. \nJames Picariello: Okay. No that's really helpful. Just from an industry standpoint focusing on the North American market for a second, I mean again from an industry standpoint we're trying to get near record order levels. This year the industry backlogs are also going to be at or close to all-time highs. Are you seeing anything unique in terms of builds build commitments build slot commitments for next year at this point? It just seems as that's where we're going to be especially given the temporary chip shortage impacts which I think are also proving to be more muted. Just seems like we're on track for a really, really strong volumes next year. \nChris Villavarayan: For sure, James. I'll take that. So when you think about it it's beyond the last three months. If you look at it it's the last six months. Order intake has come in at 40 or above 40. And to your point, backlogs are passing I think, I believe 300,000. And for our fiscal year right now the midpoint with the recent change is -- it's 285000 for the fiscal between ACT and FTR. And if you look at the midpoint for next year for the heavy market, it's at about 340. So to your point great highs and you got to believe the Texas storms resolved, as well as the fire in Japan. So the chip shortage will get resolved here shortly or will improve shortly. We do believe there is impact through the next couple of quarters, but it eventually should improve. So again we believe there's a strong 2022 ahead of us as well. \nJames Picariello: Got it. If I could just squeeze one more in. Within the aftermarket and industrial segment this quarter's -- the second quarter's margins was there anything within that related to the timing of price increases or excess of premium freight? Just any color on that segment's margins? \nCarl Anderson: Yes, James, it was really just driven by a couple of factors. One was, we did see some higher freight costs in the second quarter, as well as a little bit higher cost from steel that affected the aftermarket business.\nJames Picariello: Thanks.\nCarl Anderson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you. Appreciate it. So I think just to maybe sort of to get a little better sense for some of the costs you talked about Carl in the back half, I think, if we look at the guidance it still implies on a year-over-year basis about 20% incrementals. But I think that seems to be maybe some of the base period in the map, because is it fair to assume that sequentially we should see maybe decrementals a little bit higher than normal given some of the headwinds and then as you can start to get some of those recovery mechanisms back next year that reverts?\nCarl Anderson: I think that's the right way to think about it Joe. If you look at the six months EBITDA margin performance to-date, we're right around 11.4%. So if you think what our guide is of 10.6% to 10.8% that does imply the second half margins will be about 10% on roughly the same type of revenue.\nJoseph Spak: Right. Right. Okay. Thank you for that. Just a bigger picture question on electrification. I know you have to --you're up in the spend again here. In the past when you've talked about that it's really sort of been to support programs that you think are sooner rather than later. So maybe if you could just sort of confirm again if that increase of 5% to 10% is for that. And then somewhat related on electrification, can you talk at all about your ability to attach other Meritor products like maybe disc brakes, for instance, like when you get eAxle limbs like is there a pretty high attach rate for Meritor when you're able to do that?\nCarl Anderson: Absolutely Joe, but I'll start with the first question. First, I think, glad to see the backlog continuing to grow. As you remember, we talked about having this $500 million target for electrification as our revenue pipeline. We accomplished $400 million of that with the -- at the last quarter. And so with this announcement with Hexagon, we've taken a chunk of that. So we continue to see the growth. And to put it in perspective of spend, if you go back to 2019, we spent about $12 million. Last year we spent $21 million, and this year we're moving it up to $35 million to $40 million. So we're almost doubling it per year, and it's primarily because of the wins and it's essentially application and testing of our products as it wins with more customers. To your second question, the ability to attach components, absolutely, we do see a path with brakes -- as primarily with brakes with many of the customers as an opportunity to grow business as well. \nJoseph Spak: But when you up your electrification backlog, I mean, those associated products I am assuming are not in that. So is it fair to assume the other side of your backlog is being benefited too by the electrification wins?\nCarl Anderson: It is on, let's call it, everybody that is, let's call it, new entrants coming into the market. So when you think about the new entrants, we have a significant share of the existing traditional business. So it is on the new business, but you also have to take into account when you think about electrification always remember it's five times and up to five times content on a 14Xe, for example. So, we're already seeing that growth as well.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. Carl maybe just a quick one on -- thanks for the color on the tax rate and sort of the change in guidance. I think you used to sort of point to mid-teens with the way you sort of adjusted. So, should we model something more like 20% in the outer years now given the change?\nChris Villavarayan: Well, I think it's -- Joe to that point, it's 15% definitely through 2022. I think once you start getting past 2022 you got to 2023 and 2024; it could begin to moderately step up. So, you're probably not too far off with that assumption.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. Thanks very much.\nChris Villavarayan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. \nBen Fung: Hi, good morning. This is Ben Fung form JPMorgan for Ryan. I just have two questions. The first one is what is your view on the impact of higher labor cost to margin and production start to come back? And on the same note, how are you seeing freight cost progressing through the rest of the year? I know that someone in the aftermarket last week said something about the freight cost could be two or three times higher than they're seeing right now. So, how much impact to margin do you expect this headwind? And what are some factors that can be used to offset the impact? Thank you.\nChris Villavarayan: Absolutely. So, let me start with the first question specific to labor. It's a red hot market out there as you could see with the first question. There's significant drive and demand for the product. And I think it's running right through the economy GDPB being strong and consumer spending. So, in essence, we were able to drive that -- some of that recovery is specific to that with some of our customers. However, on top of that, it's really about operational performance. It's driving incremental operational performance whether it's labor and burden in how we look at our lines or whether it's how we look at material opportunities. So, that's how we drive that savings to offset labor. Specific to freight, we're seeing about three times more freight in terms of cost to your point whether it's on ocean or internal as well. And for those elements what we are again doing is trying to offset a lot of that with -- sorry with material performance and operational performance. But on top of that we also look at working with our customers as well.\nBen Fung: And I'm sorry to ask. So, this is pretty cost and everything already factored in the guidance, right?\nCarl Anderson: Yes, it is. Yes. And to add to what Chris said, as we look at just overall freight costs in our first quarter, we did experience probably higher premium costs associated with the rapid increase in production that we saw in the first quarter. But the -- what we're seeing is kind of just the basic run rate with cost today is all factored into our guidance.\nBen Fung: Thank you. Very helpful. And my second question is on the RV business. So, the RV demand has been very strong in the last few months and just this morning an RV dealer up their adjusted EBITDA guidance materially. Can you talk about the opportunity for growth in this area of the business? And I think last quarter you mentioned something about independent suspension. With wheels and motors for RVs? And if you can please just give any update on that? Thank you.\nCarl Anderson: Absolutely. So, the industrial specialty and off-highway markets are incredibly important for us. This is why we did the AxleTech and Fabco acquisitions two years ago. And so we are seeing the fruits of those acquisitions as we think through 2022 and our -- as we look at our revenue pipeline growth. When we think about the core business and as we have talked about exceeding our revenue targets for 2022, a lot of it is coming in our industrial Defense & Specialty business and a lot of it is driven by this. So we are seeing that growth. Again last quarter we talked about developing an independent suspension for this market. And it is going into production this year and it will be in run-rate next year. And then second is we're also developing a similar system on the electric side. So we're looking at an electric platform that requires to accomplish us the same thing as well for the RV space.\nBen Fung: Thank you very much for taking my question.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan of Stifel.\nMatt Milask: Hey good morning, this is Matt Milask on for Bruce Chan.\nChris Villavarayan: Good morning Matt.\nMatt Milask: Morning. With regards to higher freight costs, you mentioned one of the mitigating things that you're doing is working with customers. Any additional color we can get around there and how those conversations might be going?\nCarl Anderson: Sure. I think when we -- at this point, we are working with customers that we have agreements in certain regions. And as you could imagine, they are hard agreements and they take a while to work through. And it's a discussion that we are working through and we are seeing the benefits in some areas.\nMatt Milask: Thanks a lot.\nChris Villavarayan: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi.\nItay Michaeli: Good morning everybody. Just two quick ones for me. First just a little bit of housekeeping on CapEx. I mean, it looks like it's still running maybe below the full year. And I think the original plan for the cumulative CapEx through 2022 was about $475 million. Just curious whether you're seeing efficiency there if that's just some timing?\nCarl Anderson: Good morning Itay. It's more timing. For the first six months, we had about $25 million of CapEx. We are planning for about $70 million of CapEx in the last six months of the year. So part of it was production came back pretty quickly as you recall in our first fiscal quarter. And I think some of the programs we are just beginning to ramp back up here this quarter as well as in the fourth quarter for us.\nItay Michaeli: Great. That's helpful color. And just -- I think you addressed it to the prior questions, but just as we think about that bridge from the second half margins to the 2022 target, I think you mentioned some of the recoveries on steel. But can you just maybe walk us through some of the bigger puts and takes in terms of what -- at least some of the headwinds that you're facing today that are contractually going to reverse next year particularly on the other steel side?\nChris Villavarayan: Yeah. Itay, the biggest thing we're seeing when you really boil it down is really on steel. So as I referenced that $25 million to $30 million headwind is really a second-half story for us. So while freight costs what we've talked about are -- have increased and are elevated from what they have been historically our material performance and some of our operational performance items have been able to offset that. So the true story is steel. And if you were to simply adjust for this deal of $25 million to $30 million; our margins would be very similar to what they are here in the first and second quarter.\nItay Michaeli: Got it. Perfect. That\u2019s real helpful. Thanks.\nChris Villavarayan: Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. And I'll turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo.\nTodd Chirillo: Great. Thank you, and thank you everyone for joining our call today. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to slide three. We had strong results this quarter, with $983 million in sales and adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3%. Total company sales were up 13% year-over-year, as truck demand increased in all our global markets. Free cash flow performance was excellent this quarter, coming in at $47 million. This was one of our highest second quarter cash flows since we began the implants in 2013. Once again, the Meritor team demonstrated its ability to successfully respond to markets. Even with the sharp increase in volumes and supply chain challenges, we maintain excellent delivery and quality performance for our customers, while converting increased sales to profits at expected levels. Looking at the full fiscal year, we're holding our sales, margin and cash flow guidance, despite indications that we will have one of the largest unfavorable steel impacts we have seen, in addition to higher expense in electric powertrain development, as we ramp up production capabilities to meet the increasing demand. Carl will provide more detail, but our ability to offset these headwinds reflects the consistent strong execution you expect from us. We have a brand-new electrification program to announce this quarter, in addition to an exciting new opportunity to accelerate development of our 17Xe electric powertrain in Europe. And in our core business, we have recently finalized long-term agreements with two global OE customers. Please move to slide four. In the second quarter, we extended our agreement with Navistar through 2026. We are pleased to continue our long-standing relationship with Navistar, as it becomes part of the Traton family. This agreement extends our current relationship, while providing opportunity for future growth in our major product categories of axles, brakes and drivelines. We also completed a new agreement with IVECO in Europe through 2024. This includes the supply of single reduction axles and strengthens our successful business relationship between our companies. It also provides the opportunity for future growth on other product lines. With Navistar and IVECO complete, most of our long-term agreements with major customers have been renewed well past the 2022 time frame. Moving to electrification on slide 5. We are pleased to announce a new collaboration with Hexagon Purus Systems, a global leader in zero emission e-mobility. Hexagon will integrate Meritor's 14Xe powertrain into its Class 6, Class 7 box trucks and Class 8 6x4 vehicles starting 2021. Customers, including PACCAR, AutoCar, line electric Volta trucks and Hexagon have chosen Meritor's 14Xe integrated electric powertrain. We believe this is market validation of its industry-leading performance. In early 2020, we announced an agreement with PACCAR to be the initial launch partner and supplier for the integration of the fully functional battery electric systems on the Kenworth T680 and Peterbilt 579 and 520 electric vehicles. We have begun prototype production and PACCAR is performing validation testing on its test tracks. It's very exciting for us to see these fully electric vehicles being assembled. Soon these and many others with Meritor's preferred electric powertrain solutions will be fully operational on roads and highways. Please take a minute to view a video of this truck in motion on meritor.com. This footage was shot last week, at our Escondido California facility. With market adoption growing for our 14Xe, we're now shifting the focus to the development of the 17Xe platform in Europe. Last month, we learnt we were a grant recipient of the advanced propulsion center in the United Kingdom. This grant will partially fund the development of Meritor 17Xe. After a comprehensive months-long nomination and consideration process, we were thrilled to be selected along with our consortium partners Danfoss Editron and Electra Commercial Vehicles. This grant totaling almost \u00a316 million will rapidly accelerate development of this product, that is designed for multiple vehicle platforms and extend our ability to offer Meritor's e-powertrain solutions for the European market. We believe demand for this product will grow because of the EU 2025 CO2 reduction targets. Stricter targets will start applying in 2030 and by 2040 all new trucks sold in Europe will need to be fossil-free to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The 17Xe is another significant step towards completing our electric powertrain portfolio. Carl, will now provide details on our financial results. Thanks, Carl. Let's turn to slide 9. While it is difficult to schedule events with certainty, we're planning to hold our Analyst Day in person this year in New York. More details will be provided in the coming months. At that time we will present M2025. We will move of course -- we will of course closely monitor the situation as we move closer to this date to ensure we can meet safely. Before we close I would like to express our concern for the serious situation occurring in India as the pandemic worsens. Our team in the region has taken actions to help employees and the community through care centers, vaccination and mobile testing facilities and we plan to do more. Our thoughts are with our colleagues and their families during this crisis. Again, I want to thank you for joining us today to review Meritor's second quarter results and welcome any questions you may have at this time. Good morning, James. For sure, James. I'll take that. So when you think about it it's beyond the last three months. If you look at it it's the last six months. Order intake has come in at 40 or above 40. And to your point, backlogs are passing I think, I believe 300,000. And for our fiscal year right now the midpoint with the recent change is -- it's 285000 for the fiscal between ACT and FTR. And if you look at the midpoint for next year for the heavy market, it's at about 340. So to your point great highs and you got to believe the Texas storms resolved, as well as the fire in Japan. So the chip shortage will get resolved here shortly or will improve shortly. We do believe there is impact through the next couple of quarters, but it eventually should improve. So again we believe there's a strong 2022 ahead of us as well. Well, I think it's -- Joe to that point, it's 15% definitely through 2022. I think once you start getting past 2022 you got to 2023 and 2024; it could begin to moderately step up. So, you're probably not too far off with that assumption. Thank you. Absolutely. So, let me start with the first question specific to labor. It's a red hot market out there as you could see with the first question. There's significant drive and demand for the product. And I think it's running right through the economy GDPB being strong and consumer spending. So, in essence, we were able to drive that -- some of that recovery is specific to that with some of our customers. However, on top of that, it's really about operational performance. It's driving incremental operational performance whether it's labor and burden in how we look at our lines or whether it's how we look at material opportunities. So, that's how we drive that savings to offset labor. Specific to freight, we're seeing about three times more freight in terms of cost to your point whether it's on ocean or internal as well. And for those elements what we are again doing is trying to offset a lot of that with -- sorry with material performance and operational performance. But on top of that we also look at working with our customers as well. Good morning Matt. Thank you. Yeah. Itay, the biggest thing we're seeing when you really boil it down is really on steel. So as I referenced that $25 million to $30 million headwind is really a second-half story for us. So while freight costs what we've talked about are -- have increased and are elevated from what they have been historically our material performance and some of our operational performance items have been able to offset that. So the true story is steel. And if you were to simply adjust for this deal of $25 million to $30 million; our margins would be very similar to what they are here in the first and second quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Carl Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our second quarter financial results and provide an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. As Chris mentioned at the beginning of the call, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.3%, and we generated $47 million of free cash flow. Now, let's review our financial results compared to the prior year on slide 6. Before I continue, I want to highlight a revision we are making to our presentation of two non-GAAP measures, adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share. To better align with SEC guidance, we will no longer include in non-GAAP measures the adjustment for non-cash tax expense related to the use of deferred tax assets in jurisdictions with net operating loss carryforwards or tax credits. It is important to note, this is a change to our reporting metrics only as the underlying availability and benefit of tax attributes to offset future taxable income has not changed. We expect to maintain an effective cash tax rate of approximately 15% through the M2022 planning cycle. In the appendix, we have also updated prior periods to reflect this change providing for consistent comparatives. Now let's review the details of our financial results. Beginning with the total company, revenue came in at $983 million, up $112 million from the same period last year. As economies rebounded globally, we saw increased truck production in all of our markets. Net income from continuing operations was $63 million, compared to $240 million last year. As a reminder, prior year results include $203 million of after-tax income related to the termination of the distribution arrangement we had with WABCO. This was partially offset by the recognition of value-added tax credits in our wholly owned Brazilian entity of $22 million or $15 million net of tax during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $111 million, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3%, a decrease of 100 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA this quarter excludes the $22 million Brazil value-added tax credit I previously mentioned. The decrease in margin was primarily driven by an approximately $20 million impact from incentive compensation cost compared to the prior period. Keep in mind, last year we significantly reduced our incentive compensation accrual at the onset of the pandemic. Additionally, we experienced higher freight costs as compared to a year ago. This higher expense was offset by cost reduction actions executed in the second half of last year. Overall, we were pleased with our margin performance, especially given some of these cost headwinds. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.68, up $0.04 from last year. And free cash flow for the quarter was very strong at $47 million. Last year we generated $292 million of free cash flow, which included $265 million related to our distribution agreement termination. If you adjust for the one-time impact from last year, free cash flow improved $20 million year-over-year. Based on our market outlook and expectations on cash flow generation going forward, we are in a position to return to a more normalized level of cash on our balance sheet. We therefore are announcing the redemption of the remaining 6.25% notes due in 2024. The $175 million principal balance will be redeemed at the call price of just over 101%, utilizing available cash on hand, which was $321 million at the end of the second quarter. Our objective of maintaining BB credit metrics through market cycles was reinforced this past year, as we were able to successfully manage through the onset of the pandemic. Upon completion of the debt repurchase, our gross debt balances will be similar to where we were pre-COVID. We were also on track for net leverage to be approximately two times this year and plan for a further step down in 2022. Now let's look at our segment results compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck increased by 23%, driven by higher global truck production in all markets. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $73 million, up $15 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 9.4%, an increase of 20 basis points over the prior year. The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue and by cost reductions actions executed last year. This was partially offset by higher incentive compensation and freight costs. Aftermarket and industrial sales were $247 million in the second quarter, down $30 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by the termination of our distribution arrangement, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.  Segment adjusted EBITDA was down $12 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 and segment adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 13.8%. The decreases were driven primarily by the impact from the termination of our distribution arrangement and increased incentive compensation costs, partially offset by cost reduction actions.  Before I review our current global market outlook on slide 7, I want to provide an update on supply chain constraints in the markets we are closely monitoring. Global supply chains, primarily for semiconductors have become constrained during this global production upturn. This has affected many global manufacturing industries including commercial trucks. We are seeing some impact to production schedules as a result.  In India, the current wave of the pandemic is having a significant impact on the country, which could affect the ability of our OE customers and suppliers to manufacture in the short run. Demand however, remains high in all of our markets. In particular, order activity in the North America Class 8 market continues to be robust averaging over 40,000 units per month in our fiscal second quarter and cancellation rates remain very low.  Overall, as we assess all of the pluses and minuses, we are keeping our global production outlook unchanged as we balance strong global demand with potential supply chain constraints.  Let's turn to slide 8 for an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Consistent with our market assumptions, we are holding forecasted sales to be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.8 billion unchanged from our prior forecast. We are also maintaining our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance steady at an expected range of 10.6% to 10.8%. We are however seeing steel costs continue to increase. Since September hot-rolled coil prices have increased more than 130% and scrap prices are up nearly 100%.  The price movement in steel has been the most severe and rapid increase we have seen over the past 10 years. As a result, we now anticipate a full year headwind of $25 million to $30 million in higher steel costs up $10 million from our prior review. Most of this impact will be felt in our third fiscal quarter as prices begin to reset with our steel suppliers.  While this is a significant headwind in 2021, we do a pass-through mechanism in place with our customers, which are typically on a three- to six-month lag. We expect to see most of this recovery beginning in early fiscal year in 2022.  Additionally, we are increasing our electrification spend between $5 million to $10 million from our prior guidance as we continue to respond to this growing opportunity. While we are experiencing these higher costs, we expect to be able to offset most of these increases through continued operational performance. Our purchasing team has done an excellent job in driving material performance savings and we continue to see the benefits from cost reduction actions executed last year.  Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is now in the range of $2.15 to $2.30. This reflects the impact from the adjustment for non-cash taxes as well as the lower interest expense expected from the bond redemption. Our effective cash tax rate of approximately 15% in fiscal 2021 remains unchanged.  And finally, we are maintaining our expectation to generate between $110 million to $125 million of free cash flow. Overall, the team is doing a fantastic job, managing through the challenges of the strong global rebound and deliver a solid glide path to M2022.  Now I will turn the call back over to Chris. Sure. James, it's Carl. As it relates to steel prices, which is the really primary driver for us we do expect it to be year-over-year about $25 million to $30 million headwind in fiscal 2021. So if you think about the recovery mechanisms as that begins to kind of flow through that will come through really beginning in fiscal -- the first part of fiscal 2022. And so of that we would expect to be recovering around probably $20 million of that number as we go forward. Yes, James, it was really just driven by a couple of factors. One was, we did see some higher freight costs in the second quarter, as well as a little bit higher cost from steel that affected the aftermarket business. Thank you. I think that's the right way to think about it Joe. If you look at the six months EBITDA margin performance to-date, we're right around 11.4%. So if you think what our guide is of 10.6% to 10.8% that does imply the second half margins will be about 10% on roughly the same type of revenue. Absolutely Joe, but I'll start with the first question. First, I think, glad to see the backlog continuing to grow. As you remember, we talked about having this $500 million target for electrification as our revenue pipeline. We accomplished $400 million of that with the -- at the last quarter. And so with this announcement with Hexagon, we've taken a chunk of that. So we continue to see the growth. And to put it in perspective of spend, if you go back to 2019, we spent about $12 million. Last year we spent $21 million, and this year we're moving it up to $35 million to $40 million. So we're almost doubling it per year, and it's primarily because of the wins and it's essentially application and testing of our products as it wins with more customers. To your second question, the ability to attach components, absolutely, we do see a path with brakes -- as primarily with brakes with many of the customers as an opportunity to grow business as well. It is on, let's call it, everybody that is, let's call it, new entrants coming into the market. So when you think about the new entrants, we have a significant share of the existing traditional business. So it is on the new business, but you also have to take into account when you think about electrification always remember it's five times and up to five times content on a 14Xe, for example. So, we're already seeing that growth as well. Yes, it is. Yes. And to add to what Chris said, as we look at just overall freight costs in our first quarter, we did experience probably higher premium costs associated with the rapid increase in production that we saw in the first quarter. But the -- what we're seeing is kind of just the basic run rate with cost today is all factored into our guidance. Absolutely. So, the industrial specialty and off-highway markets are incredibly important for us. This is why we did the AxleTech and Fabco acquisitions two years ago. And so we are seeing the fruits of those acquisitions as we think through 2022 and our -- as we look at our revenue pipeline growth. When we think about the core business and as we have talked about exceeding our revenue targets for 2022, a lot of it is coming in our industrial Defense & Specialty business and a lot of it is driven by this. So we are seeing that growth. Again last quarter we talked about developing an independent suspension for this market. And it is going into production this year and it will be in run-rate next year. And then second is we're also developing a similar system on the electric side. So we're looking at an electric platform that requires to accomplish us the same thing as well for the RV space. Sure. I think when we -- at this point, we are working with customers that we have agreements in certain regions. And as you could imagine, they are hard agreements and they take a while to work through. And it's a discussion that we are working through and we are seeing the benefits in some areas. Good morning Itay. It's more timing. For the first six months, we had about $25 million of CapEx. We are planning for about $70 million of CapEx in the last six months of the year. So part of it was production came back pretty quickly as you recall in our first fiscal quarter. And I think some of the programs we are just beginning to ramp back up here this quarter as well as in the fourth quarter for us."

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Meritor's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call. On the call today, we have Jay Craig, CEO and President; Chris Villavarayan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Carl Anderson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; all of whom will be available for questions following the call.

Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 3. As you can see from our results this quarter, we're off to a tremendous start for the year. I want to thank Meritor employees for the excellent performance. Regardless of the environment, this team exceeds expectations, as demonstrated last year, and right out of the gate, in fiscal 2021. Our Class 8 truck orders from North America, our largest market, rose to the fourth and fifth highest months in history, in November and December. We executed it exceedingly well, as you will hear from Chris and Carl. In fact, with truck volumes materially rising in almost all our end markets, we are raising our full year outlook significantly.  Since 2021 rebound provides us with increased confidence and a clear path to 2022 objectives, particularly because we believe that some of this year's headwinds, will become tailwinds next year, as we complete our current M-plans. At the same time, we're investing in the revolutionary technologies we are bringing to market. These technologies will give commercial vehicle OEMS, optimal solutions to meet regional CO2 reduction targets, and will also provide a host of other benefits.  At this point, I will turn the call over to Chris, for highlights for the quarter, and come back later for closing comments. \nChris Villavarayan: Thanks, Jake. We're obviously pleased with our results this quarter. On revenue that was essentially flat year-over -year, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 60 basis points higher than the same period last year, and free cash flow was up significantly. Carl will give you more details on the financials in just a moment, but the primary takeaway is that we're optimistic about the demand for commercial vehicles throughout the remainder of fiscal 2021.  We expect significantly higher volumes than most markets, as most economies deploy fiscal and monetary stimuli, the vaccine rollout gains momentum, and the demand for goods increases, particularly in North America. On the right half of this slide, we highlight business wins this quarter. You will remember that last November, we said we expected to exceed our M2022 new business target of 300 million. We're going to talk about some of those contracts that are driving that outperformance in our truck and industrial businesses, as well as production awards for our electric powertrain.  Moving to Slide 4, you will see a few examples of customers with whom we have recently secured new business on a variety of applications. In India, we have additional axle contracts with Ashok Leyland and Daimler India, for medium and heavy duty vehicle. We now have standard position with Terex for front and rear drive axles and brakes on concrete mixers. We will supply an existing customer with independent front suspensions for recreational vehicles, and we have entered a new three-year LTA with John Deere for 100% of its applicator axles. Transitioning to electrification, Slide 5 gives you a look at additional contracts we\u2019ve secured for our ePowertrain. As mentioned last quarter, we believe we'll be the first supplier to manufacture electric ePowertrains for Class 8 trucks. These new contracts reflect the application flexibility we\u2019ve designed into our electric powertrain portfolio, and the growing demand for Meritor\u2019s solution. The ePowertrain is an integrated product, engineered to allow for a variety of subsystems, including axle, transmission, motors, wheel ends, and brakes, to function as one efficient system.  We have entered into a five-year agreement to supply Meritor\u2019s 14Xe electric powertrains for Autocar\u2019s refuse vehicle. With Lion Electric, a Canadian manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles, we signed a three-year agreement to supply our heavy duty tandem electric powertrain for Lion\u2019s AT tractor. And we\u2019ve also secured a three-year contract with Volta Trucks in London. Meritor\u2019s 14Xe will be equipped on the Volta Zero, a full land 16-tonne commercial vehicle designed for inner city parcel and freight distribution. We expect revenues from all these contracts to ramp up in 2023. With the industry recognition we have already received for this product, the growing number of production contracts, we are highly confident that Meritor\u2019s electric powertrain represents game-changing technology for commercial vehicles.  Carl will now provide more detail on our financial results.\nCarl Anderson: Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our first quarter financial results, discuss the upturn we are seeing in most of our global markets, and provide an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Overall, as you heard from Chris, we delivered strong financial performance in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5%, and we generated $34 million of free cash flow.  Now, let me provide the details of our financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 6. Beginning with total company results, revenue came in at $889 million, roughly flat from the same period last year. Net income from continuing operations was $32 million, compared to $39 million in the prior year. Lower net income was primarily the result of higher interest expense, which included $8 million of debt extinguishment costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. This was partially offset by cost reduction actions executed in the second half of last year.  Additionally, joint venture earnings increased $5 million from a year ago. This was driven primarily from a $6 million one-time gain recognized from our joint venture in Brazil relating to a value added tax credit. Overall, this drove adjusted EBITDA of $102 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2021, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%, a 50 basis point increase from the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.60, down slightly from $0.64 last year. And free cash flow improved by $69 million from a year ago, as we saw a tailwind from our back stream programs, and we had $32 million in lower incentive compensation payments in the quarter. Now, let's look at our segment results compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck increased by 4% to $691 million. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by slightly higher market bounds in Europe and India. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $63 million, up $6 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 9.1%, an increase of 50 basis points over the prior year.  The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue, cost reduction actions executed last year, and higher joint venture earnings. This was partially offset by higher freight premiums, and a $6 million increase in electrification spend, as compared to last year. Aftermarket industrial sales were $234 million in the first quarter, down $41 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As we saw last quarter, even with lower revenue, segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points to 15%. The increase was driven by cost reduction actions executed last year, which more than offset the impact from lower revenue.  I'll review our current global market outlook on Slide 7. In the North America Class 8 market, we are now projecting production levels between 270,000 to 290,000 units, a nearly 20% increase at the midpoint from our prior outlook. We have seen a full quarter of strong order intakes, including two months of orders greater than 50,000 units. And just last night, January preliminary orders came in at over 42,000 units. This aligns with the strong production forecast we are seeing from our customers, all pointing to a significant production recovery in 2021. Turning to Europe, we're also seeing a steady increase in this market. We now forecast production will be in the range of 360,000 to 380,000 units. South America is another market where we are experiencing a strong rebound. We are now forecasting production to be in the range of 135,000 to 145,000 units, almost a 50% increase at the mid-point from our prior outlook. At these levels, it would be the strongest Class 8 production year since 2014. And in India, we are maintaining our previous forecast of 230,000 to 250,000 units. Keep in mind, this still represents an increase of approximately 80% year-over -year from historically low volumes in 2020. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 for an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Given the market assumptions we just reviewed, we are now forecasting sales to be in the range of 3.65 billion to 3.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 10.6% to 10.8%, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance. With the upturn, we are encountering several headwinds which will impact earnings conversions as we move through 2021. Increasing demand across the global economy is driving significant increases in steel, our largest material cost.  While we have cost recovery mechanisms in place with most of our OE customers, they generally are on a three to six month lag. As a result, we are currently seeing $15 million to $20 million in higher steel costs in fiscal 2021, due to the timing impact of these cost recovery mechanisms. Additionally, at the significantly higher market levels, we are anticipating higher incentive compensation costs of approximately $15 million. With these headwinds, we now anticipate earnings conversion of approximately 19% on incremental revenue, compared to last year. Overall, if you were to adjust for these two items, our conversion on the incremental revenue would be around 22 to 23%, more in line with our expectations. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is now the range of $2.25 and $2.50. And finally, we expect to generate $110 million to $125 million of free cash flow.  On Slide 9, I want to provide an update to our path for achieving the company's M2022 margin target of 12.5%. As we have seen in prior M-plans, the steps for achieving our targets may change, but we typically are able to adjust to the current operating environment and deliver on our targets. The 12.5% margin target is no exception. As we discussed on the previous slide, we are seeing increased costs related to both steel and incentive compensation in 2021. Next year, we do expect these costs to normalize, providing a 60 to 80 basis point tailwind. We also anticipate converting on incremental volume and new business wins at greater than 20%.  Additionally, as we announced last quarter, we are in the process of executing a footprint optimization plan, which will result in the consolidation of four locations into existing facilities. This will provide an additional tailwind of $12 million to $15 million, as $5 million of cost to execute the consolidation in 2021, will be behind us, and approximately $7 million to $10 million of savings from the smaller footprint, will be realized. The conversion on increased revenue and the footprint optimization, are expected to provide an additional 90 to 130 basis points of incremental margin next year. Overall, the path to achieving our 12.5% margin target remains clear.  Before I turn the call back over to Jay, I want to take a moment to express my deepest appreciation for his extraordinary leadership he's shown through his many years at Meritor. On both a personal and professional level, I wish Jay all the best, and look forward to working with him in his new role. Now, I will turn the call over to Jay for final remarks. \nJay Craig: Thanks, Carl. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 10. With this being my last call with you, I wanted to make a few comments before we go to questions. My first earnings call with Meritor was in the second quarter of 2008, and except for a few quarters in 2013, and \u201814, when I was running the business, I have not missed one. So, I guess that puts me somewhere close to 50 calls. While in charge and all CEOs and CFOs look forward to them, I can honestly say, I always did. Our investors and analysts, many of whom have been with us a long time, always drove us to be better, and challenged us to look at the business from different perspectives. Your insight, comments, and questions, contributed to the successful transformation of the company over the past several years. As I transition to the role of Executive Chairman, I have full confidence in Chris's ability and that of his leadership team, to maintain the trajectory of high performance that we have demonstrated for quite a long time now. Growing our base business, expanding our electrification capabilities, and maintaining excellent levels of operating performance, will continue to be the highest priority, as we remain focused on returning value to shareholders. As we near the successful completion of our third M-plan, we recognize the discipline and execution that it took to become the company we are today, and we'll proceed with the same diligence. For this, I want to thank all our employees around the globe that have helped us achieve the enormous stretch targets we have set for ourselves. I will miss working day to day with such a diverse, talented and driven team.  I also want to thank our Board of Directors for their support and guidance. We have a strong board with a diverse set of strengths, that has played an important role in the company's journey. I look forward to continuing to work with them as Executive Chairman. I wish all of you my best in the future. And with that, we will take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from the line of James Picariello with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJames Picariello: Hey, good morning guys. And Jay, congratulations again on your retirement. It's been a pleasure. Within your FY\u201921 guidance here, can you just talk about what the implied incrementals are, what the additional EV related spend might be? And then, Carl, you did mention color on incrementals to FY\u201922. I mean, can you just talk about those incrementals, how we get to that targeted 12.5% for FY\u201922 within that framework? Thanks.\nCarl Anderson: Good morning, James. Yes, as it relates to fiscal \u201921, as I referenced, we do expect all in, to have about 19% conversion on the incremental revenue that we're seeing. We are faced with a couple of headwinds, and I referenced both steel and incentive compensation, but with - and as it relates to electrification. In the quarter, we did at $6 million of higher electrification spend compared to a year ago. We are also probably tracking closer to the $30 million of electrification expense within fiscal year \u201821 as well. So overall, as we look forward, we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver and get close to that 20% kind of incremental margins for fiscal 21, but more importantly, it really is - as I laid out, we're definitely on track to deliver on our \u201822 target.\nJames Picariello: Got it. The 30 million electrification spend, that's cumulative, right? That would be like an incremental $10 million or so, is that right?\nCarl Anderson: Yes. It's about 7 million to 8 million higher than we did a year ago.\nJames Picariello: Got it. And then can you just - I mean, maybe I just missed this, but can you provide an update on what the number is in terms of EV awards that are booked, and then what the - is the pipeline potential, that 200 million, has that changed at all? And just maybe talk about what the latest two - the last two awards, what is a highly competitive process. Thanks.\nChris Villavarayan: James, it's Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that question. So what we talked about is a line of sight for $500 million, of which, with the announcements we've made today with booked business to $400 million. And we still have our line of sight for the last $100 million to the targets that we had provided earlier. And then talking about the three agreements that we announced today with Lion Electric Volta, and Autocar, that accounts for a total of $200 million of booked up business in total. We're not breaking that out by year.\nJames Picariello: Understood. Thanks guys. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nRyan Brinkman: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Can you hear me?\nJay Craig: Yes, we can.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay, great. Thanks. Given the mention on Slide 4 of exposure to the RV market via front suspensions and the record wholesale shipment numbers that have been coming out of the recreational vehicle industry association lately, I just wanted to ask about what your revenue exposure is to this area, what kind of growth you might be seeing. Are you primarily benefiting from the increase in industry volumes, or are you also in any way incrementally targeting that market with new products, et cetera? And also since you last reported earnings, I think we heard the very first announcements relative to the potential for electrification in the RV space, which came from Lordstown Motors and Camping World in December. Do you have any thoughts on electrification in this corner of the market and what role that Meritor could potentially play?\nChris Villavarayan: Sure. Ryan, it\u2019s Chris Villavarayan. I'll start the question and then maybe hand it over to Carl to just provide some of the financials. But very quickly, with the acquisition of AxleTech, obviously this has been a very important market. And so, as part of M2022, we also had a strategy to grow in this market. And so, what we're doing is exactly executing on that strategy. The new win is part of a growth strategy and is not associated with the current market growth. So we had a plan to grow this business, and that's exactly what we're doing.  Specific to electrification, we are looking at, let's call it independent suspensions with Wieland Motors, but that is something that we're exploring a little bit further. With that, I'm going to turn it to Carl.\nCarl Anderson: Ryan, that business kind of resides in our industrial segment. And if I look at what we're seeing in that, especially entering into \u201821 in total, we do now see our industrial business up on a high single digit percent on a year-over-year basis at this point.\nRyan Brinkman: Okay. Very good. Thank you. And then just last question, relative to the electrification opportunities that were identified on Slide 5, I'm curious if the potential pipeline has maybe grown. And I'd be interested too, if you have any thoughts on GM's new BrightDrop plans, and whether that automaker\u2019s relatively greater vertical integration of electrified drive line components in the light vehicle side, might or might not translate into similar vertical integration on the commercial vehicle side. Also, just what you're seeing generally in terms of the latest developments with regard to commercial vehicle manufacturers\u2019 plans to either insource or outsource the types of electrification components that you're able to provide.\nChris Villavarayan: Well, I'll take that question, Ryan. Just maybe first perspective, from a broad spectrum, when we look at the three customer awards that we presented today, Autocar, a nameplate that's been around for 125 - 123 years. And then if you look at Volta, it's a brand new entrant, and Lion\u2019s been in the market for about 10 years. So it's great to see that from a broad spectrum of customers, they see the value in Meritor\u2019s product. Now, specific to where we see this growth, we do see - the first thing that we're focused on is obviously completing our pipeline. And to that point, we\u2019re testing with a multitude of OEs right now around the globe. So hopefully we can talk about more wins here, but right now, we're targeting - targeted on closing out on our $500 million book of business that we talk about. Specific to the GM, and let's call it the skateboard, I think when you look at - the best part about it is, in terms of whether you look at OEs integrating this, the best part of electrification is in any sense, I think what it does is, it drives competition, and it will speed us faster towards sustainable energy. And in any sense, as we look at the real estate we have, it just means more content for us, no matter what happens. And in that sense, our perspective is that as long as we're in this space, this will continue to grow for us. \nJay Craig: Yes. And I\u2019d say, Ryan - this is Jay. One last comment. There\u2019s always been a significant difference between the commercial vehicle and the light vehicle OEs and the level of vertical integration of components. So we've obviously had a significant share of the drive train market across the EV industry, and we expect that to continue into the future, based on the discussions that we're having so far moving to electrification.\nRyan Brinkman: Very helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Spak: Thank you very much, and wanted to echo my congratulations to Jay again, and then obviously the rest of the team. Back on electrification, a couple of questions here. You mentioned a bunch of these startups. There\u2019s obviously a lot more we've seen trying to come to market than on this page. Like how - can you just talk to us a little bit about how you approach the opportunity? Because obviously, they\u2019re sort of all incremental, but it does require you guys to commit resources and capital and the exact path of some of these ventures is maybe a little bit unclear. So how do you think - you almost have to be a little bit of a VC in that respect, right? So how do you think about sort of approaching the opportunity with some of these startups?\nChris Villavarayan: So, Joe, I'll take that question. And I think the perspective that we use, if we look at the Class 8, let's call it the medium and the heavy duty Class 8 market, and we look at, what is the percentage of electrification, and we aim for that, or a percentage - a fair share of that. And in essence, work with every OE that is approaching that space and provide our product. But in overall in how we capacitize, we're looking at what we believe will be the model of what roles will be there in electrification as a percentage of the overall market.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. So it's not necessarily - you don't necessarily view it as sort of like a bet on any one of these individual companies, because the product is somewhat fungible between them?\nChris Villavarayan: Yes. I think, Joe, to that point, I think it\u2019s - for us, it\u2019s more about the product as far as all the development, all of the testing that we have done and kind of how that stands. And I do think, as we think about how that fits in with whether a couple of the startups with existing customers and obviously the large OE customers we have today, that is kind of the focus. And we do believe our product is a differentiator, and that will - is really kind of the path to market for us across all of these potential opportunities.\nJoseph Spak: Okay. So, maybe then just to follow up, or two quick follow ups on that. Like, one, can you talk about the range of activities on electrification, like from - like either whole e-axles or components and how that might vary with different potential customers? And I guess also, we touched a little bit on the EV spend, but it seems like that might need to continue to sort of move higher, especially if the new wins continue to move higher. So, wanted to get some thoughts on that and when you might sort of get to a breakeven, or sort of self-funding level on the investment,\nJay Craig: Well, let me start off. And just following on Carl's comments, if you look at the three announcements today, they're all based off the 14Xe powertrain. So it's the perfect example of using the same product and making - as you called it, fungible across the three OEs. So that's one perspective that we're using. On top of that, when we - the announcement we made with PACCAR, the last one for a full EV kit, that includes the PCARs, the battery system, as well as the electric powertrain, or the 14Xe tandem. With that, I'll turn it over to Carl.\nCarl Anderson: Yes, Joe, as we look at it, we're not chasing all the various startups. We\u2019re really just focused on what's fitting our product portfolio. So that's kind of one of the first lens that we look through. And as Chris just discussed, we are - we both have the kit side, as well as the 14Xe and the axle side, and 17Xe in the future. And as we look forward, our expectation is, when it kind of flips to profitability, it\u2019s probably outside the \u201822 time horizon, but as we see it now, that that can come potentially as early as in 2023, depending on what we're seeing in the market at that time. \nJoseph Spak: Okay. Maybe I could just sneak one more. I thought I heard you mentioned some additional optimization and restructuring. I\u2019m just curious if you could provide a little bit more details on that because, right, the team - you guys mentioned sort of early on, it seems like the markets are moving in your favor, sort of going more up than down. So I just wanted to better understand that.\nChris Villavarayan: Yes. So nothing was new. This was just - we didn't talk about this last quarter as well. So we just helped to try to frame what the impact we will see in \u201822 as a result from these optimization plans. So in total, we are expecting, as you kind of compare \u201822 to \u201821, it's probably somewhere about $13 million to $15 million of tailwind, if we think about EBITDA as we enter \u201922, once we're fully are - complete these facility closures. \nJoseph Spak: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. And our next question does come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBrian Johnson: Good morning, and want to echo congratulations to Jay, who I'm sure will still be helpful on the strategic direction. I think I've been at probably 95% of those calls since then. So in terms of the 14Xe and these interesting wins, just when I thought I knew every electric bus and truck company out there, you find another one. But the question is, can you just remind - a few things. One, just remind us of the content opportunity, obviously not your price list. But if you think about an electric urban truck like Volta is talking about, with the 14Xe axle versus if you did one for one of your traditional OEMs, the type of content you might have.\nJay Craig: Sure. Brian, I'll take that. And first of all, Brian, it's about five times in terms of content of our traditional vehicle platform. \nBrian Johnson: And then, we\u2019re certainly well aware of Dana, the competitor sort of in that space, then they focus more on medium duty. A question we get though is, given Cummins, EDEN, Allison, are also very important Class 5 to 7 and Class 8 suppliers, how do your - what do you see from those powertrain buyers coming over into the electric truck and bus marketplace?\nJay Craig: Well, I think, the one thing is, as I look at it, and as I mentioned that competition and obviously is something that will make us all better and drive towards electrification and drive the products to be better across the whole spectrum. But specific to our products, I think the one great thing is, we're going to be first to production here in the summer of this year. We have over 100 vehicles on path.  And in that sense, if you look at our product, I think the best part about it is the fact that it's fully integrated. You have a motor integrated with an axle, integrated with the wheel end, and that\u2019s - the sense of what we're putting together, that's only about 100 to 150 pounds heavier than a standard axle. So if you put that in perspective, you're removing an engine and a transmission and shrink - then shrinking it into that space.\nBrian Johnson: Right. And given the high margins we've seen in the transmission space, one way to think about is you're basically taking both engine and transmission content and margin, and bringing it over to Meritor. Is that a fair generalization?\nChris Villavarayan: Well, that\u2019s - as you said, maybe the best way to answer that, Brian, is we \u2026\nCarl Anderson: Yes, I think, Brian, I would say, over the last six years, we've seen that margin move up, not only cost reductions, but from all the new products we've introduced, taken out the traditional side. And I would say, our expectations for the electric products are no different. We\u2019ll be introducing products we think have more concepts and higher margin.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. And then kind of a follow on question, which is kind of, as you look at these specs and the new entrants, most of them are kind of pre-revenue. How do you - I know you sort of answered this question earlier, how do you get comfortable that it's actually worth your time? And I guess the second one is, with some of the larger fleet and larger Class 8 manufacturers, how would you - if someone doesn't go with a startup truck operator, but wants to go with a player provider, how are you positioned there?\nJay Craig: Well, again, I think we're focused on the product, and let's call it the weight class. So when we come in, we're looking at it as, what does the 14Xe powertrain cover? And we think about it as the Class 8 line hall space, or just down to a medium duty, the top end of a Class 7 space. And we're taking a product and positioning it where it can go across, whether it's to a new entrant, or to a company that's been well entrenched and a customer of Meritor for many, many years. So - and there's perfect examples of both ends of that spectrum, even in our announcements in the last two quarters, whether it's Autocar and PACCAR on one side, or Lion and Volta on the other side.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. And final question. You didn't have your trademark analyst day at a hotel this year. But we are both coming up on the successor to Meritor \u201822, as well as starts to kind of kicking the tires again, so to speak, or the axles, on some of your products - e-products, is going to be interesting. Do you have any thoughts about an event later in the year that would bring those two important things together?\nChris Villavarayan: We do, Brian. And I think, just as you have experienced with Jay, we've in essence, always done - started preparing for the release of it a year in advance. And so, we're in the process of developing our M2025 strategy. And ideally, we'd like to have it with all of you in-person, probably at the end of the year or worst case, let's call it at the beginning of next year. But that's our goal right now, is to drive for the end of this year.\nBrian Johnson: Okay. Thank you. Look forward to that.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nItay Michaeli: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just two follow-up financial questions, first on the M2022 revenue target that you expect to exceed. Hoping you can just update us, remind us of the latest end market assumptions, particularly relative to the original end market assumptions behind the $4 billion of revenue target. And then secondly, just on free cash flow conversion, I think last quarter, you were still talking about 75%. Just curious if there's any change to next year's free cash conversion outlook.\nCarl Anderson: Okay. Good morning, Itay. As it relates to - maybe I\u2019ll answer the free cash flow first, yes, no change in our planning assumptions for \u201922. We still expect to drive and achieve the 75% free cash flow conversion. I think in the short term, in \u201821, I think every cash flow is cutting a high 50% - just about 70% as we are expanding a little bit of our CapEx spend this year by about $10 million, which is one of the drivers to that. As relating to the end market assumptions, we're not updating them today, but what we did say back in November, we were still planning for replacement demand market levels in North America and Europe, primarily in 2022. And it's something that, just based off the strength of the market that we're seeing here in \u201921, we will be taking a closer look at that once again as we kind of get later out this year and provide a further update as we kind of get into \u201822. \nItay Michaeli: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan: Gents, good morning, and congratulations. Maybe want to wax a little bit more philosophical here for a second. I think a lot of investors have been drawing comparisons this freight cycle with the last great cycle, which is maybe natural, except that the wavelength this time around has obviously been very compressed. And I'm wondering, as you talk to your customers on the commercial vehicle side, especially what your perception is in terms of where we are in the cycle inning-wise. And then maybe just a little bit more broadly, with the continued growth in the EV opportunity, how do you think about cyclicality in your business going forward?\nChris Villavarayan: Sure. Let me - Bruce, I'll take that question. So when - in terms of the market, obviously going back probably fall of last year, not too many of us could have predicted this return. However, as we looked at the last November, December, 40s and supplies, truck order intakes, and then with January at 42,000, in essence what we're seeing from our customers is, all of them are cautiously raising line rates up, primarily focused on three things. One is COVID. The second one is looking at the impact of the supply chains. And then the final one is also being mindful of finding folks to be able to staff up the shifts.  So - but with that, what we're seeing right now is, the backend or the mid to backend of this is, line rates are starting to come back up with most of our customers. So that's one perspective. And specific to electrification, I think it's a very fair question. I think when you think about electrification, the cyclicality should come out because of - you think about a growth that is much more muted as the growth goes through. I think we'll see far less cyclicality. So I hope that's helpful.\nBruce Chan: It is. Great. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Chirillo for any further remarks.\nTodd Chirillo: Thank you for joining Meritor\u2019s first quarter earnings call. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Jay Craig",
            "content": "Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 3. As you can see from our results this quarter, we're off to a tremendous start for the year. I want to thank Meritor employees for the excellent performance. Regardless of the environment, this team exceeds expectations, as demonstrated last year, and right out of the gate, in fiscal 2021. Our Class 8 truck orders from North America, our largest market, rose to the fourth and fifth highest months in history, in November and December. We executed it exceedingly well, as you will hear from Chris and Carl. In fact, with truck volumes materially rising in almost all our end markets, we are raising our full year outlook significantly.  Since 2021 rebound provides us with increased confidence and a clear path to 2022 objectives, particularly because we believe that some of this year's headwinds, will become tailwinds next year, as we complete our current M-plans. At the same time, we're investing in the revolutionary technologies we are bringing to market. These technologies will give commercial vehicle OEMS, optimal solutions to meet regional CO2 reduction targets, and will also provide a host of other benefits.  At this point, I will turn the call over to Chris, for highlights for the quarter, and come back later for closing comments. Thanks, Carl. Let's turn to Slide 10. With this being my last call with you, I wanted to make a few comments before we go to questions. My first earnings call with Meritor was in the second quarter of 2008, and except for a few quarters in 2013, and \u201814, when I was running the business, I have not missed one. So, I guess that puts me somewhere close to 50 calls. While in charge and all CEOs and CFOs look forward to them, I can honestly say, I always did.

We have a strong board with a diverse set of strengths, that has played an important role in the company's journey. I look forward to continuing to work with them as Executive Chairman. I wish all of you my best in the future. And with that, we will take your questions. Yes, we can. Yes. And I'd say, Ryan - this is Jay. One last comment. There's always been a significant difference between the commercial vehicle and the light vehicle OEs and the level of vertical integration of components. So we've obviously had a significant share of the drive train market across the EV industry, and we expect that to continue into the future, based on the discussions that we're having so far moving to electrification. Well, let me start off. And just following on Carl's comments, if you look at the three announcements today, they're all based off the 14Xe powertrain.

            "name": "Chris Villavarayan",
            "content": "Thanks, Jake. We're obviously pleased with our results this quarter. On revenue that was essentially flat year-over -year, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 60 basis points higher than the same period last year, and free cash flow was up significantly. Carl will give you more details on the financials in just a moment, but the primary takeaway is that we're optimistic about the demand for commercial vehicles throughout the remainder of fiscal 2021.  We expect significantly higher volumes than most markets, as most economies deploy fiscal and monetary stimuli, the vaccine rollout gains momentum, and the demand for goods increases, particularly in North America. On the right half of this slide, we highlight business wins this quarter. You will remember that last November, we said we expected to exceed our M2022 new business target of 300 million. We're going to talk about some of those contracts that are driving that outperformance in our truck and industrial businesses, as well as production awards for our electric powertrain.  Moving to Slide 4, you will see a few examples of customers with whom we have recently secured new business on a variety of applications. In India, we have additional axle contracts with Ashok Leyland and Daimler India, for medium and heavy duty vehicle. We now have standard position with Terex for front and rear drive axles and brakes on concrete mixers. We will supply an existing customer with independent front suspensions for recreational vehicles, and we have entered a new three-year LTA with John Deere for 100% of its applicator axles. Transitioning to electrification, Slide 5 gives you a look at additional contracts we've secured for our ePowertrain. As mentioned last quarter, we believe we'll be the first supplier to manufacture electric ePowertrains for Class 8 trucks. These new contracts reflect the application flexibility we've designed into our electric powertrain portfolio, and the growing demand for Meritor's solution. The ePowertrain is an integrated product, engineered to allow for a variety of subsystems, including axle, transmission, motors, wheel ends, and brakes, to function as one efficient system.  We have entered into a five-year agreement to supply Meritor's 14Xe electric powertrains for Autocar's refuse vehicle. With Lion Electric, a Canadian manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles, we signed a three-year agreement to supply our heavy duty tandem electric powertrain for Lion's AT tractor. And we've also secured a three-year contract with Volta Trucks in London. Meritor's 14Xe will be equipped on the Volta Zero, a full land 16-tonne commercial vehicle designed for inner city parcel and freight distribution. We expect revenues from all these contracts to ramp up in 2023. With the industry recognition we have already received for this product, the growing number of production contracts, we are highly confident that Meritor's electric powertrain represents game-changing technology for commercial vehicles.  Carl will now provide more detail on our financial results. James, it's Chris Villavarayan. I'll take that question. So what we talked about is a line of sight for $500 million, of which, with the announcements we've made today with booked business to $400 million. And we still have our line of sight for the last $100 million to the targets that we had provided earlier. And then talking about the three agreements that we announced today with Lion Electric Volta, and Autocar, that accounts for a total of $200 million of booked up business in total. We're not breaking that out by year. Sure. Ryan, it's Chris Villavarayan. I'll start the question and then maybe hand it over to Carl to just provide some of the financials. But very quickly, with the acquisition of AxleTech, obviously this has been a very important market. And so, as part of M2022, we also had a strategy to grow in this market. And so, what we're doing is exactly executing on that strategy. The new win is part of a growth strategy and is not associated with the current market growth. So we had a plan to grow this business, and that's exactly what we're doing.  Specific to electrification, we are looking at, let's call it independent suspensions with Wieland Motors, but that is something that we're exploring a little bit further. With that, I'm going to turn it to Carl. Well, I'll take that question, Ryan. Just maybe first perspective, from a broad spectrum, when we look at the three customer awards that we presented today, Autocar, a nameplate that's been around for 125 - 123 years. And then if you look at Volta, it's a brand new entrant, and Lion's been in the market for about 10 years. So it's great to see that from a broad spectrum of customers, they see the value in Meritor's product. Now, specific to where we see this growth, we do see - the first thing that we're focused on is obviously completing our pipeline. And to that point, we're testing with a multitude of OEs right now around the globe. So hopefully we can talk about more wins here, but right now, we're targeting - targeted on closing out on our $500 million book of business that we talk about. Specific to the GM, and let's call it the skateboard, I think when you look at - the best part about it is, in terms of whether you look at OEs integrating this, the best part of electrification is in any sense, I think what it does is, it drives competition, and it will speed us faster towards sustainable energy. And in any sense, as we look at the real estate we have, it just means more content for us, no matter what happens. And in that sense, our perspective is that as long as we're in this space, this will continue to grow for us. So, Joe, I'll take that question. And I think the perspective that we use, if we look at the Class 8, let's call it the medium and the heavy duty Class 8 market, and we look at, what is the percentage of electrification, and we aim for that, or a percentage - a fair share of that. And in essence, work with every OE that is approaching that space and provide our product. But in overall in how we capacitize, we're looking at what we believe will be the model of what roles will be there in electrification as a percentage of the overall market. Yes. I think, Joe, to that point, I think it's - for us, it's more about the product as far as all the development, all of the testing that we have done and kind of how that stands. And I do think, as we think about how that fits in with whether a couple of the startups with existing customers and obviously the large OE customers we have today, that is kind of the focus. And we do believe our product is a differentiator, and that will - is really kind of the path to market for us across all of these potential opportunities. Yes. So nothing was new. This was just - we didn't talk about this last quarter as well. So we just helped to try to frame what the impact we will see in \u201822 as a result from these optimization plans. So in total, we are expecting, as you kind of compare \u201822 to \u201821, it's probably somewhere about $13 million to $15 million of tailwind, if we think about EBITDA as we enter '22, once we're fully are - complete these facility closures. Well, that's - as you said, maybe the best way to answer that, Brian, is we ... We do, Brian. And I think, just as you have experienced with Jay, we've in essence, always done - started preparing for the release of it a year in advance. And so, we're in the process of developing our M2025 strategy. And ideally, we'd like to have it with all of you in-person, probably at the end of the year or worst case, let's call it at the beginning of next year. But that's our goal right now, is to drive for the end of this year. Sure. Let me - Bruce, I'll take that question. So when - in terms of the market, obviously going back probably fall of last year, not too many of us could have predicted this return. However, as we looked at the last November, December, 40s and supplies, truck order intakes, and then with January at 42,000, in essence what we're seeing from our customers is, all of them are cautiously raising line rates up, primarily focused on three things. One is COVID. The second one is looking at the impact of the supply chains. And then the final one is also being mindful of finding folks to be able to staff up the shifts.  So - but with that, what we're seeing right now is, the backend or the mid to backend of this is, line rates are starting to come back up with most of our customers. So that's one perspective. And specific to electrification, I think it's a very fair question. I think when you think about electrification, the cyclicality should come out because of - you think about a growth that is much more muted as the growth goes through. I think we'll see far less cyclicality. So I hope that's helpful."

            "name": "Carl Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning. On today's call, I will review our first quarter financial results, discuss the upturn we are seeing in most of our global markets, and provide an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Overall, as you heard from Chris, we delivered strong financial performance in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5%, and we generated $34 million of free cash flow.  Now, let me provide the details of our financial results compared to the prior year on Slide 6. Beginning with total company results, revenue came in at $889 million, roughly flat from the same period last year. Net income from continuing operations was $32 million, compared to $39 million in the prior year. Lower net income was primarily the result of higher interest expense, which included $8 million of debt extinguishment costs incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. This was partially offset by cost reduction actions executed in the second half of last year.  Additionally, joint venture earnings increased $5 million from a year ago. This was driven primarily from a $6 million one-time gain recognized from our joint venture in Brazil relating to a value added tax credit. Overall, this drove adjusted EBITDA of $102 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2021, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.5%, a 50 basis point increase from the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.60, down slightly from $0.64 last year. And free cash flow improved by $69 million from a year ago, as we saw a tailwind from our back stream programs, and we had $32 million in lower incentive compensation payments in the quarter. Now, let's look at our segment results compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck increased by 4% to $691 million. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by slightly higher market bounds in Europe and India. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $63 million, up $6 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 9.1%, an increase of 50 basis points over the prior year.  The increase in segment adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin was driven primarily by conversion on higher revenue, cost reduction actions executed last year, and higher joint venture earnings. This was partially offset by higher freight premiums, and a $6 million increase in electrification spend, as compared to last year. Aftermarket industrial sales were $234 million in the first quarter, down $41 million compared to the prior year. The decrease in sales was primarily driven by the termination of the distribution arrangement with WABCO, which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As we saw last quarter, even with lower revenue, segment adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points to 15%. The increase was driven by cost reduction actions executed last year, which more than offset the impact from lower revenue.  I'll review our current global market outlook on Slide 7. In the North America Class 8 market, we are now projecting production levels between 270,000 to 290,000 units, a nearly 20% increase at the midpoint from our prior outlook. We have seen a full quarter of strong order intakes, including two months of orders greater than 50,000 units. And just last night, January preliminary orders came in at over 42,000 units. This aligns with the strong production forecast we are seeing from our customers, all pointing to a significant production recovery in 2021. Turning to Europe, we're also seeing a steady increase in this market. We now forecast production will be in the range of 360,000 to 380,000 units. South America is another market where we are experiencing a strong rebound. We are now forecasting production to be in the range of 135,000 to 145,000 units, almost a 50% increase at the mid-point from our prior outlook. At these levels, it would be the strongest Class 8 production year since 2014. And in India, we are maintaining our previous forecast of 230,000 to 250,000 units. Keep in mind, this still represents an increase of approximately 80% year-over -year from historically low volumes in 2020. Let's turn to Slide 8 for an update to our fiscal year 2021 outlook. Given the market assumptions we just reviewed, we are now forecasting sales to be in the range of 3.65 billion to 3.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 10.6% to 10.8%, an increase of 100 basis points as compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance. With the upturn, we are encountering several headwinds which will impact earnings conversions as we move through 2021. Increasing demand across the global economy is driving significant increases in steel, our largest material cost.  While we have cost recovery mechanisms in place with most of our OE customers, they generally are on a three to six month lag. As a result, we are currently seeing $15 million to $20 million in higher steel costs in fiscal 2021, due to the timing impact of these cost recovery mechanisms. Additionally, at the significantly higher market levels, we are anticipating higher incentive compensation costs of approximately $15 million. With these headwinds, we now anticipate earnings conversion of approximately 19% on incremental revenue, compared to last year. Overall, if you were to adjust for these two items, our conversion on the incremental revenue would be around 22 to 23%, more in line with our expectations. Moving to adjusted diluted earnings per share, our outlook for 2021 is now the range of $2.25 and $2.50. And finally, we expect to generate $110 million to $125 million of free cash flow.  On Slide 9, I want to provide an update to our path for achieving the company's M2022 margin target of 12.5%. As we have seen in prior M-plans, the steps for achieving our targets may change, but we typically are able to adjust to the current operating environment and deliver on our targets. The 12.5% margin target is no exception. As we discussed on the previous slide, we are seeing increased costs related to both steel and incentive compensation in 2021. Next year, we do expect these costs to normalize, providing a 60 to 80 basis point tailwind. We also anticipate converting on incremental volume and new business wins at greater than 20%.  Additionally, as we announced last quarter, we are in the process of executing a footprint optimization plan, which will result in the consolidation of four locations into existing facilities. This will provide an additional tailwind of $12 million to $15 million, as $5 million of cost to execute the consolidation in 2021, will be behind us, and approximately $7 million to $10 million of savings from the smaller footprint, will be realized. The conversion on increased revenue and the footprint optimization, are expected to provide an additional 90 to 130 basis points of incremental margin next year. Overall, the path to achieving our 12.5% margin target remains clear.  Before I turn the call back over to Jay, I want to take a moment to express my deepest appreciation for his extraordinary leadership he's shown through his many years at Meritor. On both a personal and professional level, I wish Jay all the best, and look forward to working with him in his new role. Now, I will turn the call over to Jay for final remarks. Good morning, James. Yes, as it relates to fiscal '21, as I referenced, we do expect all in, to have about 19% conversion on the incremental revenue that we're seeing. We are faced with a couple of headwinds, and I referenced both steel and incentive compensation, but with - and as it relates to electrification. In the quarter, we did at $6 million of higher electrification spend compared to a year ago. We are also probably tracking closer to the $30 million of electrification expense within fiscal year \u201821 as well. So overall, as we look forward, we're very confident in our ability to continue to deliver and get close to that 20% kind of incremental margins for fiscal 21, but more importantly, it really is - as I laid out, we're definitely on track to deliver on our \u201822 target. Yes. It's about 7 million to 8 million higher than we did a year ago. Ryan, that business kind of resides in our industrial segment. And if I look at what we're seeing in that, especially entering into \u201821 in total, we do now see our industrial business up on a high single digit percent on a year-over-year basis at this point. Yes, Joe, as we look at it, we're not chasing all the various startups. We're really just focused on what's fitting our product portfolio. So that's kind of one of the first lens that we look through. And as Chris just discussed, we are - we both have the kit side, as well as the 14Xe and the axle side, and 17Xe in the future. And as we look forward, our expectation is, when it kind of flips to profitability, it's probably outside the \u201822 time horizon, but as we see it now, that that can come potentially as early as in 2023, depending on what we're seeing in the market at that time. Yes, I think, Brian, I would say, over the last six years, we've seen that margin move up, not only cost reductions, but from all the new products we've introduced, taken out the traditional side. And I would say, our expectations for the electric products are no different. We'll be introducing products we think have more concepts and higher margin. Okay. Good morning, Itay. As it relates to - maybe I'll answer the free cash flow first, yes, no change in our planning assumptions for '22. We still expect to drive and achieve the 75% free cash flow conversion. I think in the short term, in \u201821, I think every cash flow is cutting a high 50% - just about 70% as we are expanding a little bit of our CapEx spend this year by about $10 million, which is one of the drivers to that. As relating to the end market assumptions, we're not updating them today, but what we did say back in November, we were still planning for replacement demand market levels in North America and Europe, primarily in 2022. And it's something that, just based off the strength of the market that we're seeing here in '21, we will be taking a closer look at that once again as we kind of get later out this year and provide a further update as we kind of get into \u201822."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nChris Clulow: Thank you very much. Good morning everyone and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins\u2019 results for the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the full year performance. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that, some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today\u2019s webcast presentations are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.\nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with a summary of 2022, discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. Last year was an incredibly exciting one for Cummins and our stakeholders. We made significant strides in our inorganic growth strategy, most notably through the acquisitions of Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Meritor and the Siemens Commercial Vehicles business. We also navigated complex global supply chain challenges, advanced our preparation for the separation of our filtration business and transition from Tom to me as the CEO. We accomplished all of this and delivered record revenues, EBITDA, and earnings per share in 2022. We did so with the focus on the exciting opportunity in front of us to lead the industry to a broader clean economy and do so in a way that is best for our stakeholders and the planet. Decarbonization is a growth opportunity for Cummins, uniting our business and climate goals. In 2022, we launched our long-term decarbonization growth strategy, Destination Zero, which includes making meaningful reductions in carbon emissions through advanced internal combustion technologies widely accepted by the market today, while continuing to invest in and advance zero emissions technologies ahead of widespread market adoption. As part of our organic growth strategy, we unveiled the industry\u2019s first unified fuel-agnostic internal combustion powertrain platforms, and we continue to see momentum in our electrolyzer technology and green hydrogen production opportunities. Demand for our products remains strong across all of our key markets and regions with the notable exception of China, resulting in strong revenues in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $7.8 billion. Excluding the Meritor business, revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven by increased demand in many of our North America markets. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance, I\u2019m excluding the Meritor operating results and associated acquisition and integration costs, the costs related to the separation of the filtration business and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. Mark will provide more detail on the reported results in his comments. With these exclusions considered, EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16.1% of sales in Q4, above our guidance of 15.5% and stronger than the $705 million or 12.1% reported a year ago. EBITDA and percentage improved due to an increase in gross margins with positive pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage costs and some improvement in logistics costs, all of which offset increases in material costs. Gross margin improvement is key to meeting our long-term goals of increasing the returns in our core business while transitioning our New Power business to break even EBITDA by 2027. In the fourth quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement, and we continue to accelerate value capture opportunities across the business. Our employees have done an excellent job in integrating the Meritor operations and people within Cummins and continue to make strides in identifying cost reduction opportunities. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $130 million in pretax synergies we referenced upon completion of the acquisition. And in addition, we expect to deliver incremental tax synergies as we integrate the business. Excluding Meritor, 2022 revenues were a record $26.2 billion, 9% higher than 2021. Also excluding Meritor, the costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business and the impact of the indefinite suspension of our Russia operations, full year EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% of sales compared to $3.5 billion or 14.7% of sales in 2021. Improved volumes, better price realization and an improved supply chain environment more than offset higher compensation expenses, increased material costs and lower joint venture income for the year. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in Engine, Power Systems, Distribution and Components segments. Leading the way was the Components segment, which delivered 150 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. The Power Systems business finished 2022 with another solid quarter and delivered full year EBITDA of 12.2%, up from 11.2% last year. The improvement in performance in this segment over the past six months is encouraging, and you will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year. EBITDA margins in the distribution business increased by 110 basis points. Our reported full year 2022 results include five months of operational performance for Meritor or $1.9 billion of revenue and $26 million of EBITDA, including $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting related costs. Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2023 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2023 guidance includes our expected results of the Meritor business and excludes the costs or benefits associated with the separation of the filtration business. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2023 to increase 12% to 17%, compared to 2022 and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales, driven by the inclusion of a full year of sales from Meritor, continued strength in the North American truck market, improved demand in power generation markets, overall pricing improvement and slow improvement in the China on-highway markets. Industry\u2019s production for heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 260,000 to 280,000 units in 2023, a range of a 5% decline to 2% improvement year-over-year. In medium-duty truck, we expect the market size to be 125,000 to 140,000 units, flat to up 10% from 2022. We expect our deliveries in North America to continue to outpace the market, as the engine partnerships we announced in 2021 continue to phase in. Our Engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 units in 2023, volume levels consistent with 2022. In China, we project total revenue including joint ventures to increase 7% in 2023. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in heavy and medium duty truck demand and 10% to 20% improvement in demand in the light duty truck market, coming off the low market levels in 2022. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 25% to 35% in 2023 as the market adjusts to new emissions regulations and digests inventory on hand. We are watching the situation in China closely, with ensuring the safety and well-being of our people as our first priority. The change in the country\u2019s COVID lockdown policy could positively impact our operations in the coming months. The current events make it difficult to gauge. The markets within China are at a low point, as we close out 2022 and our guidance assumes a slow recovery in 2023. In India, we project total revenue including joint ventures to be up 1% in 2023. We expect the industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high-horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, dependent upon the trajectory of commodity prices and supply chain improvement. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 15% to 25% in 2023, primarily driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10% to 15%, driven by increases in non-residential construction and improvements in the data center market. In New Power, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, more than doubling our 2022 revenues. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to convert to backlog and to be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, we shared that we had reached the milestone of a $100 million in electrolyzer backlog. This tripled to $300 million at the end of 2022, demonstrating the strong momentum in this market. With demand continuing to rise, we are focused on adding capacity for electrolyzer production. During 2022 we announced several capacity expansion investments and expect to have more than two gigawatts of scalable capacity in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe across Europe, North America and China. Additionally, we will continue to deliver battery, electric and fuel cell systems along with electric powertrain technologies as adoption continues in the transportation markets. As mentioned, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. We are continuing to drive improvement in our margins post-acquisition and expect Meritor to be accretive to earnings per share in 2023. We will continue to provide updates on the progress of our value capture initiatives, which will be focused on the portion of the business within our Components segment. Within Components, we expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in revenue in 2023 with EBITDA margins in the range of 10.3% to 11%, an improvement from the comparable 2022 EBITDA margin of 7.2%. The electric powertrain portion of the Meritor business has been integrated within the New Power portfolio with projected 2023 EBITDA losses of $55 million included in the overall guidance for that segment. In 2023 we anticipate that demand will remain strong in most of our key regions and markets, especially in the first half of the year. While some macroeconomic indicators have weakened in recent months, we have not seen a significant change in customer orders at this time. In summary, we expect full year sales growth of 12% to 17% and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales. We have taken a number of actions to improve our EBITDA in 2023 and expect to generate very strong incremental margins within our core business and improve the margins of the Meritor business while continuing to invest in our New Power business. Having effectively managed through the challenges of the past couple years we expect improved performance in 2023 and are well positioned to invest in future growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail.\nMark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. There are four key takeaways from my comments today. First, we delivered strong results in the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding our own projections for revenue and EBITDA from three months ago, and we delivered stronger margins Engines, Components, Distribution and Power Systems compared to a year ago. Second, we continue to make good progress on the integration of Meritor and we remain on-track to deliver $130 million of pretax synergies by the end of year three. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2022 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, demand for our products remains strong, supporting increased revenues in our core business and New Power and growth in EBITDA and earnings per share in 2023. Now, let me go into more details on the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter reported revenues were $7.8 billion and EBITDA of $1.1 billion or 14.2%. For the full year, revenues were $28.1 billion and EBITDA of $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales. Also in the fourth quarter, Meritor generated $1.2 billion of revenue, $60 million of EBITDA, after incurring $27 million of acquisition and integration related costs. Our fourth quarter results also included $19 million of costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business. Full year 2022 results included five months of operational performance for Meritor, yielding $1.9 billion of revenue, $26 million of EBITDA, reflecting $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting related costs. We will all look forward to a cleaner set of numbers in 2023. Our full year 2022 results also included $81 million of costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business and $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance. I am excluding the Meritor results and the separation of filtration and the indefinite suspension of Russia in my following comments. But hopefully, you are clear after my earlier remarks about the magnitude of those -- each of those items. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 25%, driven by continued strong demand in truck markets. International revenues decreased 1% with stronger demand for power generation and mining equipment in most markets, offset by declines in China and, of course, the impact of our suspension of our operations in Russia. Currency movements negatively impacted sales by 4% due to a stronger U.S. dollar. EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16.1% compared to $705 million or 12.1% a year ago. EBITDA increased by $359 million due mainly to improved pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage expenses, all of which contributed to stronger gross margin performance and more than offset higher material costs. Now, let\u2019s go into our income statement, a little more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.7 billion or 26.3% of sales increased by $420 million or 380 basis points from a year ago. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $52 million or 6% due to higher compensation and research costs as we continue to invest in new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth, particularly in the Engines and New Power segments. Joint venture income decreased $28 million due to lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was $44 million, an increase of $13 million from a year ago, primarily due to higher pension income. Interest expense increased $58 million, largely driven by the financing costs associated with the acquisition of Meritor. The all-in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17.2%, including $52 million or $0.36 per diluted share -- favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter was $631 million or $4.43 per diluted share, up from $394 million or $2.73 a year ago. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $817 million, including Meritor and, $85 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by higher earnings. For the full year \u201822, revenues were a record $26.2 billion or up 9% from a year ago, with sales in North America up 18% and international revenues down 2%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues for the full year by 2%. EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% for 2022 compared to $3.5 billion of 14.7% of sales a year ago. Improvements in Components, Distribution, Power Systems and Engine margins were partially offset by increased investment in New Power and more than $100 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin some of our nonqualified benefit plans. All of that run through our operating EBITDA. All-in net earnings were $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share compared to $2.1 billion or $14.61 per diluted share a year ago. Full year cash from operations was $2 billion, down from $2.3 billion, primarily due to higher inventory levels. Capital expenditures in 2022 were $916 million, an increase of $182 million from 2021 as we continue to invest in new products and capacity expansion critical for future growth. We returned $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders or 63% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends last year. Now, moving on to our guidance for 2023, which includes Meritor, and thankfully, reduces the number of exclusions we\u2019ll have to explain each quarter, and I appreciate your patience as we work through that in 2022. We are excluding any separation costs associated with filtration, and for now, we\u2019re assuming that the operating results of filtration are in our guidance for the full year 2023, as the timing of that separation is not yet determined. We expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion of revenue in 2023. We currently project 2023 company revenues, including Meritor, to be up 12% to 17% and company-wide EBITDA margins expected to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.2%. In \u201823, we expect revenues for the Engine business will be flat to up 5%, driven by continued strength in North American truck market and a modest recovery in China. 2023 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5% compared to 14.4% in 2022. We expect distribution revenues this year to be up 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% compared to 10.5% in 2022. Including Meritor, we expect 2023 components revenues to increase 28% to 33% and EBITDA margins in the range of 14.1% to 14.8% compared to 15.0% in 2022. In \u201823, we also expect Power Systems revenues to be up 5% to 10% due to higher demand for oil and gas engines and power generation equipment globally. EBITDA there is projected to be between 13% and 13.7%, up from 12.2% of sales last year. And also this year, we expect New Power revenues to increase to the range of $350 million to $400 million. We expect New Power net losses to be in the range of $370 million to $390 million as we continue to make targeted investments in capacity, technology to support growing customer demand. Our goal remains to achieve breakeven EBITDA in 2027. Our effective tax rate this year is expected to be approximately 22%, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion this year. We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders over time and have accelerated cash returns to shareholders in recent years above that 50% goal when we have generated more cash than required to support our strategy. In 2023, we will prioritize cash towards dividends and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor while continuing to invest to deliver future profitable growth. Having a strong balance sheet is an important asset as we navigate through economic cycles and sustain our investments in new products for existing and new markets. To summarize, we delivered record sales, strong full year earnings in 2022, while managing through supply chain challenges and a very weak demand environment in China. As we move through 2023, demand for our products remains strong in most of our core markets with good visibility into the first half of the year. We\u2019ll continue to focus on raising margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, generating strong cash flow and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in the adoption of new technologies and penetrate new markets through our New Power business. Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it over to Chris.\nChris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we\u2019re ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: I know it\u2019s early post the acquisition of the Siemens propulsion systems and Meritor, but wondering if you could just comment on what the acceptance has been of the products in the marketplace? Post-Cummins ownership, what\u2019s the pipeline from the developments look like? How is that cross-selling working out versus what you folks had expected before acquiring the assets? Thanks.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Thanks, Jerry, for the question. Yes, we are right now really focused on integrating the Meritor business, the Siemens Commercial Vehicle business and the investments that we were already making within New Power and having a number of conversations with our customers on how we bring that together to deliver those electric powertrains and components to meet their needs. So, it brings some strong products, employees as well as customer relationships, and we\u2019re seeing growing opportunities as we have relationships at a senior more strategic level with these customers to grow our business going forward. It\u2019s really early days at this point, so we\u2019ll continue to talk about that as we bring those businesses together.\nJerry Revich: Sounds good, Jennifer, thanks. And Mark, can I ask in terms of the pricing that you\u2019re expecting in \u201823 within the outlook? And if you could just touch on the logistics costs embedded in the guide as well. You folks have been running pretty hot to hit deliveries in \u201822. I\u2019m wondering to what extent does that a tailwind within the guidance?\nMark Smith: Yes, we\u2019ve got about 2% of price cost benefit embedded in the guidance, Jerry. That\u2019s the biggest single driver of margin improvement.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJamie Cook: I guess, two questions. Just given the concern on the macro out there, can you guys speak to by business line where you see the most visibility or where demand trends do you see sort of weakening? And then, I guess, on the engine margin guidance. I guess, I would have thought margins would have been a little better in implied guide just given maybe price cost going away, China improving. So, if you can just help me bridge 2023 to 2022 engine margins what\u2019s implied? Thank you.\nJennifer Rumsey: Great. Thanks, Jamie. Let me speak first to what we\u2019re seeing in the market. And we, of course, are paying attention to some of these macroeconomic trends. If you take just the North America truck market as a starting point, while there has been some decrease in spot rates, we still continue to see healthy freight activity and strong backlogs out through the first half, which gives us confidence that the market is going to remain strong, certainly through the first half of the year. And it\u2019s important to note, it\u2019s just not been a typical cycle for us because for the last two years, we\u2019ve been undersupplying to the market demand. They\u2019ve been using that equipment. We\u2019re seeing that reflected in very high aftermarket demand which continues, and these new trucks provide efficiency benefits to the fleet. So, we continue to expect strong North America truck market. In the Power Systems business, again, we have a healthy backlog of products and strong demand across many of our markets. Mining, we\u2019re forecasting to remain around flat, but growth in power generation, growth in the oil and gas business. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty confident about that as well. The biggest uncertainty is really around China. And as I said in my comments, we do project some slow recovery throughout 2023. With the lift of the stringent lockdowns that they had in the last couple of years in December, we expect that that may result in economic strengthening and certainly, less operational disruption, but we\u2019re still monitoring what happens with the COVID waves there, is there any government stimulus into the economy. We feel really well positioned there. We\u2019ve launched our NS VI products, which we think will enable Cummins to grow our position in the market. We\u2019ve launched the automated manual transmission there. We\u2019ve got a new natural gas platform. So, we\u2019re really well positioned as China continues to strengthen and just uncertainty on exactly what the shape of that will look like. I\u2019ll let Mark talk about the margin question.\nMark Smith: Yes. I think the main thing on the Engine business margins is that we haven\u2019t got building a very strong recovery in China. And then the other piece that you didn\u2019t mention, Jamie, is that we\u2019ve got fairly sustained investments ahead of us over the next couple of years because we\u2019re updating several of our platforms. We\u2019ve won a lot of external business, and we\u2019ve got to meet future emissions regulations. So, that\u2019s the only other element that\u2019s running through the Engine business that may not be obvious from the outside, but otherwise, we\u2019ll expect them to do well if markets continue to be strong.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephen Volkmann: Maybe just following on, on the Engine margin question, Mark. Given what you just described around increased spending, R&D, et cetera, should we think about sort of flattish incremental margins over the next few years, or can it still be better than that, if we have some volume?\nMark Smith: I think it can definitely be better than that. We\u2019re still battling some inefficiencies here and there Steve. We\u2019re still expecting to have aftermarket growth over time. So no, we\u2019re not locked into these margins. I was just trying to be clear on what the underlying factors. I\u2019ve seen a few comments around Engine business margins, but no, I think they can go higher. Getting China, which is the world\u2019s biggest truck market, I know the earnings come through JV, we have the lowest market in a decade. And we think we still got more share to gain there. We\u2019ve got more content in the Components business. So, if I sit here today and say what could be the one thing that could move that could change our guidance most clearly, I would agree with Jen, it would be China, right now. We don\u2019t have visibility. People are more enthusiastic, but the activity hasn\u2019t yet materially picked up. So, that would be one important factor.\nStephen Volkmann: Great, understood. And then, my follow-on maybe a bigger, broader question. But as we start very early days but we start to think about the 2027 emissions regulations, do you guys feel like you have line of sight to what you need to do technically to get there? We\u2019re starting to hear that this is going to be sort of the biggest emission hurdle ever and that some people may have trouble getting there or maybe have some massive costs associated with it, which has some implications for prebuys and maybe whether people do it themselves or outsource it to you, just your big picture thinking on 2027 and how that kind of plays through.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. We are focused on continuing to meet more stringent regulatory requirements and do so with products that will provide benefits to the environment and exceed our customer needs. We now have clarity on the EPA 2027 NOx regulations that happened late last year, and they finalize that standard at a 0.035 gram NOx. And our intention is to offer a full product lineup with our new fuel-agnostic engine platforms to meet that regulation, and we\u2019re finalizing our product plans right now with our customers on those. But we really feel well positioned to invest in really as a part of our Destination Zero strategy, reduce CO2 and NOx impact to the environment and offer products -- market-leading products to our customers with that regulation.\nOperator: The next question is coming from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Raso: Hi. Thank you. The China guide, the up 7%, I assume that includes consolidated and JV revenue, sort of how you usually kind of speak to it.\nMark Smith: Yes.\nDavid Raso: Even -- maybe can you update us on the mix of your end markets? It feels like the consolidated off-highway, the construction exposure you have that shows up in the P&L more so than JV, and the JV is more of the on-highway. I\u2019m surprised with the mix because that construction business at this stage must be pretty small after the declines we\u2019ve seen. So, to have truck up double digit for China, for heavy and light, even though the excavator is down a lot, the mix would suggest you\u2019d be up more than 7%, if truck is up double digit and at now relatively small construction business is down. Are there other businesses keeping it only at 7%? Is there a share comment there? Just trying to understand why only up 7% with that China end market guide?\nMark Smith: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything significant in there, David. I mean, obviously, whether it\u2019s consolidated or unconsolidated, trucks probably [70%] plus when you add up all of our markets. So, the truck does better, we\u2019ll be up more than 7%. If it doesn\u2019t, we won\u2019t. I think for components, that\u2019s all consolidated revenue. That\u2019s almost entirely on-highway. It\u2019s really the engine business that has the off-highway business of any of any size. And then, yes, I think Power Systems has been pretty strong last year in China. It has probably been the exception to what we\u2019ve seen in every other market. But there\u2019s no big change in dynamics.\nJennifer Rumsey: Just on your share, we expect to continue to grow our share in the China market with the launch of the NS VI product. So, that\u2019s assumed in our guidance.\nDavid Raso: I\u2019d even think with some of the transmissions as well. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand like Photon is struggling more than I would have thought. It\u2019s still barely making money now for two quarters in a row. Is there something about that dynamic we should be more sensitive to on the margin recovery in China in the JV because of Photon?\nMark Smith: No. We did get some sizable tech fees and other things from the early part of last year, which kind of helped -- the wrong word, we were entitled to those based on product launches, but no, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything significant there.\nDavid Raso: And I\u2019ll hop off, just one kind of modeling question. If you take the interest expense in the fourth quarter and annualize it, it\u2019s $348 million. You mentioned there\u2019s debt reduction, but your guide is $380 million. I mean, what are we assuming for interest rates from the fourth quarter on to have up interest expense, but you\u2019re targeting debt reduction?\nMark Smith: Right. So, I think the answer to that is, we\u2019ll need to keep working that down. I think we\u2019ve got some floating rate exposure. It\u2019s not all fixed, and probably, the debt reduction will come in the second half of the year, but let me come back to you on that, David.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Hi. I know it\u2019s still early days, but you\u2019re starting to see some ramp in electrolyzers. And I guess there\u2019s obviously a lot of uncertainty as to what the ultimate margin structure is going to be, New Power or clean energy generally. So I wonder if you have any thoughts on when you see clarity, any thoughts on where gross margins might trend. Maybe you\u2019re still heavily investing, but the gross margins are improving, or just your thoughts on how the curve of profitability is shaping up in clean tech.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, the electrolyzer business is really going to drive the majority of our progress towards breakeven in \u201827 for New Power and the growth aspirations that we shared for 2030. And so, we expect during that time frame to scale up the product, the supply chain and manufacturing and continue to see growing backlog and conversion of orders into revenue. And so through that time period, you\u2019ll see margins going positive and improving, the exact margin structure of that business is still unclear. There\u2019s not a lot of suppliers in the market, and we expect demand to be quite strong through that time period. So, I\u2019m optimistic on what margin structure for the business will look like. But, obviously, we\u2019ll share more as we get towards that breakeven point and go margin positive.\nMark Smith: Yes. Rob, one thing I\u2019ll add is, for the gross margin on a project basis, we\u2019re at gross margin positive last year, which is a good early indicator. We have other costs that are going in, too, for capacity expansion and other things that obviously offsets that, but it\u2019s a good indicator that we\u2019re on the right path for profitability as we move forward with more volume.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And obviously, there\u2019s just still a lot of build-out in manufacturing and supply chain. So, do you have a sense as to how you stack up competitively on either design cost, or I guess you have a lot of advantages in manufacturing as you build out and off the top there.\nJennifer Rumsey: I mean one of the advantages we have here is we\u2019re able to leverage our existing footprint and capability that we have as a part of the broader comment. So, you saw us announce recently, we plan to use our Fridley manufacturing facility for electrolyzer production in North America. So, we are tapping into that strength we have in our footprint and supply chain capability to help build out profitable both product as well as supply chain. And that\u2019s an advantage that I think Cummins has here.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: Maybe just on the distribution margins. It looks like you guys aren\u2019t expecting margin expansion there, even though sales are up 2% to 7%. I guess what is the reason for that?\nMark Smith: I think there\u2019s a little bit of improvement baked into the guidance, but we\u2019ve got a pretty strong track record of improving. There\u2019s no structural impediments to growing margins over time. It\u2019s a range. So, under the different revenue scenarios, some variation, Nicole. But over the time, we expect the margins to keep going up.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay, understood. Thanks. And then I guess Power Systems stood out to me. On the other side, it\u2019s just the margins look really impressive year-on-year in 2023. Is price/cost the biggest driver of that, or is there any other big drivers of the margin expansion that you guys are expecting?\nMark Smith: I think, certainly, that\u2019s been a big factor, and we\u2019ve got pretty healthy demand locked in now. So, there\u2019s been a lot of focus on that business. We\u2019ve been pleased with the solid results, particularly in the second half of this year, and we just -- we\u2019ve got a very, very strong focus on continuing to drive\u2026\nJennifer Rumsey: For that business, it\u2019s important to keep in mind, you see a very long -- we have a very long lead time on orders. So, as costs accelerated, it took a while for us to pass on some of the price increases to offset that, and that is in part what drove the strong margin improvement from \u201821 to \u201822.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matt Elkott of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Elkott: If you can give us a sense of how much of a growth moderation can we expect in the second half? I\u2019m assuming that will be the case directionally because you\u2019ll have the Meritor comps. And also, it sounds like you guys are more cautious on the second half. So, how much of a growth moderation are we expecting?\nMark Smith: You can roughly split our revenues 52% to 53% in the first half versus the second half, Matt.\nMatthew Elkott: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, just one follow-up on the New Power front. It\u2019s been about a year since you guys announced the fuel agnostic engine. So, any update on that and the receptiveness from customers in your conversations? And also, I think back in August PACCAR announced that they\u2019re using your new natural gas engine. So, is there anything new on that front as well?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So, the fuel agnostic platform, just to clarify, that\u2019s being developed as a part of our Engine business. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ll launch a full lineup in North America of that product as a part of the 27 EPA regulation. As you\u2019ve seen, PACCAR is integrating and plans to introduce the natural gas version, and we have customers that are very interested in that product, including with renewable natural gas, and we announced partnerships around that. We also announced a memorandum of understanding with Tata late last year on the hydrogen version of that platform. And so really, we see a lot of interest in those platforms, both as a way to improve efficiency of diesel engines and then create flexibility to move to other fuels such as natural gas or hydrogen with the platform and really minimizing the integration pair up that\u2019s required for customers as they move between those platforms. So, we\u2019ll begin to launch those with the natural gas version here, in North America in late \u201823, early \u201824 and then accelerate introduction in the coming years after that.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Can you characterize the current mix of investment spending in New Power? Just kind of give us a sense of the key buckets where you\u2019re spending? Maybe you can even give us some guidelines on how much of the CapEx for this year would be attributed to New Power? And then, I think the higher question here is, are you ready to call 2023 kind of the peak of net investment spending for the segment?\nJennifer Rumsey: At a high level, the different categories of investment in New Power, of course, there\u2019s big investments happening in electrolyzers, and we talked about the growth and capacity investments that we\u2019re making there. The other buckets include investments in batteries, other electrified components in the electric powertrain and then in fuel cells. So, we\u2019re investing end of the prime mover as well as some of the key components to position ourselves as our current markets start to move to electrified powertrains to be both the powertrain provider as well as provide key components similar to the model we have today with Engine business and Components. You want to talk about allocation of investment?\nMark Smith: Yes. So CapEx, probably in the $100 million to $125 million range. So just under 10% of the total for the company in the New Power segment, and most -- more of that\u2019s weighted towards electrolyzers where, of course, we\u2019re ramping up production, albeit using existing Cummins sites, where possible and appropriate. And then, yes, I\u2019d love to call the peak in New Power losses. They\u2019re going to have to peak soon because we\u2019re aiming towards breakeven in 2027 at the EBITDA level. The only caveat is, if there\u2019s a significant change, should we invest in some new capabilities that aren\u2019t part of our current portfolio? That\u2019s not part of our plan today, Noah, but that would be the only variation.\nNoah Kaye: That\u2019s helpful. And then just to give us some expectations around the cadence of earnings this year, obviously, you\u2019re guiding to EBITDA, not EPS. But thinking about China JV modestly improving, getting better synergies, capture on Meritor throughout the year, but then maybe some offset from potential deterioration in some end markets. So, just any guideposts you would give us on first half versus second half, the EBITDA or even EPS?\nMark Smith: No. I mean, by and large, it will go along with the revenue. Unfortunately, we had a tough Q3 in 2022. So that probably gives us the easiest comp, just kind of going through by quarter, and then we started the year much stronger. So ex-JV, I think we\u2019ll have a good first half of the year. The JV will be the biggest single swing factor. When you look at our P&L, I would think -- in the first half of the year, maybe that helps in the second. Q3 gross margins were disappointing. We\u2019ve rebounded well in here in Q4. So yes, modestly expect first half to be stronger all in, unless revenues in the second half change direction significantly from what we\u2019ve guided.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Tami Zakaria of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTami Zakaria: So my first question is, are you expecting any synergy savings from the Meritor acquisition this year? I believe you were expecting $130 million in total by year three. So, anything this year?\nMark Smith: Absolutely. Yes, we\u2019re working very hard on that. I mean personally, along with many members of the Meritor, Cummins team. So yes, and we\u2019ll talk about those as we go along, but yes, we\u2019re feeling confident about that progress towards that $130 million.\nTami Zakaria: And some of that is embedded in guidance and assuming -- or would that be incremental?\nMark Smith: We\u2019ll try and get as much as we can -- both helps the long-term interest of that business and improve the cost structure. So yes, we expect the results clearly to improve, especially in the Components segment. We\u2019re assuming that\u2019s all in for now. If we get more, then we\u2019ll be happy to report. We won\u2019t get more than $130 million, just to be clear. That\u2019s a year three number, but we\u2019re making good progress.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. And so, I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but can you give some color on the embedded Meritor margin expansion cadence for the year? Should it be in the guided 10% to 11%, or does it ramp towards the back?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So, let me just reiterate the guidance that we had within the Components business. We have $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in revenue and EBITDA margins for the Meritor business, 10.3% to 11% compared to in 2022, that was 7.2%. And some of that is progress on price/cost in that business, operating efficiency as well as synergy cost savings.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you.\nMark Smith: I think you should just expect sequential improvement through the first half of the year from the Q4 levels.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Avi Jaroslawicz [ph] of UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions on for Steve Fisher. Just in terms of the power generation market, can you talk a little bit more about what\u2019s driving that market to be so robust this year? We might have expected data centers weakening a little bit. It sounds like you\u2019re expecting that to be up still again this year. But, if you could just talk about some of the drivers in that market.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. The power generation market really nonresidential construction as well as data centers, and despite some of the announcements that you\u2019ve seen from our data center customers regarding staffing levels, they continue to show interest in investing in data centers and have demand and drive backup power -- demand on our products in that market. So, we are still quite bullish about the opportunities there for 2023.\nMark Smith: I think it\u2019s fair to say, it\u2019s pretty broad-based across multiple markets, broad parts of the economy. Yes, the data center gets a lot of attention. It is a significant individual segment, but we\u2019re seeing robust underlying demand for power generation across multiple segments.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just in terms of the New Power business, have you seen acceleration in the recent months following the IRA in terms of customer interest there? And does that possible acceleration in the market change your view on when we could be breakeven in that business?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. How I would describe it is, the inflation reduction act and the investments around that are really going to be key to enable the adoption rate that we anticipate is going to drive an acceleration in hydrogen investment. The details around that investment are being clarified right now. So, it\u2019s going to take several years before you really see that translate into actual projects and business. Definitely, it\u2019s going to drive growth in the hydrogen market in the U.S. between now and 2030 as that -- as those incentives come in place to both put the hydrogen production in place as well as drive adoption of some of these technologies, which today, frankly, just cost more. So, you need those incentives in order to start to drive customer adoption and bring down the costs and make them more viable in the market. I mean, in the short run, we\u2019re investing more because we\u2019re building up capacity as are others in the industry. So, the faster we go in the short run could consume more cash. But obviously, we want the market to move, and we expect to deliver good gross margins once we get this kind of investment phase. So, it could go faster. It\u2019s quite a long incubation period, so very different from, say, our on-highway engine business, while we take an order. And then typically, we\u2019re shipping in a few weeks. It\u2019s not been that typical in the last 12 months versus sometimes more than a year between headline announcements to actually putting equipment into place and sometimes even more than a year. But we are encouraged, strong adoption for our technology, and yes, business is doing well on the business development side.\nOperator: We\u2019re showing time for one final question today. The final question is coming from Michael Feniger of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Feniger: When we look at China revenue, the consolidated plus JV in 2022, it\u2019s basically the lowest it\u2019s been over three, four years. I think slightly below 2019. I\u2019m just curious, in those three years, how profitability looks maybe post some restructuring optimization? If units in China recover, are you more profitable in each of those units than maybe you were in the past?\nMark Smith: Well, what\u2019s happening over time is that the content is going up, right? So, one thing that\u2019s been a big positive for our business is China consistently adopting more advanced emission standards. So the amount of revenue that we\u2019re selling is going up per vehicle quite significantly over time. And certainly, cycle over cycle, it\u2019s billions of dollars of extra revenue growth a year. We\u2019re just at the lowest market in a decade. So, we agree that that growth rate is modest. We don\u2019t have any signs yet of a rapid adoption. We\u2019ll be looking at the same data you\u2019re looking at, and obviously, taken on board the feedback from our customers, but we are profitable in our operations. We don\u2019t disclose profitability by region, but for sure, when China volumes improve, our profits will go up.\nMichael Feniger: Thank you. And we\u2019ve seen quite a few emerging suppliers in the EV, e-mobility space really struggled in the last 12 months with deliveries or profitability. Do you see some of those dynamics driving OEM conversations back to you and traditional suppliers as we start looking ahead to some of these key dates and trying to adopt more of this altered powertrain?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. We talked about this in our Analyst Day about a year ago. We expect that this transition is going to take a long time for our industry, and that positions incumbents like Cummins well because you need to invest for the long term. Regardless of what our customers are adopting, we\u2019ve got the solution in our portfolio. And so for sure, you see the benefit of a company like us that has a portfolio of options to meet their needs, it\u2019s going to be around for the long term and continuing to invest in some of these new technologies, be able to do that and support the product as an advantage, and it\u2019s playing out to be more of an advantage as time goes on compared to some of the new entrants. We continue to pay attention to those new entrants though and how they advance the technology and work to enter the market. So, we wouldn\u2019t discount them, but certainly, this long investment period makes it more challenging for them to stay in and be successful.\nMark Smith: And I think also our footprint, our reputation for dependability, wherever our customers operate, is leading us to be approached in new segments by global large industrial players. So, it\u2019s not just in the market that we operate in today, we\u2019ve been approached to expand into different market applications. That\u2019s particularly exciting.\nOperator: At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Clulow for closing comments.\nChris Clulow: Thank you all for your participation today. That concludes our teleconference. I really appreciate the interest. And as always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call this afternoon. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation and interest in today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Mark Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. There are four key takeaways from my comments today. First, we delivered strong results in the fourth quarter of 2022, exceeding our own projections for revenue and EBITDA from three months ago, and we delivered stronger margins Engines, Components, Distribution and Power Systems compared to a year ago. Second, we continue to make good progress on the integration of Meritor and we remain on-track to deliver $130 million of pretax synergies by the end of year three. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2022 in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, demand for our products remains strong, supporting increased revenues in our core business and New Power and growth in EBITDA and earnings per share in 2023. Now, let me go into more details on the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter reported revenues were $7.8 billion and EBITDA of $1.1 billion or 14.2%. For the full year, revenues were $28.1 billion and EBITDA of $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales. Also in the fourth quarter, Meritor generated $1.2 billion of revenue, $60 million of EBITDA, after incurring $27 million of acquisition and integration related costs. Our fourth quarter results also included $19 million of costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business. Full year 2022 results included five months of operational performance for Meritor, yielding $1.9 billion of revenue, $26 million of EBITDA, reflecting $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting related costs. We will all look forward to a cleaner set of numbers in 2023. Our full year 2022 results also included $81 million of costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business and $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance. I am excluding the Meritor results and the separation of filtration and the indefinite suspension of Russia in my following comments. But hopefully, you are clear after my earlier remarks about the magnitude of those -- each of those items. Fourth quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 25%, driven by continued strong demand in truck markets. International revenues decreased 1% with stronger demand for power generation and mining equipment in most markets, offset by declines in China and, of course, the impact of our suspension of our operations in Russia. Currency movements negatively impacted sales by 4% due to a stronger U.S. dollar. EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16.1% compared to $705 million or 12.1% a year ago. EBITDA increased by $359 million due mainly to improved pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage expenses, all of which contributed to stronger gross margin performance and more than offset higher material costs. Now, let's go into our income statement, a little more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.7 billion or 26.3% of sales increased by $420 million or 380 basis points from a year ago. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $52 million or 6% due to higher compensation and research costs as we continue to invest in new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth, particularly in the Engines and New Power segments. Joint venture income decreased $28 million due to lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was $44 million, an increase of $13 million from a year ago, primarily due to higher pension income. Interest expense increased $58 million, largely driven by the financing costs associated with the acquisition of Meritor. The all-in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17.2%, including $52 million or $0.36 per diluted share -- favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter was $631 million or $4.43 per diluted share, up from $394 million or $2.73 a year ago. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $817 million, including Meritor and, $85 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by higher earnings. For the full year \u201822, revenues were a record $26.2 billion or up 9% from a year ago, with sales in North America up 18% and international revenues down 2%. Currency movements negatively impacted revenues for the full year by 2%. EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% for 2022 compared to $3.5 billion of 14.7% of sales a year ago. Improvements in Components, Distribution, Power Systems and Engine margins were partially offset by increased investment in New Power and more than $100 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin some of our nonqualified benefit plans. All of that run through our operating EBITDA. All-in net earnings were $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share compared to $2.1 billion or $14.61 per diluted share a year ago. Full year cash from operations was $2 billion, down from $2.3 billion, primarily due to higher inventory levels. Capital expenditures in 2022 were $916 million, an increase of $182 million from 2021 as we continue to invest in new products and capacity expansion critical for future growth. We returned $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders or 63% of operating cash flow in the form of share repurchases and dividends last year. Now, moving on to our guidance for 2023, which includes Meritor, and thankfully, reduces the number of exclusions we'll have to explain each quarter, and I appreciate your patience as we work through that in 2022. We are excluding any separation costs associated with filtration, and for now, we're assuming that the operating results of filtration are in our guidance for the full year 2023, as the timing of that separation is not yet determined. We expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion of revenue in 2023. We currently project 2023 company revenues, including Meritor, to be up 12% to 17% and company-wide EBITDA margins expected to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.2%. In \u201823, we expect revenues for the Engine business will be flat to up 5%, driven by continued strength in North American truck market and a modest recovery in China. 2023 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5% compared to 14.4% in 2022. We expect distribution revenues this year to be up 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% compared to 10.5% in 2022. Including Meritor, we expect 2023 components revenues to increase 28% to 33% and EBITDA margins in the range of 14.1% to 14.8% compared to 15.0% in 2022. In \u201823, we also expect Power Systems revenues to be up 5% to 10% due to higher demand for oil and gas engines and power generation equipment globally. EBITDA there is projected to be between 13% and 13.7%, up from 12.2% of sales last year. And also this year, we expect New Power revenues to increase to the range of $350 million to $400 million. We expect New Power net losses to be in the range of $370 million to $390 million as we continue to make targeted investments in capacity, technology to support growing customer demand. Our goal remains to achieve breakeven EBITDA in 2027. Our effective tax rate this year is expected to be approximately 22%, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion this year. We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders over time and have accelerated cash returns to shareholders in recent years above that 50% goal when we have generated more cash than required to support our strategy. In 2023, we will prioritize cash towards dividends and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor while continuing to invest to deliver future profitable growth. Having a strong balance sheet is an important asset as we navigate through economic cycles and sustain our investments in new products for existing and new markets. To summarize, we delivered record sales, strong full year earnings in 2022, while managing through supply chain challenges and a very weak demand environment in China. As we move through 2023, demand for our products remains strong in most of our core markets with good visibility into the first half of the year. We'll continue to focus on raising margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, generating strong cash flow and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in the adoption of new technologies and penetrate new markets through our New Power business. Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it over to Chris. Yes, we've got about 2% of price cost benefit embedded in the guidance, Jerry. That's the biggest single driver of margin improvement. Yes. I think the main thing on the Engine business margins is that we haven't got building a very strong recovery in China. And then the other piece that you didn't mention, Jamie, is that we've got fairly sustained investments ahead of us over the next couple of years because we're updating several of our platforms. We've won a lot of external business, and we've got to meet future emissions regulations. So, that's the only other element that's running through the Engine business that may not be obvious from the outside, but otherwise, we'll expect them to do well if markets continue to be strong. I think it can definitely be better than that. We're still battling some inefficiencies here and there Steve. We're still expecting to have aftermarket growth over time. So no, we're not locked into these margins. I was just trying to be clear on what the underlying factors. I've seen a few comments around Engine business margins, but no, I think they can go higher. Getting China, which is the world's biggest truck market, I know the earnings come through JV, we have the lowest market in a decade. And we think we still got more share to gain there. We've got more content in the Components business. So, if I sit here today and say what could be the one thing that could move that could change our guidance most clearly, I would agree with Jen, it would be China, right now. We don't have visibility. People are more enthusiastic, but the activity hasn't yet materially picked up. So, that would be one important factor. Yes. I don't think there's anything significant in there, David. I mean, obviously, whether it's consolidated or unconsolidated, trucks probably [70%] plus when you add up all of our markets. So, the truck does better, we'll be up more than 7%. If it doesn't, we won't. I think for components, that's all consolidated revenue. That's almost entirely on-highway. It's really the engine business that has the off-highway business of any of any size. And then, yes, I think Power Systems has been pretty strong last year in China. It has probably been the exception to what we've seen in every other market. But there's no big change in dynamics. No. We did get some sizable tech fees and other things from the early part of last year, which kind of helped -- the wrong word, we were entitled to those based on product launches, but no, I don't think there's anything significant there. Right. So, I think the answer to that is, we'll need to keep working that down. I think we've got some floating rate exposure. It's not all fixed, and probably, the debt reduction will come in the second half of the year, but let me come back to you on that, David. Yes. Rob, one thing I'll add is, for the gross margin on a project basis, we're at gross margin positive last year, which is a good early indicator. We have other costs that are going in, too, for capacity expansion and other things that obviously offsets that, but it's a good indicator that we're on the right path for profitability as we move forward with more volume. I think there's a little bit of improvement baked into the guidance, but we've got a pretty strong track record of improving. There's no structural impediments to growing margins over time. It's a range. So, under the different revenue scenarios, some variation, Nicole. But over the time, we expect the margins to keep going up. I think, certainly, that's been a big factor, and we've got pretty healthy demand locked in now. So, there's been a lot of focus on that business. We've been pleased with the solid results, particularly in the second half of this year, and we just -- we've got a very, very strong focus on continuing to drive... You can roughly split our revenues 52% to 53% in the first half versus the second half, Matt. Yes. So CapEx, probably in the $100 million to $125 million range. So just under 10% of the total for the company in the New Power segment, and most -- more of that's weighted towards electrolyzers where, of course, we're ramping up production, albeit using existing Cummins sites, where possible and appropriate. And then, yes, I'd love to call the peak in New Power losses. They're going to have to peak soon because we're aiming towards breakeven in 2027 at the EBITDA level. The only caveat is, if there's a significant change, should we invest in some new capabilities that aren't part of our current portfolio? That's not part of our plan today, Noah, but that would be the only variation. No. I mean, by and large, it will go along with the revenue. Unfortunately, we had a tough Q3 in 2022. So that probably gives us the easiest comp, just kind of going through by quarter, and then we started the year much stronger. So ex-JV, I think we'll have a good first half of the year. The JV will be the biggest single swing factor. When you look at our P&L, I would think -- in the first half of the year, maybe that helps in the second. Q3 gross margins were disappointing. We've rebounded well in here in Q4. So yes, modestly expect first half to be stronger all in, unless revenues in the second half change direction significantly from what we've guided. Absolutely. Yes, we're working very hard on that. I mean personally, along with many members of the Meritor, Cummins team. So yes, and we'll talk about those as we go along, but yes, we're feeling confident about that progress towards that $130 million. We'll try and get as much as we can -- both helps the long-term interest of that business and improve the cost structure. So yes, we expect the results clearly to improve, especially in the Components segment. We're assuming that's all in for now. If we get more, then we'll be happy to report. We won't get more than $130 million, just to be clear. That's a year three number, but we're making good progress. I think you should just expect sequential improvement through the first half of the year from the Q4 levels. I think it's fair to say, it's pretty broad-based across multiple markets, broad parts of the economy. Yes, the data center gets a lot of attention. It is a significant individual segment, but we're seeing robust underlying demand for power generation across multiple segments. Well, what's happening over time is that the content is going up, right? So, one thing that's been a big positive for our business is China consistently adopting more advanced emission standards. So the amount of revenue that we're selling is going up per vehicle quite significantly over time. And certainly, cycle over cycle, it's billions of dollars of extra revenue growth a year. We're just at the lowest market in a decade. So, we agree that that growth rate is modest. We don't have any signs yet of a rapid adoption. We'll be looking at the same data you're looking at, and obviously, taken on board the feedback from our customers, but we are profitable in our operations. We don't disclose profitability by region, but for sure, when China volumes improve, our profits will go up. And I think also our footprint, our reputation for dependability, wherever our customers operate, is leading us to be approached in new segments by global large industrial players. So, it's not just in the market that we operate in today, we've been approached to expand into different market applications. That's particularly exciting."

            "name": "Jennifer Rumsey",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of 2022, discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. Last year was an incredibly exciting one for Cummins and our stakeholders. We made significant strides in our inorganic growth strategy, most notably through the acquisitions of Jacobs Vehicle Systems, Meritor and the Siemens Commercial Vehicles business. We also navigated complex global supply chain challenges, advanced our preparation for the separation of our filtration business and transition from Tom to me as the CEO. We accomplished all of this and delivered record revenues, EBITDA, and earnings per share in 2022. We did so with the focus on the exciting opportunity in front of us to lead the industry to a broader clean economy and do so in a way that is best for our stakeholders and the planet. Decarbonization is a growth opportunity for Cummins, uniting our business and climate goals. In 2022, we launched our long-term decarbonization growth strategy, Destination Zero, which includes making meaningful reductions in carbon emissions through advanced internal combustion technologies widely accepted by the market today, while continuing to invest in and advance zero emissions technologies ahead of widespread market adoption. As part of our organic growth strategy, we unveiled the industry's first unified fuel-agnostic internal combustion powertrain platforms, and we continue to see momentum in our electrolyzer technology and green hydrogen production opportunities. Demand for our products remains strong across all of our key markets and regions with the notable exception of China, resulting in strong revenues in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues totaled $7.8 billion. Excluding the Meritor business, revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $6.6 billion, an increase of 13% from the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven by increased demand in many of our North America markets. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2022 full year operational performance of our business and allow comparison to our prior guidance, I'm excluding the Meritor operating results and associated acquisition and integration costs, the costs related to the separation of the filtration business and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. Mark will provide more detail on the reported results in his comments. With these exclusions considered, EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16.1% of sales in Q4, above our guidance of 15.5% and stronger than the $705 million or 12.1% reported a year ago. EBITDA and percentage improved due to an increase in gross margins with positive pricing, higher volumes, lower product coverage costs and some improvement in logistics costs, all of which offset increases in material costs. Gross margin improvement is key to meeting our long-term goals of increasing the returns in our core business while transitioning our New Power business to break even EBITDA by 2027. In the fourth quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement, and we continue to accelerate value capture opportunities across the business. Our employees have done an excellent job in integrating the Meritor operations and people within Cummins and continue to make strides in identifying cost reduction opportunities. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the $130 million in pretax synergies we referenced upon completion of the acquisition. And in addition, we expect to deliver incremental tax synergies as we integrate the business. Excluding Meritor, 2022 revenues were a record $26.2 billion, 9% higher than 2021. Also excluding Meritor, the costs related to the planned separation of the filtration business and the impact of the indefinite suspension of our Russia operations, full year EBITDA was $4 billion or 15.1% of sales compared to $3.5 billion or 14.7% of sales in 2021. Improved volumes, better price realization and an improved supply chain environment more than offset higher compensation expenses, increased material costs and lower joint venture income for the year. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in Engine, Power Systems, Distribution and Components segments. Leading the way was the Components segment, which delivered 150 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. The Power Systems business finished 2022 with another solid quarter and delivered full year EBITDA of 12.2%, up from 11.2% last year. The improvement in performance in this segment over the past six months is encouraging, and you will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year. EBITDA margins in the distribution business increased by 110 basis points. Our reported full year 2022 results include five months of operational performance for Meritor or $1.9 billion of revenue and $26 million of EBITDA, including $115 million of acquisition, integration and purchase accounting related costs. Now, let me provide our overall outlook for 2023 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2023 guidance includes our expected results of the Meritor business and excludes the costs or benefits associated with the separation of the filtration business. We are forecasting total company revenues for 2023 to increase 12% to 17%, compared to 2022 and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales, driven by the inclusion of a full year of sales from Meritor, continued strength in the North American truck market, improved demand in power generation markets, overall pricing improvement and slow improvement in the China on-highway markets. Industry's production for heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 260,000 to 280,000 units in 2023, a range of a 5% decline to 2% improvement year-over-year. In medium-duty truck, we expect the market size to be 125,000 to 140,000 units, flat to up 10% from 2022. We expect our deliveries in North America to continue to outpace the market, as the engine partnerships we announced in 2021 continue to phase in. Our Engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 units in 2023, volume levels consistent with 2022. In China, we project total revenue including joint ventures to increase 7% in 2023. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in heavy and medium duty truck demand and 10% to 20% improvement in demand in the light duty truck market, coming off the low market levels in 2022. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 25% to 35% in 2023 as the market adjusts to new emissions regulations and digests inventory on hand. We are watching the situation in China closely, with ensuring the safety and well-being of our people as our first priority. The change in the country's COVID lockdown policy could positively impact our operations in the coming months. The current events make it difficult to gauge. The markets within China are at a low point, as we close out 2022 and our guidance assumes a slow recovery in 2023. In India, we project total revenue including joint ventures to be up 1% in 2023. We expect the industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high-horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, dependent upon the trajectory of commodity prices and supply chain improvement. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 15% to 25% in 2023, primarily driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10% to 15%, driven by increases in non-residential construction and improvements in the data center market. In New Power, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, more than doubling our 2022 revenues. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to convert to backlog and to be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, we shared that we had reached the milestone of a $100 million in electrolyzer backlog. This tripled to $300 million at the end of 2022, demonstrating the strong momentum in this market. With demand continuing to rise, we are focused on adding capacity for electrolyzer production. During 2022 we announced several capacity expansion investments and expect to have more than two gigawatts of scalable capacity in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe across Europe, North America and China. Additionally, we will continue to deliver battery, electric and fuel cell systems along with electric powertrain technologies as adoption continues in the transportation markets. As mentioned, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. We are continuing to drive improvement in our margins post-acquisition and expect Meritor to be accretive to earnings per share in 2023. We will continue to provide updates on the progress of our value capture initiatives, which will be focused on the portion of the business within our Components segment. Within Components, we expect Meritor to add $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in revenue in 2023 with EBITDA margins in the range of 10.3% to 11%, an improvement from the comparable 2022 EBITDA margin of 7.2%. The electric powertrain portion of the Meritor business has been integrated within the New Power portfolio with projected 2023 EBITDA losses of $55 million included in the overall guidance for that segment. In 2023 we anticipate that demand will remain strong in most of our key regions and markets, especially in the first half of the year. While some macroeconomic indicators have weakened in recent months, we have not seen a significant change in customer orders at this time. In summary, we expect full year sales growth of 12% to 17% and EBITDA to be 14.5% to 15.2% of sales. We have taken a number of actions to improve our EBITDA in 2023 and expect to generate very strong incremental margins within our core business and improve the margins of the Meritor business while continuing to invest in our New Power business. Having effectively managed through the challenges of the past couple years we expect improved performance in 2023 and are well positioned to invest in future growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders. Now, let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Yes. Thanks, Jerry, for the question. Yes, we are right now really focused on integrating the Meritor business, the Siemens Commercial Vehicle business and the investments that we were already making within New Power and having a number of conversations with our customers on how we bring that together to deliver those electric powertrains and components to meet their needs. So, it brings some strong products, employees as well as customer relationships, and we're seeing growing opportunities as we have relationships at a senior more strategic level with these customers to grow our business going forward. It's really early days at this point, so we'll continue to talk about that as we bring those businesses together. Great. Thanks, Jamie. Let me speak first to what we're seeing in the market. And we, of course, are paying attention to some of these macroeconomic trends. If you take just the North America truck market as a starting point, while there has been some decrease in spot rates, we still continue to see healthy freight activity and strong backlogs out through the first half, which gives us confidence that the market is going to remain strong, certainly through the first half of the year. And it's important to note, it's just not been a typical cycle for us because for the last two years, we've been undersupplying to the market demand. They've been using that equipment. We're seeing that reflected in very high aftermarket demand which continues, and these new trucks provide efficiency benefits to the fleet. So, we continue to expect strong North America truck market. In the Power Systems business, again, we have a healthy backlog of products and strong demand across many of our markets. Mining, we're forecasting to remain around flat, but growth in power generation, growth in the oil and gas business. So, we're feeling pretty confident about that as well. The biggest uncertainty is really around China. And as I said in my comments, we do project some slow recovery throughout 2023. With the lift of the stringent lockdowns that they had in the last couple of years in December, we expect that that may result in economic strengthening and certainly, less operational disruption, but we're still monitoring what happens with the COVID waves there, is there any government stimulus into the economy. We feel really well positioned there. We've launched our NS VI products, which we think will enable Cummins to grow our position in the market. We've launched the automated manual transmission there. We've got a new natural gas platform. So, we're really well positioned as China continues to strengthen and just uncertainty on exactly what the shape of that will look like. I'll let Mark talk about the margin question. Yes. We are focused on continuing to meet more stringent regulatory requirements and do so with products that will provide benefits to the environment and exceed our customer needs. We now have clarity on the EPA 2027 NOx regulations that happened late last year, and they finalize that standard at a 0.035 gram NOx. And our intention is to offer a full product lineup with our new fuel-agnostic engine platforms to meet that regulation, and we're finalizing our product plans right now with our customers on those. But we really feel well positioned to invest in really as a part of our Destination Zero strategy, reduce CO2 and NOx impact to the environment and offer products -- market-leading products to our customers with that regulation. Just on your share, we expect to continue to grow our share in the China market with the launch of the NS VI product. So, that's assumed in our guidance. Yes, the electrolyzer business is really going to drive the majority of our progress towards breakeven in \u201827 for New Power and the growth aspirations that we shared for 2030. And so, we expect during that time frame to scale up the product, the supply chain and manufacturing and continue to see growing backlog and conversion of orders into revenue. And so through that time period, you'll see margins going positive and improving, the exact margin structure of that business is still unclear. There's not a lot of suppliers in the market, and we expect demand to be quite strong through that time period. So, I'm optimistic on what margin structure for the business will look like. But, obviously, we'll share more as we get towards that breakeven point and go margin positive. I mean one of the advantages we have here is we're able to leverage our existing footprint and capability that we have as a part of the broader comment. So, you saw us announce recently, we plan to use our Fridley manufacturing facility for electrolyzer production in North America. So, we are tapping into that strength we have in our footprint and supply chain capability to help build out profitable both product as well as supply chain. And that's an advantage that I think Cummins has here. For that business, it's important to keep in mind, you see a very long -- we have a very long lead time on orders. So, as costs accelerated, it took a while for us to pass on some of the price increases to offset that, and that is in part what drove the strong margin improvement from \u201821 to \u201822. Yes. So, the fuel agnostic platform, just to clarify, that's being developed as a part of our Engine business. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll launch a full lineup in North America of that product as a part of the 27 EPA regulation. As you've seen, PACCAR is integrating and plans to introduce the natural gas version, and we have customers that are very interested in that product, including with renewable natural gas, and we announced partnerships around that. We also announced a memorandum of understanding with Tata late last year on the hydrogen version of that platform. And so really, we see a lot of interest in those platforms, both as a way to improve efficiency of diesel engines and then create flexibility to move to other fuels such as natural gas or hydrogen with the platform and really minimizing the integration pair up that's required for customers as they move between those platforms. So, we'll begin to launch those with the natural gas version here, in North America in late \u201823, early \u201824 and then accelerate introduction in the coming years after that. At a high level, the different categories of investment in New Power, of course, there's big investments happening in electrolyzers, and we talked about the growth and capacity investments that we're making there. The other buckets include investments in batteries, other electrified components in the electric powertrain and then in fuel cells. So, we're investing end of the prime mover as well as some of the key components to position ourselves as our current markets start to move to electrified powertrains to be both the powertrain provider as well as provide key components similar to the model we have today with Engine business and Components. You want to talk about allocation of investment? Yes. So, let me just reiterate the guidance that we had within the Components business. We have $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in revenue and EBITDA margins for the Meritor business, 10.3% to 11% compared to in 2022, that was 7.2%. And some of that is progress on price/cost in that business, operating efficiency as well as synergy cost savings. Yes. The power generation market really nonresidential construction as well as data centers, and despite some of the announcements that you've seen from our data center customers regarding staffing levels, they continue to show interest in investing in data centers and have demand and drive backup power -- demand on our products in that market. So, we are still quite bullish about the opportunities there for 2023. Yes. How I would describe it is, the inflation reduction act and the investments around that are really going to be key to enable the adoption rate that we anticipate is going to drive an acceleration in hydrogen investment. The details around that investment are being clarified right now. So, it's going to take several years before you really see that translate into actual projects and business. Definitely, it's going to drive growth in the hydrogen market in the U.S. between now and 2030 as that -- as those incentives come in place to both put the hydrogen production in place as well as drive adoption of some of these technologies, which today, frankly, just cost more. So, you need those incentives in order to start to drive customer adoption and bring down the costs and make them more viable in the market. I mean, in the short run, we're investing more because we're building up capacity as are others in the industry. So, the faster we go in the short run could consume more cash. But obviously, we want the market to move, and we expect to deliver good gross margins once we get this kind of investment phase. So, it could go faster. It's quite a long incubation period, so very different from, say, our on-highway engine business, while we take an order. And then typically, we're shipping in a few weeks. It's not been that typical in the last 12 months versus sometimes more than a year between headline announcements to actually putting equipment into place and sometimes even more than a year. But we are encouraged, strong adoption for our technology, and yes, business is doing well on the business development side. Yes. We talked about this in our Analyst Day about a year ago. We expect that this transition is going to take a long time for our industry, and that positions incumbents like Cummins well because you need to invest for the long term. Regardless of what our customers are adopting, we've got the solution in our portfolio. And so for sure, you see the benefit of a company like us that has a portfolio of options to meet their needs, it's going to be around for the long term and continuing to invest in some of these new technologies, be able to do that and support the product as an advantage, and it's playing out to be more of an advantage as time goes on compared to some of the new entrants. We continue to pay attention to those new entrants though and how they advance the technology and work to enter the market. So, we wouldn't discount them, but certainly, this long investment period makes it more challenging for them to stay in and be successful."

Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off. \nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you Chris and good morning. I will start with a summary of our third quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region, and I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2022. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.  Before getting into the details of our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the third quarter. On August 3rd, Cummins completed the acquisition of Meritor, a leading global supplier of drivetrain, mobility, braking, aftermarket and electric powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle and industrial markets. The integration of Meritor\u2019s people, products and capabilities in axle and brake technology will position Cummins as a leading provider of integrated powertrain solutions across the internal combustion and electric power applications. We've been excited to welcome our new colleagues into our company.  The company announced several collaborations that further enable our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals and advance our destinations Euro strategy. During the third quarter, Cummins announced collaborations with Werner Enterprises, Transport Enterprise Leasing and Versatile to deliver 15-liter hydrogen internal combustion engines when available. The X15H hydrogen engine, part of Cummins\u2019 fuel agnostic platform, will enable a more-timely solution to reduce carbon emissions by providing customers with an option that has powertrain installation commonality and end user familiarity. The New Power business continued to expand its green hydrogen presence globally as demand continues to rise in the key markets of North America, Europe, and China. Cummins announced it will expand PEM electrolyzer manufacturing capacity at its Oevel, Belgium, factory to 1 gigawatt. The company also announced it will begin producing electrolyzers in the United States, underscoring our continued dedication to advancing the nation\u2019s green hydrogen economy. Electrolyzer production will take place at our Fridley, Minnesota facility, starting at 500 megawatts of manufacturing capacity annually and scalable to 1 gigawatt in the future. In addition we continue to make progress and preparing for the separation of our filtration business. The addition of Meritor and the planned separation of the filtration business are positive mood moves for our future. However, there are upfront costs associated with both transactions, which you can see from our press release and earnings materials, heavily influenced, our reported results this quarter. We expect that the most significant costs associated with both transactions are behind us and we look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2022 and cover some of our key markets starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remained strong across all of our key markets and regions with the notable exception of China, resulting in strong revenues in the third quarter. Third quarter revenues totaled $7.3 billion. Excluding the Meritor business, third quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, an increase of 11% from the same quarter in 2021. EBITDA in the third quarter was $884 million or 12.1% of sales. Excluding the Meritor business results and the $25 million related acquisition and integration cost, EBITDA was $907 million or 13.8% of sales compared to $862 million or 14.4% of sales a year ago. Third quarter results include cost of $16 million or $0.09 per diluted share related to the planned separation of the filtration business. Adjusting for these costs, EBITDA without Meritor and filtration cost was $923 million or 14% of sales. My comments moving forward will exclude the results of Meritor, the costs associated with its acquisition and the costs associated with the expected separation of our filtration business.  Our EBITDA percentage declined in the third quarter for three main reasons; first, we saw a 32% drop in joint venture income from the third quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the slowdown in the China markets; second, we increased investments in research and development as we continued to invest in the products and technologies that will create competitive advantage in the future, particularly in the engine and new power segments; and finally, we made an investment in our people, through a one-time bonus in recognition of their intense work and commitment to meet customer demand and navigate supply chain and other challenges. This bonus did not apply to company officers. A motivated and highly effective workforce is critical to delivering our customers, executing on our strategy, and creating shareholder value. And this bonus will pay dividends over time in the retention and engagement of our people. We continue to make positive progress in improving gross margins of our business and offsetting the impact of elevated supply chain and other inflationary costs that we have experienced since the start of 2021. Gross margin percentage improved in the third quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2021, as the benefit of higher volumes and pricing exceeded the manufacturing, logistics, and material cost increases and higher product coverage costs during the quarter.  Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 19% to $4 billion driven by improved pricing, higher volumes, and higher after market demand. Industry production of heavy duty trucks in the third quarter was 64,000 units, up 23% from 2021 levels, while our heavy duty unit sales were 25,000, up 15% from 2021. Industry production of medium duty trucks was 29,000 units in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 26% from 2021 levels. While our unit sales were up 27,000, up 20% from 2021. We shipped 41,000 engines just to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the third quarter of 2022, down 4% from 2021 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 16% over 2021 due to strong capital spending by rental companies and pricing. Power Systems North America sales were up 30% compared to 2021 driven by higher volumes and strength in aftermarket. Power Systems North America industrial sales were up 122% compared to the third quarter of 2021 driven by strong oil and gas demand. North America power generation sales also increased by 10% from the third quarter of 2021. Our International revenues decreased by 1% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 18% due to lower sales and on highway and construction markets. Industry demand from medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was a 164,000 units, a decrease of 25% from 2021. Weaker new vehicle demand, contracted property investment, and economic impacts from the shutdown as the country continues to respond to the COVID-19 outbreaks have pushed the market to the lowest level in a decade instead of our projected recovery of the market in the second half of the year. Our sales in units including joint ventures were 30,000 a decrease of 27%. The light duty market in China decreased 8% from 2021 levels to 387,000 units in the third quarter while our units sold including joint ventures were 24,000, a decrease of 30%. Industry demand for excavators in the third quarter was 57,000 units, an increase of 3% from 2021 levels and our units sold were 7,800 units, a decrease of 8%. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 29% in the third quarter, due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 resurgence.  Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $614 million, an increase of 18% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 37% while our shipments increased 20%, lagging the industry production due to the lower growth in the heavy commercial vehicle segment. Demand for power generation increased in the third quarter as economic activity continued to improve, resulting in record revenue in the quarter for that market.  Now, let me provide our outlook for 2022 including some comments on individual regions and end markets. To provide clarity on our projections, we will first provide guidance excluding the results of Meritor from the acquisition date through the end of 2022. We will then provide a view of the expected Meritor results for 2022. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2022 revenue guidance of up 8% versus last year. This guidance reflects stronger performance in North America and a continued weak market outlook in China, as well as the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We are forecasting higher demand in global mining, oil and gas, and power generation markets, and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2021.  EBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15% of sales, excluding the Meritor results and costs associated with the acquisition and integration, the cost of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia and the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our filtration business. This is below our previous guidance of approximately 15.5% of sales as a result of the lower than expected market in China in the second half of 2022, and the one-time employee bonus investment made in the third quarter. This guidance reflects our expectations of increased profitability in the fourth quarter, as we continue to drive the improvements we've seen throughout the year on pricing relative to inflationary cost and improve our operating efficiency.  Based on our current forecast we expect production of heavy duty trucks in North America to be at 260,000 units in 2022, a 15% increase year-over-year. The supply chain constraints in our industry is expected to continue to limit our collective ability to fully meet the sustained strong end customer demand. In North America medium-duty truck market we are continuing to project the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. We are projecting our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat compared to 2021 consistent with prior guidance. In China we now project total revenue including joint ventures to decrease 25% to 30% in 2022, an update to our previous guidance of down 20% to 25%. We now project a 55% reduction in heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 15% to 20% reduction in demand in the light duty truck market compared to a 50% decline and 15% reduction respectively in our previous guidance. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from record levels in 2021 consistent with our prior guidance. Despite the difficult economic and market environment in China we have continued to improve our presence in the region through the down cycle and are well positioned for continued out growth across our end markets in the region. As we look ahead industry volume of NS6 products will continue to increase as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to outgrow the market and support our partners through this transition. With our NS6 share continuing to run ahead of our NS5 share. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions, as our market share increases and the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue including joint ventures to increase 15% to 20% in 2022, an improvement from our previous guidance of up 15%. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase approximately 30% in 2022. Strong performance in power generation within India is also contributing to this improved outlook.  Most major global high-horsepower markets are expected to remain strong through the end of 2022. Sales of mining engines are now expected to be up 5% compared to the prior year, an improvement from our previous guidance of flat. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 120% consistent with our prior guidance. Strong demand in the U.S. and other oil and gas markets amid energy and security has fueled this strong outlook. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10%, driven by increases in non-residential construction. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 5% driven by the increased production as supply chain constraint slightly eased and improved pricing.  We are projecting aftermarket sales to increase 15% to 20% from 2021 consistent with our previous estimate. This strong outlook is driven by parts demand within our North America On-Highway business, as well as global Power Systems markets. In New Power we expect full year sales to be approximately $180 million down from our previous guidance of $200 million due to customer scheduling and supply chain impacts. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months and we are seeing increased momentum in North America following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.  Additionally, we will continue to accelerate our collaboration with customers on both electrified power and fuel cell applications in 2022. This was demonstrated in the third quarter as we successfully launched the Cummins HD 120 fuel cell system in China by delivering 52 units to the Lin-gang Government for a bus application. For Meritor, we are expecting full year revenue since the date of acquisition to be between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. EBITDA is expected to be approximately 4.5% of sales during the same period, including the impact of required purchase accounting and integration costs. This represents the financial impact of Meritor across our Components and New Power businesses. During the quarter, we returned $245 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year.  As I sum up the third quarter, I want to emphasize that we are making progress in our strategy to lead in decarbonizing our industry. Although profitability dropped from the second quarter levels, the fundamentals of our business have not changed. Our products are performing well, leading to record demand from customers and rising market share in some of our core markets. This is the direct result of the contribution from our outstanding workforce. I do want to acknowledge the clear improvement in the financial performance of the Power Systems business this quarter, and I'm enthusiastic about the prospects for future earnings growth. We do expect total company profitability to improve in the fourth quarter from third quarter levels, as implied in our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are committed to improving the underlying financial performance of our business and delivering strong incremental margins through the remainder of 2022 and beyond. Now let me turn it over to Mark.\nMark Smith: Thank you, Jen and good morning everyone. There were a number of factors that impacted our reported results in the third quarter, and I will step through them to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the company and allow for comparison to our prior guidance. But the key takeaway I want you to leave with is that the fundamentals of our business remain strong. As you are aware, we completed the acquisition of Meritor in August and are actively working through the business integration. Our third quarter results included two months of operational performance for the Meritor business, resulting in $737 million of sales and a total EBITDA loss of $23 million, which includes both the impact of purchase accounting and acquisition and integration costs. Our third quarter results also included $16 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. To provide clarity on the operational performance of our business, excluding the acquisition in comparison to our prior guidance, I am excluding the impact of these items in my following comments. Now let me get into more detail on our third quarter performance. Revenues were $6.6 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 19% while international revenues decreased 1%, driven by the decline in China, the impact of the suspension of our operations in Russia, and the unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced our reported sales by 3%. Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $884 million or 12.1% of sales. Excluding the Meritor business results, acquisition and integration costs and the costs associated with the separation of Filtration, EBITDA was $923 million or 14% of sales for the quarter compared to $862 million or 14.4% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by an increase in engineering support, engineering spend to support new product development, weaker joint venture earnings in China and the onetime bonus to recognize the commitment of our employees. This onetime bonus totaled $56 million and impacted the reported results of all operating segments, with $41 million of those costs reported within gross margin and $15 million reported within selling, admin, and research costs. Now let me go into more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.6 billion or 24.7% of sales increased by $213 million or 100 basis points compared to last year due to the benefits from stronger volumes and higher pricing, which more than offset higher material and people costs. Selling, admin, and research expenses increased by $110 million or 13%, primarily due to higher research costs supporting the development of products critical to achieving our Destination Zero strategy, including the fuel-agnostic engine platform, battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and PEM electrolyzer technologies. Joint venture income declined by $30 million compared to last year, primarily driven by lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was $10 million, $22 million lower than a year ago, driven by $29 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our qualified benefit plans. And this compared to a gain on those investments of $1 million a year ago. Interest expense increased by $33 million due primarily to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor. Net earnings for the quarter were $468 million or $3.30 per diluted share, down from $534 million or $3.69 a year ago, with the decrease primarily attributed to an increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter. The all-in effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.7%, including $57 million or $0.40 per diluted share of unfavorable discrete items primarily related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $382 million versus $569 million in Q3 of last year. Now let me comment on the segment performance and our guidance for 2022. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues increased 8% from a year ago to $2.8 billion, and EBITDA decreased from 15.2% to 13.1% of sales as the benefits of pricing were more than offset by higher manufacturing and product coverage costs and lower joint venture income in China. For the full year 2022, we expect revenues to be up 10%, consistent with our prior guidance. EBITDA is expected to be approximately 14.25%, a decrease from our previous guidance of 14.5% due to a weaker outlook in China and the impact of the onetime employee bonus. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago to $2.2 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 10% compared to 9.8% a year ago due to pricing and stronger demand for parts, engines, and power generation equipment. We expect 2022 Distribution revenues to be up 11% compared to last year, in line with our prior guidance. EBIT is now expected to be approximately 10.5% of sales, consistent with our prior projection. Components revenue increased 10% in the third quarter, primarily driven by strong demand in North America. EBITDA increased from 14.1% of sales to 16.2% of sales, driven by the benefits of pricing actions and lower warranty expense. We expect full year revenues to increase 3% and project EBIT margins -- EBITDA margins to be approximately 16.75%, unchanged from our view three months ago. Clearly, the Components segment results are most impacted by the acquisition of Meritor, and I just want to underline that the performance excluding the addition of Meritor was exactly in line with our guidance for the quarter and for the full year. In the Power Systems segment revenues increased 16% in the third quarter to $1.3 billion, a record for the segment. EBITDA increased from 11.5% to 14.3% due to higher volumes, strong price realization, and the increased demand for aftermarket parts. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 10%, an increase from our prior guidance of up 8%. EBITDA is projected to be approximately 11.25%, also up from our prior guidance of 11%, driven by stronger price realization and continued strength in sales. In the New Power segment, revenues were $45 million, up 96% from a year ago due to stronger demand for battery electric systems. Our EBITDA loss was $86 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure, and capabilities to support strong future growth. For the full year 2022, we expect New Power revenues to be up approximately $180 million, down slightly from our prior guidance of $200 million due to delays in some customer projects and some supply chain constraints. Underlying demand, however, continues to grow for both battery electric systems and electrolyzers. Net expense for this segment is now projected to be $310 million compared to our prior guidance of $290 million, driven by increased investment to scale up electrolyzer production capacity and bring new products to market. As Jen mentioned, we are maintaining our 2022 expectations of total company revenues to be up 8%, and we now expect our EBITDA margins at approximately 15% for the full year. To be clear, once again, that this guidance excludes the Meritor business and related acquisition and integration costs, the impact of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia, and any expenses associated with preparing for the separation of the Filtration business. This guidance does imply an improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter. We expect earnings from joint ventures to decline by 25% to 30% in 2022 due to the ongoing weakness in China and the impact of suspension of our business in Russia, and that is slightly worse than our prior guidance of down 25%, all due to the conditions in China. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 22% in 2022, lots of 22s there, excluding any discrete items, an increase from our prior guidance of 21.5%. Excluding Meritor, our capital expenditures in the quarter were $179 million, up from $150 million a year ago, and we're maintaining our full year guidance for capital expenditures to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. We returned $245 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares in the third quarter, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to $1 billion year-to-date. For the full year 2022, we still anticipate returning approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And as I've already mentioned, we expect the Meritor revenues to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for the five months of this year under our ownership, and EBITDA to be approximately 4.5%, including the impact of purchase accounting. In closing, I want to again reinforce that Cummins is in a strong position, growing our leadership in our core markets while setting up the company for a stronger future through investment in new products and capabilities. And we are adjusting our portfolio of businesses, all while returning cash to shareholders. We do expect to deliver stronger profitability in the fourth quarter as implied in our full year guidance. Thank you for your guidance today -- no, your interest today. My guidance, your interest. Thank you. Now let me turn it over to Chris.\nChristopher Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are ready for our first question.\nOperator: Okay, our first question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please state your question. \nStephen Volkmann: Great. Good morning guys. Thank you. Mark, I'm interested in your guidance. Mark, you kind of have my head spinning here. I apologize for that, it's a busy day. But how are you going to report the next quarter in terms of Meritor? I assume that will be in the numbers, but you'll probably adjust out maybe the purchase accounting, I'm just trying to figure out sort of on a like-for-like basis, kind of how we're supposed to think about the next quarter?\nMark Smith: Yes, so what we're trying to do and we realize it's complex for us also, there's a lot going on, Steve. So what we're trying to do is make clear how we're performing against our guidance in the Cummins business prior to the Meritor acquisition, which we lowered that guidance just to be clear and we'll try to be clear for the reasons why. And then we'll layer on the Meritor performance. So we're trying to give projections for both. We will report all in and then just as we've done this quarter in the earnings material, we'll break out the business pre-Meritor, Meritor separately, and the different elements so you can try and get a fuller picture and then next year, we'll move to the all-in reporting. But we will continue to provide details around Meritor, so that you can gain confidence that we're making progress on executing on the integration and growth of that business going forward. So the answer is yes, it's going to look similar in Q4 to this quarter. The noise from the purchase accounting will start to go -- will taper down next quarter and in subsequent quarters. But we're going to report with and without, so we're not reducing the visibility of our performance on either front. That's the main goal.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay, all right, fair enough. Maybe just a quick switch then, we've seen a couple of months now of pretty amazing heavy truck orders in the United States, North America. And I'm curious kind of what you're hearing as you talk to customers and sort of the outlook longer term, I mean, are you guys starting to slot in deliveries for these big orders that we're seeing and just kind of any color that you can give us there would be great?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, Steve. We continue to see strong heavy-duty customer order interest. The conversations that I have with both end customers and OEMs are around how we're working through supply constraints that continue to exist and increase production rates. And this has just not been a typical cycle, so all of those fundamentals for the business remain strong. We project that the market will remain strong into next year because they've been using the trucks at a high rate. They've not been able to replace at the level that they want to. And as well, these new trucks that are coming out, new powertrains have improved efficiency and as you see higher fuel prices, that's also attractive. So we continue to watch the broader economic indicators and what that may mean over time. Right now, we're continuing to work to increase production rates and see strong underlying demand.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay, thanks. I will pass it on. Appreciate it. \nJennifer Rumsey: Thanks Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. I guess just two questions. The R&D is up considerably sequentially. So -- and I know we're continuing to invest, but I'm wondering if we should think about that as a new run rate, is R&D going to be structurally higher and sort of the implications for 2023? And I guess my same question is on the SG&A side, even if we back out the $15 million that hit SG&A because of the bonus, the onetime bonus that was also up materially .And I'm just trying to think about spend in the context of concerns on the macro, understanding your customers are still saying things are strong now, but are we taking any actions in the case the macro does weaken? Thank you. \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, great. Thanks, Jamie, for the question. Good to hear from you. We have, as you noted, taken up our R&D spend in particular in the Engine business and the New Power business where we have strategic investments in the fuel-agnostic platform and growing investments in electrolyzers and other key New Power technologies. And so we will continue to make those investments. And as we have in the past, we're going to manage through the cycles and improve performance, underlying financial performance of the company through the up and the down cycles while still making these key strategic investments that will position us to outgrow over time. We are looking closely at our priorities for next year. We are starting to more closely manage any headcount addition, so that we make sure that we're continuing to invest in key strategic areas while also managing those investments for potential downside scenarios. So we are more closely scrutinizing those priorities right now.\nMark Smith: Yes, and I would just add to that. We have lowered our admin costs like three quarters in a row. There is a tremendous focus on trying to flatten our costs out there, in particular, the increase in the SG&A was really in the selling side, which is a lot of that's tied to our aftermarket business and the Power Systems business, which is [Technical Difficulty] engineering on with the upward pressure and these are under the other type of pressure.\nJamie Cook: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob with Melius Research. Please state your question.\nRobert Wertheimer: Thanks and hello, everybody. My question would be and I'm not sure it's an easy one to answer off the cuff. But when you look at your blended pricing on engines versus the OEM pricing on trucks across your customer base or if you wanted to specify North America, do you feel like you're caught up in that regard or do you have a couple of hundred bps to catch up? And could you lay out the time frame at which you would catch up if you think you are behind the OEM prices, which have a little bit more flexibility?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, Rob, this is how I would describe it. Over -- since the start of 2021, what we've seen is supply challenges and inflation that has driven cost and inefficiency into our business. For 2022, we are expecting a 400 basis point improvement in price compared to a 230 basis point impact on cost. So we are ahead for the year when you think about that price/cost balance, and we're also working to make improvements in operating efficiency. And we continue to have work to do to get back to where we were at the start of 2021. And we're able to price more rapidly into our aftermarket business. But of course, where we've got high backlog in the Power Systems business or long-term contracts, right, that takes time to flow through as we negotiate with customers and that we have metal market and other contractual agreements that also flow through over time, but not immediately.\nMark Smith: And just to confirm, the reason -- one of the reasons why we're ahead on price and material cost this year was, in fact, we bore a lot of those costs in the second half of 2021.\nRobert Wertheimer: Are you still there, Mark?\nMark Smith: Yes, yes.\nRobert Wertheimer: Okay, sorry. Got it, got it. And then could you give a general comment on just supply chain, do you feel like we've peaked out on risk, China may be doing lockdowns again, so if you take that after globally how does the risk of upside/downside on cost and supply chain feel to you? And I'll stop there. Thanks.\nJennifer Rumsey: Sure, on the supply chain side, we continue to see improvement and we also still have issues. So at this point, electronic component continues to be our biggest risk and disruptor. But as you said, there continue to be these dynamic lockdowns in China, congestion in certain ports that is more in the East Coast, more in Europe. And so we continue to see some supply chain disruption. So from where I sit, quarter-over-quarter it's been improving and we've been taking build rates up and able to drive some operational improvement, and those issues are not completely gone. And so that is, in part, influencing this continued expectation that we'll see improvement going into Q4 and into next year.\nRobert Wertheimer: Alright, thank you. \nMark Smith: Thanks Rob. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David with Evercore. Please state your question.\nMark Smith: David, you there? \nDavid Raso: Yes, I am. Sorry about that. Just so I can understand exactly the fourth quarter, sort of what you're adding back to 3Q, can you tell us what is your implied EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter, just so I can level set?\nMark Smith: 15.5 ex Meritor.\nDavid Raso: So 15.5 for the fourth quarter?\nMark Smith: Compared to core -- yes.\nDavid Raso: Then when I think about China, obviously, it's a big driver in the EBITDA margin, just given a lot of the truck business comes in as JV income. I know the consolidated aspect of construction activity there for your business. But obviously, truck, looking forward, how should we think about what you're seeing in China just from what you normally would see around Chinese New Year, obviously, with the Congress they just had their stimulus, a lot of things going on, I'm just curious, I thought Beijing Photon, in particular, was a little weaker than I would have thought, but I'm just curious what you're seeing on the truck side in particular?\nMark Smith: No significant momentum at all there right now, Dave, so that's certainly not part of the improvement from Q3 to Q4.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, and as you noted, I mean, they just had -- the Congress elected Xi to third term. We typically see some seasonality in that market. It's difficult to predict at this point. So as Mark said, we're not projecting improvements through the end of the year.\nDavid Raso: And when it comes to the power gen business, and within that you obviously have some of the mining. Can you give us a little perspective, I mean, early look at 2023, how you're thinking about that business, just given the recent results were pretty healthy?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, like the U.S. truck market, the Power Systems markets continue to remain strong. We have -- there's a large back order there so we're projecting strength going into next year.\nDavid Raso: Thank you very much.\nMark Smith: Thanks David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning everyone. \nMark Smith: Good morning Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Hey Mark. I'm wondering if you folks can talk about, as we head into 2023, you've got a number of tailwinds in terms of electrolyzer production ramping up, the eAxles ramping up at Meritor and maybe some medium-duty engine production ramping based on your recent wins. Looking at the new product contribution 2023 versus 2022, can you just outline for us the magnitude of tailwind, it feels like the electrolyzer opportunity is tracking ahead of expectations, but maybe I can get you to expand on that, if you don't mind.\nMark Smith: What I would say is, yes, we've got line of sight into improving demand in New Power business I would expect at this point in time without getting into specific numbers, both growth in battery electric systems and electrolyzer sales next year. So I think the momentum is going to continue in New Power. And then yes, we've got strong customer demand on the eAxle side. Again, I don't think that's going to be a dramatic change relative to a $27 billion company. But demand is strong. I've got clearest visibility into the New Power side right now.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, and on the electrolyzers, as I talked about some of the investment in production capacity. So we're in the early stages of building up that production capacity, building up the backlog. It's going to be lumpy at this point, and it's going to grow, as Mark said, over time. And we still feel really good. In fact, the Inflation Reduction Act and the climate provisions around that are strengthening the hydrogen outlook in the U.S.\nJerry Revich: Super. And can I ask, the initial customer response on the Meritor integration. Can you talk about what those conversations have been like, particularly as it pertains to selling eAxle and conventional axles to traditional Cummins customers that haven't been Meritor customers? And if you could touch on within the Meritor margin guidance, what's the inventory step-up that's embedded, that's depressing results looks like by at least two points, but I'm wondering if you could outline that relative to the full year guide on Slide 14 for Meritor? Thanks.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, we're obviously in the early days of integrating the Meritor business, excited to have that as part of us, starting to have conversations with customers at a strategic level. And it's a positive for them that we have added Meritor to our portfolio and can talk about how we're serving them both in the core businesses and New Power business going forward. Early days and those conversations are both on operational and supply as well as the strategic opportunities that we have.\nMark Smith: Yes, a lot of focus on demand and delivery right now as there is in other parts of our business, Jerry. So we aren't short of demand. We need to keep raising those production rates.\nChristopher Clulow: And Jerry, on your question on the inventory step-up and there's a good reconciliation in the earnings deck, which talks through the complicated picture that is Meritor for this quarter. It's about $32 million was the impact in the third quarter of that inventory step-up.\nJerry Revich: Any in the fourth, Chris?\nChristopher Clulow: Just a small bit. Most of that inventory burns off quickly as you would expect, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Super, thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tami with J.P. Morgan. Please state your question.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So I have a couple of modeling questions. So my first question is, I saw in your presentation that Meritor's GAAP EBITDA rate I think you said, was 4.5%. And so can you help us with what it would have been on a non-GAAP basis because as we think about incorporating Meritor in our model, let's say for next year, what non-GAAP EBITDA rate should we be using and do you expect that rate to improve over the next few years just to better integrate that business?\nChristopher Clulow: Yes. So let me try to unpack that a little bit. So the U.S. GAAP results essentially for Meritor at itself was essentially breakeven in the second quarter. And as Jen mentioned, our guidance for the full year for 2022 is about 4.5%. So that implies the U.S. GAAP, when you take out -- including the purchase accounting in Q2 and a little bit in Q3, implies an EBITDA of about 9% in the fourth quarter and that was up from, if you take out some of the noise in the third quarter, that was approximately 7.3% operating EBITDA. So we're seeing a step-up there. And then we would continue to -- as we go towards the future, continue to drive improvement there, both through the synergies we gain as well as other improvements in the business. So that gives you some view of kind of the trajectory there. I'm happy to talk through more separately, if you like.\nMark Smith: But also the performance in the short run, of course, is going to be dependent on the market. And we'll give you all of those elements, both in the Q4 and as we get to next year. I realize it's messy and appreciate everyone's patience as we've tried to work out the best disclosures to give you all this information. We'll continue to err on the side of sharing more and not less to make it as clear as possible.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. That's super helpful. And another quick one from me from a modeling perspective, the bonus that you gave to employees this quarter, as we lap it next year, we should be treating it as one-off for now, right?\nMark Smith: Yes, it won't be present even in the fourth quarter results and that's one of the factors why our EBITDA margins will -- not the only factor but one of the factors why our margins will be better in the fourth quarter.\nTami Zakaria: Okay, awesome, great. Thank you so much. \nMark Smith: Thanks Tami.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven with UBS. Please state your question.\nSteven Fisher : Thanks, good morning. So lots of puts and takes, but just to kind of summarize at a high level, is the overall message that basically your power gen business is a bit better than you're expecting, China is a bit worse and the China drag is just kind of a bit bigger than you have the benefit from power gen and you have slightly higher investments in New Power, I mean, is that sort of the key summary of it of the core business? And then you gave the 15.5% margin implied for Q4. Is there any bridge you can give us from Q3 EBITDA to Q4, I know you just mentioned, obviously, the $56 million of employee costs, is there any other sort of just direct bridge you can give us to help go from Q3 to Q4?\nMark Smith: Yes, there are really three core elements to that bridge, Steve: the bonus we've mentioned, a little bit of improvement in pricing from Q3 to Q4; and then we did have some operational challenges concentrated in one or two areas and we expect those to improve. And those three elements are the key drivers of the margin rebound. No improvement in China baked in, no significant increase in expenses expected in the fourth quarter.\nSteven Fisher : Okay. And would you agree with that sort of the summary I gave of kind of what the main puts and takes of the core business were?\nMark Smith: Yes. And the only other thing is we continue to incur these mark-to-market losses so we didn't call them out. At some point, that will stabilize and rebound. Those were present in the third quarter but at a lower rate than in the second quarter. So that's noise in the other income line.\nSteven Fisher : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just in terms of the heavy-duty truck market in North America, I'm curious how much visibility you have to the second half of 2023 at this point. I know you talked earlier about the order strength. I guess I'm just curious how far into 2023 the OEMs have given you their work plans and the confidence you have there relative to the first half? Thank you. \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, I mean we are of course talking about outlook and forecast with our OEM customers and staying close to them on that. At this point, we've got about a nine-month backlog based on strong orders in September and October. And we'll continue to stay close to them to watch how that outlook evolves in the second half of the year.\nSteven Fisher : Perfect, thank you. \nMark Smith: Thanks Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt with Cowen. Please state your question.\nMatthew Elkott: Good morning, thank you. Can you just talk about the rationale behind doing a onetime bonus rather than further pay increases, I mean, is it that just you didn't want to lock in to pay increases ahead of a possible moderation of labor costs overall in the economy or did something specific happen in the quarter that made it necessary to do the bonus in order to not have a lot of attrition?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, really it was more of the latter. So of course, we're always looking at pay and what's happening with the market as it relates to labor costs. But really, we felt very strongly that given the tremendous effort of our employees over the last 18 months to deliver revenue at the level we did and work through all of the supply chain challenges and continue to commit to deliver key strategic growth initiatives, and given the environment where they are experiencing higher inflation, the impact to them, and the labor market is tighter. We felt that this onetime recognition was very appropriate to show appreciation, to mitigate attrition, and really motivate people to be connected to delivering and continuing to deliver for the company.\nMatthew Elkott: Got it, makes sense. And then just a bigger picture question. You're expecting strong demand in mining and oil and gas for the rest of the year. Does it look like this momentum should continue into 2023? And on the mining side, does it look like the -- this demand is being driven by equipment replacement, I know we had equipment replacement cycle threatening to happen for the last decade, and it's been false starts, does it look to you guys like this time, it could be a multiyear replacement cycle on the mining side?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, we do see that demand continuing into next year. Of course, in oil and gas with the energy challenges, there's a lot of demand to invest there. And we'll have to continue to monitor those economic indicators over time. But right now in both of those markets, we continue to see strong demand holding into 2023.\nMark Smith: Yes, we're pretty much sold out for this year. There are some regional factors, increased coal production in India. There's some local factors as well as the overall security and availability of energy across borders.\nMatthew Elkott: Thanks very much. \nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.\nNoah Kaye: Alright, thanks for taking my questions. Just sticking with Off-Highway first. You mentioned that it's really the engine sales to some of the construction customers in North America, that growth being driven by CAPEX from rental companies and pricing. Have you started to see any benefits kicking in from IIJA yet, is that sort of a demand tailwind for 2023 or potentially beyond?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act is going to drive investment in infrastructure to support some of these clean energy technology. So we expect, over time, we'll see increased electrolyzer demand, as I alluded to earlier, and that could also provide benefit to underlying construction demand in the U.S. It's early, right, to actually see the specific impact of that. But certainly, it should provide a positive benefit.\nNoah Kaye: Sorry, I know we've had a lot of legislation out of Washington. I was talking about the IIJA, the Infrastructure Bill.\nJennifer Rumsey: Sorry. Did I respond on the wrong one?\nNoah Kaye: Yes. It sounds you have multiple shots on goal, but just wondering if you can talk through kind of any impact from the Infrastructure Bill so far?\nChristopher Clulow: Yes, thanks, Noah. I think the Infrastructure Bill is similar -- actually it's having a very similar outcome, whereas obviously, the IRA is driving more into the New Power space. We are seeing some good momentum in that space. And we benefit that whether through the rental companies or some of the other construction equipment in North America has remained strong through this year and is carrying forward that momentum as those -- we continue to build out and there's a lot of work to be done, as you know. So that is certainly helping us.\nNoah Kaye: Okay, great. And then I know a couple of folks have asked about Meritor impact going forward for next year. So I know we won't be precise here, but just for everybody's modeling, as we think about Components margin, I mean you annualized this year 7.5% EBITDA margin, add some synergies capture and some growth, it's still going to be a margin headwind in Components of probably a couple of hundred bps, right, as we look at 2023, is that a good starting point?\nMark Smith: Yes. On a percentage basis, it's clearly going to be dilutive in the early part of the ownership and the goal is to keep working that up over time.\nNoah Kaye: And any early color on the cadence of the synergies capture that you can give us?\nMark Smith: No. I mean, we're working on that. We've got teams dedicated to that, working on that every day. Still feel confident about the numbers we gave earlier of $130 million pretax by year three. And I will say we're finding some other synergies as well in taxes and other things that are not included there. But lot of work still ahead of us, a lot of good progress to start and, of course, integrating the employees, that's a lot of work but we're off to a good start. I will say the business -- that business is also very busy with demand and supply challenges just as we are in our core. So we very much appreciate the hard work of the employees. We're listening towards driving synergies and improvement in their operations. They're all very busy and we appreciate that.\nNoah Kaye: Okay, thanks so much for the color. \nMark Smith: Thanks Noah.\nOperator: That was our final question, and that concludes the Q&A session of this call. I'll turn it back over to Chris for closing remarks.\nChristopher Clulow: Thank you, everyone -- much, everyone, for joining. As always, we will be available this afternoon to answer any questions that you may have from the Investor Relations perspective, and I appreciate your attendance today. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen and good morning everyone. There were a number of factors that impacted our reported results in the third quarter, and I will step through them to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the company and allow for comparison to our prior guidance. But the key takeaway I want you to leave with is that the fundamentals of our business remain strong. As you are aware, we completed the acquisition of Meritor in August and are actively working through the business integration. Our third quarter results included two months of operational performance for the Meritor business, resulting in $737 million of sales and a total EBITDA loss of $23 million, which includes both the impact of purchase accounting and acquisition and integration costs. Our third quarter results also included $16 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. To provide clarity on the operational performance of our business, excluding the acquisition in comparison to our prior guidance, I am excluding the impact of these items in my following comments. Now let me get into more detail on our third quarter performance. Revenues were $6.6 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 19% while international revenues decreased 1%, driven by the decline in China, the impact of the suspension of our operations in Russia, and the unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced our reported sales by 3%. Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $884 million or 12.1% of sales. Excluding the Meritor business results, acquisition and integration costs and the costs associated with the separation of Filtration, EBITDA was $923 million or 14% of sales for the quarter compared to $862 million or 14.4% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by an increase in engineering support, engineering spend to support new product development, weaker joint venture earnings in China and the onetime bonus to recognize the commitment of our employees. This onetime bonus totaled $56 million and impacted the reported results of all operating segments, with $41 million of those costs reported within gross margin and $15 million reported within selling, admin, and research costs. Now let me go into more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.6 billion or 24.7% of sales increased by $213 million or 100 basis points compared to last year due to the benefits from stronger volumes and higher pricing, which more than offset higher material and people costs. Selling, admin, and research expenses increased by $110 million or 13%, primarily due to higher research costs supporting the development of products critical to achieving our Destination Zero strategy, including the fuel-agnostic engine platform, battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and PEM electrolyzer technologies. Joint venture income declined by $30 million compared to last year, primarily driven by lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China. Other income was $10 million, $22 million lower than a year ago, driven by $29 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our qualified benefit plans. And this compared to a gain on those investments of $1 million a year ago. Interest expense increased by $33 million due primarily to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor. Net earnings for the quarter were $468 million or $3.30 per diluted share, down from $534 million or $3.69 a year ago, with the decrease primarily attributed to an increase in the effective tax rate for the quarter. The all-in effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.7%, including $57 million or $0.40 per diluted share of unfavorable discrete items primarily related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $382 million versus $569 million in Q3 of last year. Now let me comment on the segment performance and our guidance for 2022. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues increased 8% from a year ago to $2.8 billion, and EBITDA decreased from 15.2% to 13.1% of sales as the benefits of pricing were more than offset by higher manufacturing and product coverage costs and lower joint venture income in China. For the full year 2022, we expect revenues to be up 10%, consistent with our prior guidance. EBITDA is expected to be approximately 14.25%, a decrease from our previous guidance of 14.5% due to a weaker outlook in China and the impact of the onetime employee bonus. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago to $2.2 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 10% compared to 9.8% a year ago due to pricing and stronger demand for parts, engines, and power generation equipment. We expect 2022 Distribution revenues to be up 11% compared to last year, in line with our prior guidance. EBIT is now expected to be approximately 10.5% of sales, consistent with our prior projection. Components revenue increased 10% in the third quarter, primarily driven by strong demand in North America. EBITDA increased from 14.1% of sales to 16.2% of sales, driven by the benefits of pricing actions and lower warranty expense. We expect full year revenues to increase 3% and project EBIT margins -- EBITDA margins to be approximately 16.75%, unchanged from our view three months ago. Clearly, the Components segment results are most impacted by the acquisition of Meritor, and I just want to underline that the performance excluding the addition of Meritor was exactly in line with our guidance for the quarter and for the full year. In the Power Systems segment revenues increased 16% in the third quarter to $1.3 billion, a record for the segment. EBITDA increased from 11.5% to 14.3% due to higher volumes, strong price realization, and the increased demand for aftermarket parts. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 10%, an increase from our prior guidance of up 8%. EBITDA is projected to be approximately 11.25%, also up from our prior guidance of 11%, driven by stronger price realization and continued strength in sales. In the New Power segment, revenues were $45 million, up 96% from a year ago due to stronger demand for battery electric systems. Our EBITDA loss was $86 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure, and capabilities to support strong future growth. For the full year 2022, we expect New Power revenues to be up approximately $180 million, down slightly from our prior guidance of $200 million due to delays in some customer projects and some supply chain constraints. Underlying demand, however, continues to grow for both battery electric systems and electrolyzers. Net expense for this segment is now projected to be $310 million compared to our prior guidance of $290 million, driven by increased investment to scale up electrolyzer production capacity and bring new products to market. As Jen mentioned, we are maintaining our 2022 expectations of total company revenues to be up 8%, and we now expect our EBITDA margins at approximately 15% for the full year. To be clear, once again, that this guidance excludes the Meritor business and related acquisition and integration costs, the impact of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia, and any expenses associated with preparing for the separation of the Filtration business. This guidance does imply an improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter. We expect earnings from joint ventures to decline by 25% to 30% in 2022 due to the ongoing weakness in China and the impact of suspension of our business in Russia, and that is slightly worse than our prior guidance of down 25%, all due to the conditions in China. Our effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 22% in 2022, lots of 22s there, excluding any discrete items, an increase from our prior guidance of 21.5%. Excluding Meritor, our capital expenditures in the quarter were $179 million, up from $150 million a year ago, and we're maintaining our full year guidance for capital expenditures to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. We returned $245 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares in the third quarter, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to $1 billion year-to-date. For the full year 2022, we still anticipate returning approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And as I've already mentioned, we expect the Meritor revenues to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for the five months of this year under our ownership, and EBITDA to be approximately 4.5%, including the impact of purchase accounting. In closing, I want to again reinforce that Cummins is in a strong position, growing our leadership in our core markets while setting up the company for a stronger future through investment in new products and capabilities. And we are adjusting our portfolio of businesses, all while returning cash to shareholders. We do expect to deliver stronger profitability in the fourth quarter as implied in our full year guidance. Thank you for your guidance today -- no, your interest today. My guidance, your interest. Thank you. Now let me turn it over to Chris. Yes, so what we're trying to do and we realize it's complex for us also, there's a lot going on, Steve. So what we're trying to do is make clear how we're performing against our guidance in the Cummins business prior to the Meritor acquisition, which we lowered that guidance just to be clear and we'll try to be clear for the reasons why. And then we'll layer on the Meritor performance. So we're trying to give projections for both. We will report all in and then just as we've done this quarter in the earnings material, we'll break out the business pre-Meritor, Meritor separately, and the different elements so you can try and get a fuller picture and then next year, we'll move to the all-in reporting. But we will continue to provide details around Meritor, so that you can gain confidence that we're making progress on executing on the integration and growth of that business going forward. So the answer is yes, it's going to look similar in Q4 to this quarter. The noise from the purchase accounting will start to go -- will taper down next quarter and in subsequent quarters. But we're going to report with and without, so we're not reducing the visibility of our performance on either front. That's the main goal. Yes, and I would just add to that. We have lowered our admin costs like three quarters in a row. There is a tremendous focus on trying to flatten our costs out there, in particular, the increase in the SG&A was really in the selling side, which is a lot of that's tied to our aftermarket business and the Power Systems business, which is [Technical Difficulty] engineering on with the upward pressure and these are under the other type of pressure. And just to confirm, the reason -- one of the reasons why we're ahead on price and material cost this year was, in fact, we bore a lot of those costs in the second half of 2021. Yes, yes. Thanks Rob. David, you there? 15.5 ex Meritor. Compared to core -- yes. No significant momentum at all there right now, Dave, so that's certainly not part of the improvement from Q3 to Q4. Thanks David. Good morning Jerry. What I would say is, yes, we've got line of sight into improving demand in New Power business I would expect at this point in time without getting into specific numbers, both growth in battery electric systems and electrolyzer sales next year. So I think the momentum is going to continue in New Power. And then yes, we've got strong customer demand on the eAxle side. Again, I don't think that's going to be a dramatic change relative to a $27 billion company. But demand is strong. I've got clearest visibility into the New Power side right now. Yes, a lot of focus on demand and delivery right now as there is in other parts of our business, Jerry. So we aren't short of demand. We need to keep raising those production rates. But also the performance in the short run, of course, is going to be dependent on the market. And we'll give you all of those elements, both in the Q4 and as we get to next year. I realize it's messy and appreciate everyone's patience as we've tried to work out the best disclosures to give you all this information. We'll continue to err on the side of sharing more and not less to make it as clear as possible. Yes, it won't be present even in the fourth quarter results and that's one of the factors why our EBITDA margins will -- not the only factor but one of the factors why our margins will be better in the fourth quarter. Thanks Tami. Yes, there are really three core elements to that bridge, Steve: the bonus we've mentioned, a little bit of improvement in pricing from Q3 to Q4; and then we did have some operational challenges concentrated in one or two areas and we expect those to improve. And those three elements are the key drivers of the margin rebound. No improvement in China baked in, no significant increase in expenses expected in the fourth quarter. Yes. And the only other thing is we continue to incur these mark-to-market losses so we didn't call them out. At some point, that will stabilize and rebound. Those were present in the third quarter but at a lower rate than in the second quarter. So that's noise in the other income line. Thanks Steve. Yes, we're pretty much sold out for this year. There are some regional factors, increased coal production in India. There's some local factors as well as the overall security and availability of energy across borders. Yes. On a percentage basis, it's clearly going to be dilutive in the early part of the ownership and the goal is to keep working that up over time. No. I mean, we're working on that. We've got teams dedicated to that, working on that every day. Still feel confident about the numbers we gave earlier of $130 million pretax by year three. And I will say we're finding some other synergies as well in taxes and other things that are not included there. But lot of work still ahead of us, a lot of good progress to start and, of course, integrating the employees, that's a lot of work but we're off to a good start. I will say the business -- that business is also very busy with demand and supply challenges just as we are in our core. So we very much appreciate the hard work of the employees. We're listening towards driving synergies and improvement in their operations. They're all very busy and we appreciate that. Thanks Noah."

            "content": "Thank you Chris and good morning. I will start with a summary of our third quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region, and I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2022. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year.  Before getting into the details of our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the third quarter. On August 3rd, Cummins completed the acquisition of Meritor, a leading global supplier of drivetrain, mobility, braking, aftermarket and electric powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle and industrial markets. The integration of Meritor's people, products and capabilities in axle and brake technology will position Cummins as a leading provider of integrated powertrain solutions across the internal combustion and electric power applications. We've been excited to welcome our new colleagues into our company.  The company announced several collaborations that further enable our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals and advance our destinations Euro strategy. During the third quarter, Cummins announced collaborations with Werner Enterprises, Transport Enterprise Leasing and Versatile to deliver 15-liter hydrogen internal combustion engines when available. The X15H hydrogen engine, part of Cummins' fuel agnostic platform, will enable a more-timely solution to reduce carbon emissions by providing customers with an option that has powertrain installation commonality and end user familiarity. The New Power business continued to expand its green hydrogen presence globally as demand continues to rise in the key markets of North America, Europe, and China. Cummins announced it will expand PEM electrolyzer manufacturing capacity at its Oevel, Belgium, factory to 1 gigawatt. The company also announced it will begin producing electrolyzers in the United States, underscoring our continued dedication to advancing the nation's green hydrogen economy. Electrolyzer production will take place at our Fridley, Minnesota facility, starting at 500 megawatts of manufacturing capacity annually and scalable to 1 gigawatt in the future. In addition we continue to make progress and preparing for the separation of our filtration business. The addition of Meritor and the planned separation of the filtration business are positive mood moves for our future. However, there are upfront costs associated with both transactions, which you can see from our press release and earnings materials, heavily influenced, our reported results this quarter. We expect that the most significant costs associated with both transactions are behind us and we look forward to updating you on our progress in future quarters. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2022 and cover some of our key markets starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remained strong across all of our key markets and regions with the notable exception of China, resulting in strong revenues in the third quarter. Third quarter revenues totaled $7.3 billion. Excluding the Meritor business, third quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, an increase of 11% from the same quarter in 2021. EBITDA in the third quarter was $884 million or 12.1% of sales. Excluding the Meritor business results and the $25 million related acquisition and integration cost, EBITDA was $907 million or 13.8% of sales compared to $862 million or 14.4% of sales a year ago. Third quarter results include cost of $16 million or $0.09 per diluted share related to the planned separation of the filtration business. Adjusting for these costs, EBITDA without Meritor and filtration cost was $923 million or 14% of sales. My comments moving forward will exclude the results of Meritor, the costs associated with its acquisition and the costs associated with the expected separation of our filtration business.  Our EBITDA percentage declined in the third quarter for three main reasons; first, we saw a 32% drop in joint venture income from the third quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the slowdown in the China markets; second, we increased investments in research and development as we continued to invest in the products and technologies that will create competitive advantage in the future, particularly in the engine and new power segments; and finally, we made an investment in our people, through a one-time bonus in recognition of their intense work and commitment to meet customer demand and navigate supply chain and other challenges. This bonus did not apply to company officers. A motivated and highly effective workforce is critical to delivering our customers, executing on our strategy, and creating shareholder value. And this bonus will pay dividends over time in the retention and engagement of our people. We continue to make positive progress in improving gross margins of our business and offsetting the impact of elevated supply chain and other inflationary costs that we have experienced since the start of 2021. Gross margin percentage improved in the third quarter, compared to the third quarter of 2021, as the benefit of higher volumes and pricing exceeded the manufacturing, logistics, and material cost increases and higher product coverage costs during the quarter.  Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 19% to $4 billion driven by improved pricing, higher volumes, and higher after market demand. Industry production of heavy duty trucks in the third quarter was 64,000 units, up 23% from 2021 levels, while our heavy duty unit sales were 25,000, up 15% from 2021. Industry production of medium duty trucks was 29,000 units in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 26% from 2021 levels. While our unit sales were up 27,000, up 20% from 2021. We shipped 41,000 engines just to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the third quarter of 2022, down 4% from 2021 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 16% over 2021 due to strong capital spending by rental companies and pricing. Power Systems North America sales were up 30% compared to 2021 driven by higher volumes and strength in aftermarket. Power Systems North America industrial sales were up 122% compared to the third quarter of 2021 driven by strong oil and gas demand. North America power generation sales also increased by 10% from the third quarter of 2021. Our International revenues decreased by 1% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to a year ago. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 18% due to lower sales and on highway and construction markets. Industry demand from medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was a 164,000 units, a decrease of 25% from 2021. Weaker new vehicle demand, contracted property investment, and economic impacts from the shutdown as the country continues to respond to the COVID-19 outbreaks have pushed the market to the lowest level in a decade instead of our projected recovery of the market in the second half of the year. Our sales in units including joint ventures were 30,000 a decrease of 27%. The light duty market in China decreased 8% from 2021 levels to 387,000 units in the third quarter while our units sold including joint ventures were 24,000, a decrease of 30%. Industry demand for excavators in the third quarter was 57,000 units, an increase of 3% from 2021 levels and our units sold were 7,800 units, a decrease of 8%. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 29% in the third quarter, due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 resurgence.  Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $614 million, an increase of 18% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 37% while our shipments increased 20%, lagging the industry production due to the lower growth in the heavy commercial vehicle segment. Demand for power generation increased in the third quarter as economic activity continued to improve, resulting in record revenue in the quarter for that market.  Now, let me provide our outlook for 2022 including some comments on individual regions and end markets. To provide clarity on our projections, we will first provide guidance excluding the results of Meritor from the acquisition date through the end of 2022. We will then provide a view of the expected Meritor results for 2022. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2022 revenue guidance of up 8% versus last year. This guidance reflects stronger performance in North America and a continued weak market outlook in China, as well as the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We are forecasting higher demand in global mining, oil and gas, and power generation markets, and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2021.  EBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15% of sales, excluding the Meritor results and costs associated with the acquisition and integration, the cost of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia and the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our filtration business. This is below our previous guidance of approximately 15.5% of sales as a result of the lower than expected market in China in the second half of 2022, and the one-time employee bonus investment made in the third quarter. This guidance reflects our expectations of increased profitability in the fourth quarter, as we continue to drive the improvements we've seen throughout the year on pricing relative to inflationary cost and improve our operating efficiency.  Based on our current forecast we expect production of heavy duty trucks in North America to be at 260,000 units in 2022, a 15% increase year-over-year. The supply chain constraints in our industry is expected to continue to limit our collective ability to fully meet the sustained strong end customer demand. In North America medium-duty truck market we are continuing to project the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. We are projecting our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat compared to 2021 consistent with prior guidance. In China we now project total revenue including joint ventures to decrease 25% to 30% in 2022, an update to our previous guidance of down 20% to 25%. We now project a 55% reduction in heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 15% to 20% reduction in demand in the light duty truck market compared to a 50% decline and 15% reduction respectively in our previous guidance. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from record levels in 2021 consistent with our prior guidance. Despite the difficult economic and market environment in China we have continued to improve our presence in the region through the down cycle and are well positioned for continued out growth across our end markets in the region. As we look ahead industry volume of NS6 products will continue to increase as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to outgrow the market and support our partners through this transition. With our NS6 share continuing to run ahead of our NS5 share. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions, as our market share increases and the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue including joint ventures to increase 15% to 20% in 2022, an improvement from our previous guidance of up 15%. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase approximately 30% in 2022. Strong performance in power generation within India is also contributing to this improved outlook.  Most major global high-horsepower markets are expected to remain strong through the end of 2022. Sales of mining engines are now expected to be up 5% compared to the prior year, an improvement from our previous guidance of flat. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 120% consistent with our prior guidance. Strong demand in the U.S. and other oil and gas markets amid energy and security has fueled this strong outlook. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10%, driven by increases in non-residential construction. This is an increase from our prior guidance of 5% driven by the increased production as supply chain constraint slightly eased and improved pricing.  We are projecting aftermarket sales to increase 15% to 20% from 2021 consistent with our previous estimate. This strong outlook is driven by parts demand within our North America On-Highway business, as well as global Power Systems markets. In New Power we expect full year sales to be approximately $180 million down from our previous guidance of $200 million due to customer scheduling and supply chain impacts. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months and we are seeing increased momentum in North America following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.  Additionally, we will continue to accelerate our collaboration with customers on both electrified power and fuel cell applications in 2022. This was demonstrated in the third quarter as we successfully launched the Cummins HD 120 fuel cell system in China by delivering 52 units to the Lin-gang Government for a bus application. For Meritor, we are expecting full year revenue since the date of acquisition to be between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. EBITDA is expected to be approximately 4.5% of sales during the same period, including the impact of required purchase accounting and integration costs. This represents the financial impact of Meritor across our Components and New Power businesses. During the quarter, we returned $245 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year.  As I sum up the third quarter, I want to emphasize that we are making progress in our strategy to lead in decarbonizing our industry. Although profitability dropped from the second quarter levels, the fundamentals of our business have not changed. Our products are performing well, leading to record demand from customers and rising market share in some of our core markets. This is the direct result of the contribution from our outstanding workforce. I do want to acknowledge the clear improvement in the financial performance of the Power Systems business this quarter, and I'm enthusiastic about the prospects for future earnings growth. We do expect total company profitability to improve in the fourth quarter from third quarter levels, as implied in our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are committed to improving the underlying financial performance of our business and delivering strong incremental margins through the remainder of 2022 and beyond. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Yes, Steve. We continue to see strong heavy-duty customer order interest. The conversations that I have with both end customers and OEMs are around how we're working through supply constraints that continue to exist and increase production rates. And this has just not been a typical cycle, so all of those fundamentals for the business remain strong. We project that the market will remain strong into next year because they've been using the trucks at a high rate. They've not been able to replace at the level that they want to. And as well, these new trucks that are coming out, new powertrains have improved efficiency and as you see higher fuel prices, that's also attractive. So we continue to watch the broader economic indicators and what that may mean over time. Right now, we're continuing to work to increase production rates and see strong underlying demand. Thanks Steve. Yes, great. Thanks, Jamie, for the question. Good to hear from you. We have, as you noted, taken up our R&D spend in particular in the Engine business and the New Power business where we have strategic investments in the fuel-agnostic platform and growing investments in electrolyzers and other key New Power technologies. And so we will continue to make those investments. And as we have in the past, we're going to manage through the cycles and improve performance, underlying financial performance of the company through the up and the down cycles while still making these key strategic investments that will position us to outgrow over time. We are looking closely at our priorities for next year. We are starting to more closely manage any headcount addition, so that we make sure that we're continuing to invest in key strategic areas while also managing those investments for potential downside scenarios. So we are more closely scrutinizing those priorities right now. Yes, Rob, this is how I would describe it. Over -- since the start of 2021, what we've seen is supply challenges and inflation that has driven cost and inefficiency into our business. For 2022, we are expecting a 400 basis point improvement in price compared to a 230 basis point impact on cost. So we are ahead for the year when you think about that price/cost balance, and we're also working to make improvements in operating efficiency. And we continue to have work to do to get back to where we were at the start of 2021. And we're able to price more rapidly into our aftermarket business. But of course, where we've got high backlog in the Power Systems business or long-term contracts, right, that takes time to flow through as we negotiate with customers and that we have metal market and other contractual agreements that also flow through over time, but not immediately. Sure, on the supply chain side, we continue to see improvement and we also still have issues. So at this point, electronic component continues to be our biggest risk and disruptor. But as you said, there continue to be these dynamic lockdowns in China, congestion in certain ports that is more in the East Coast, more in Europe. And so we continue to see some supply chain disruption. So from where I sit, quarter-over-quarter it's been improving and we've been taking build rates up and able to drive some operational improvement, and those issues are not completely gone. And so that is, in part, influencing this continued expectation that we'll see improvement going into Q4 and into next year. Yeah, and as you noted, I mean, they just had -- the Congress elected Xi to third term. We typically see some seasonality in that market. It's difficult to predict at this point. So as Mark said, we're not projecting improvements through the end of the year. Yes, like the U.S. truck market, the Power Systems markets continue to remain strong. We have -- there's a large back order there so we're projecting strength going into next year. Yes, and on the electrolyzers, as I talked about some of the investment in production capacity. So we're in the early stages of building up that production capacity, building up the backlog. It's going to be lumpy at this point, and it's going to grow, as Mark said, over time. And we still feel really good. In fact, the Inflation Reduction Act and the climate provisions around that are strengthening the hydrogen outlook in the U.S. Yes, we're obviously in the early days of integrating the Meritor business, excited to have that as part of us, starting to have conversations with customers at a strategic level. And it's a positive for them that we have added Meritor to our portfolio and can talk about how we're serving them both in the core businesses and New Power business going forward. Early days and those conversations are both on operational and supply as well as the strategic opportunities that we have. Yes, I mean we are of course talking about outlook and forecast with our OEM customers and staying close to them on that. At this point, we've got about a nine-month backlog based on strong orders in September and October. And we'll continue to stay close to them to watch how that outlook evolves in the second half of the year. Yes, really it was more of the latter. So of course, we're always looking at pay and what's happening with the market as it relates to labor costs. But really, we felt very strongly that given the tremendous effort of our employees over the last 18 months to deliver revenue at the level we did and work through all of the supply chain challenges and continue to commit to deliver key strategic growth initiatives, and given the environment where they are experiencing higher inflation, the impact to them, and the labor market is tighter. We felt that this onetime recognition was very appropriate to show appreciation, to mitigate attrition, and really motivate people to be connected to delivering and continuing to deliver for the company. Yes, we do see that demand continuing into next year. Of course, in oil and gas with the energy challenges, there's a lot of demand to invest there. And we'll have to continue to monitor those economic indicators over time. But right now in both of those markets, we continue to see strong demand holding into 2023. Thank you. Yes. I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act is going to drive investment in infrastructure to support some of these clean energy technology. So we expect, over time, we'll see increased electrolyzer demand, as I alluded to earlier, and that could also provide benefit to underlying construction demand in the U.S. It's early, right, to actually see the specific impact of that. But certainly, it should provide a positive benefit. Sorry. Did I respond on the wrong one?"

With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Executive Chairman, Tom Linebarger one more time. Thanks.\nThomas Linebarger: Thank you, Chris. Brilliant. Good morning, everybody. I just -- I had to start by telling you about some rough math I did before I walked in today. And I believe this is my 70th earnings call. It's also going to be my last. I'm very grateful to the analysts and investors who are part of this journey with me. Many of you help me better understand the perspective of our shareholders, which influenced how we ran the company, how we developed our strategies and priorities, and how we communicated about our results and plans for the future. I always try to ensure that the senior leaders in the company understood your views and perspectives, and they understood who they were really working for. Some of you have been at this work almost as long as I have, and your commitment to understanding our company and its potential has been remarkable. I just want you to know that it meant a lot to me.  I'm very proud to have served as the CEO for this company for 10 years, as a senior executive for more than 20 years. It was an honor and a privilege. This company stands for more than its products and technology, its revenue or its earnings, and even its performance for customers all over the world. The people that work here are exceptional humans, not just exceptional workers. That's why this transition was so important to me. It is perhaps the most important work of my entire career. And I have a smile a mile wide today because of the quality of the individual that replaces me and the strength of the team beneath her.  Jennifer Rumsey is a once in a generation leader. She combines the leadership and technical skills needed, with the characters and values required and the inspiration of a CEO that can take this company to places where I could not. I'm as proud as I was on the day I took the job to see her succeed me. Jen?\nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Tom. Good morning. I'm excited to join you this morning in this new capacity as President and CEO for Cummins. In July, we announced that Tom would end his term as CEO effective August 1. It is a bittersweet moment for me as he's been one of the most significant influences in my career and leadership. Tom has been an incredible leader for this company and a true partner and coach to me. Because of his leadership, we are in a strong position to navigate what comes next and execute our Destination Zero strategy. Tom and I share a common vision for Cummins and the role that our company plays empowering a more prosperous world. I feel deeply honored and proud to serve as the new CEO of Cummins, the first woman and just the seventh CEO of this great company. My life and leadership have prepared me for this role at this moment during the critical period for Cummins and our planet. A focus on purpose, people and impact has shaped my career and will influence how I lead. I look forward to working with all of you as we move forward.  I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. And I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2022. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the detail on our performance, I wanted to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the second quarter. The company achieved significant milestones related to 2 previously announced acquisitions: Jacobs Vehicle Systems, or JVS, and Meritor. In April, Cummins completed the acquisition of JVS, adding engine braking, cylinder deactivation, start-stop control and thermal management technologies, which are key components to meeting current and future emissions regulations. On May 26, Meritor's shareholders voted in favor of the Cummins acquisition bid, further validating the potential of what Cummins and Meritor can achieve together. The companies are working together to complete the acquisition this week as we have received all regulatory approvals to close the transaction.  During the second quarter, Cummins announced collaborations with Daimler Truck, North America and Scania to deliver fuel cell electric powertrains for heavy-duty truck applications and with Komatsu on development of zero-emission haulage equipment, including hydrogen fuel cell solutions for large mining haul truck applications. Cummins, Chevron and Walmart also share plans to integrate Cummins X15N natural gas engines, powered by renewable natural gas into Walmart's heavy-duty truck fleet.  These customer collaborations are significant steps in alignment with our Destination Zero strategy to evolve our company, our products and our customers' products to the technologies needed for a decarbonized world. This strategy, which represents a significant growth opportunity for Cummins, includes reducing carbon emissions now by making improvements in engine-based solutions that are broadly available today while rapidly advancing the 0 emissions technologies of the future.  We continue to focus on our people and their development as a strategic advantage for the company. In the second quarter, the company posted its first human capital management report, detailing our commitment to creating and maintaining a dynamic and exciting work environment for our employees.  Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2022 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remained strong across all of our key markets and regions, with the notable exception of China, resulting in record revenues in the second quarter. Revenues for the second quarter of 2022 were $6.6 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the second quarter of 2021. EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16% compared to $974 million or 15.9% a year ago. Second quarter results included costs of $29 million related to the preparations for the separation of the Filtration business.  As discussed previously, we recorded a charge of $158 million in the first quarter related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. In the second quarter, received certain inventory and other expense amounts reserved previously and incurred some small additional charges, resulting in a net recovery of $47 million. Adjusting for these items, EBITDA was $1 billion or 15.7% of sales. My comments moving forward will exclude the financial impact of the suspension of our Russia operations and the costs associated with the separation of our Filtration business.  EBITDA percentage declined in the second quarter as strength in sales and increased gross margin were offset by a 31% drop in joint venture income from the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the slowdown in China markets. Research and development expenses also increased slightly in the second quarter of 2022 as we continued to invest in products and technologies that will create advantage in the future, particularly in the engine and new power segment. Gross margin percentage improved compared to second quarter of 2021 as the benefit of pricing and higher volumes exceeded the manufacturing, logistics and materials cost increases during the quarter. This pricing only partially offset the impact of elevated supply chain and other inflationary costs that we carried through from 2021 and experienced in the first half of 2022. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 15% to $4 billion, driven by improved pricing, higher volumes and higher aftermarket demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 62,000 units, up 9% from 2021 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 26,000, up 12% from 2021. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 30,000 units in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 5% from the 2021 levels, while our unit sales were 27,000, up 21% from 2021. We shipped 38,000 engines to [indiscernible] for the use on the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2022, down 9% from 2021 levels due to supply chain issues, which temporarily limited truck production. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 9% as other companies maintained strong capital spending.  Power Systems North America sales were flat compared to 2021 as strength in aftermarket offset lower volumes. Demand remains high in North America markets for Power Systems, but revenues for North America power generation declined by 3% as supply chain constraints limited our production for both U.S. military and mobile power applications. Our international revenues decreased by 2% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a year ago. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 43% due to lower sales in the on-highway and construction markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 173,000 units, a decrease of 70% from 2021. Last year's numbers were strong, supported by a prebuy ahead of NS VI. But weaker new vehicle demand and economic impacts from shutdowns as the country is responding to a COVID-19 resurgence have pushed the market to the lowest level since 2007.  Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 25,000, a decrease of 70% despite the very difficult environment in China. We did see growth in some of our power systems markets, particularly mining and oil and gas. The light-duty market in China decreased 38% from 2021 levels to 380,000 units. While our units sold, including joint ventures, were 23,000, a decrease of 40%. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 66,000 units, a decrease of 32% from 2021 levels. The decrease was driven by declining demand within the property market and the COVID-19 impact on infrastructure demand. Our units sold were 9,900 units, a decrease of 41%. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 5% in the second quarter due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 resurgence.  Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were a record $594 million, an increase of 51% from the second quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 131%, while our shipments increased 78%, lagging the industry production due to lower growth in the heavy commercial vehicle segment. The high level of growth in the second quarter is coming off a very low base when India was experiencing a COVID-19 peak in 2021. Demand for power generation and construction equipment increased in the second quarter as economic activity continued to improve. In Brazil, our revenue increased 7%, driven by improved demand in most end markets.  Now let me provide our outlook for 2022, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2022 revenue guidance of up 8% versus last year. This guidance reflects stronger performance in North America and a weaker market outlook in China as well as the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We are forecasting higher demand in global oil and gas and power generation markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2021. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 250,000 units to 260,000 units in 2022, a 10% to 15% increase over a year ago. The supply chain constraints our industry is experiencing continue to limit our collective ability to fully meet strong end customer demand. In North America medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. We are now projecting our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat compared to 2021, an update to our previous guidance down 5%. In China, we are now projecting total revenue, including joint ventures, to decrease 20% to 25% in 2022, an update to our previous guidance of down 10%. We now project a 50% reduction in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 15% reduction in demand for the light-duty truck market compared to a 40% decline and a 12% reduction, respectively, in our previous guidance. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from record levels in 2021, consistent with our prior guidance.  Despite the difficult economic and market environment in China, we have significantly improved our presence and profitability in the region compared to private -- prior cycles and are well positioned for continued outgrowth across our end markets in the region. As an illustration from 2019 to 2022, the demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks is projected to be down 40%, while across the same period, we are forecasting an increase in earnings from joint ventures in China.  As we look ahead, industry volume of NF VI product will increase through 2022 as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to continue to outgrow the market and support our partners through this transition. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions as our market share increases and the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to increase 15% in 2022, an improvement from our previous guidance of up 10%. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase approximately 30% in 2022.  We continue to project most major global high horsepower markets will improve in 2022. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat in 2022 compared to the prior year, consistent with previous guidance. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 120%, an update from our previous guidance of up 95%. Strong demand in the U.S. and other oil and gas markets have fueled this improved outlook.  Revenue in global power generation markets are expected to increase 5%, driven by increases in nonresidential construction, consistent with our prior guidance. We are now projecting aftermarket sales to increase 15% to 20% from 2021, an improvement from our previous estimate of up 15%. This is driven by parts demand within our North America On-Highway business as well as global Power Systems markets.  In New Power, we continue to expect full year sales to be approximately $200 million. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers, which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. Additionally, we will continue to accelerate our collaboration with OEMs on both electrified power and fuel cells for applications in 2022 as highlighted by the announcements I noted previously.  We are maintaining our full year 2022 EBITDA guidance of approximately 15.5%, excluding the impacts of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia, the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our filtration business and the expected costs associated with the pending acquisition of Meritor. We expect to deliver the strong profitability despite the supply chain constraints and rising inflationary costs that we are experiencing. During the quarter, we returned $240 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. Strong execution resulted in record sales in the quarter despite very difficult operating environment. The ongoing supply chain constraints and rising costs throughout the industry, continued COVID-19-related impacts and the effect of the conflict in Ukraine all present challenges to operating our business.  I am grateful for the commitment of our employees across the organization who have worked tirelessly to overcome these challenges. Their efforts resulted in a strong quarter, enabling us to support our customers while generating solid returns.  Cummins is in an excellent position to continue to execute our Destination Zero strategy, invest in the products and technologies that will fund future growth and drive advantage for our customers. We will accomplish this while generating strong financial results and meeting our commitment to return cash to shareholders. It's an exciting time to become CEO.  Thank you for joining us today. Now let me turn it over to Mark.\nMark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the second quarter, especially in the context of a challenging global business environment. As Jen mentioned, our second quarter results included a $47 million benefit from adjusting the reserves related to the suspension of our operations in Russia and $29 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business.  To provide clarity on operational performance, I'm going to exclude the impact of these items in my comments. We have provided a breakdown of the costs associated with Russia and the filtration separation costs by line item and by segment in our earnings material to help you understand the underlying performance more clearly.  Now let me go into more details on the second quarter performance. Second quarter revenues of $6.6 billion were up 8% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 15%, while international revenues declined by 2% due to a sharp slowdown in China. Foreign currency fluctuations, primarily a stronger U.S. dollar, reduced sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1 billion or 15.7% of sales for the quarter compared to $974 million or 15.9% a year ago. The lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by negative other income and lower joint venture earnings in China. Gross margins improved year-over-year and from the first quarter.  Now let me go into more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.7 billion or 25.6% of sales increased by $208 million or 140 basis points. The benefits of stronger volumes and higher pricing more than offset higher freight and material costs for this quarter. Of course, we have been facing increased costs for an extended period of time. And now our gross margins have returned back to 2019 of pre-COVID levels. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $16 million or 2%, primarily due to higher research costs supporting future growth, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.  Joint venture income declined by $42 million versus a year ago. Lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China was the primary driver of the decline in earnings. Other income was a negative $18 million, $87 million worse than a year ago. We experienced $48 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our unqualified benefit plans in the second quarter, and this compares to gains of $20 million a year ago. This variation in this one category explains most of the change in other income.  Net earnings for the quarter were $678 million or $4.77 per diluted share compared to $600 million or $4.10 from a year ago. The earnings per share increased due to higher earnings, lower taxes and a reduced share count resulting from share repurchase activity. The all-in effective tax rate in the second quarter was 17.3%, including $36 million or $0.25 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $599 million compared to $616 million a year ago.  I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2022. For the Engine segment, second quarter revenues increased 11% from a year ago, while EBITDA decreased from 16.1% of sales to 15.2% of sales, as the benefits of stronger volumes and pricing actions in our consolidated earnings were more than offset by lower joint venture income in China. In 2022, we expect the revenues to be up 10%, up 2% from our prior guidance. The increase in sales primarily driven by higher demand for engines and parts in North America. 2022 EBITDA is projected to be approximately 14.5%, in line with our prior guidance.  In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 17% from a year ago to $2.3 billion, a record quarter for the segment. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 11.2% compared to 10.5% sales a year ago, primarily due to stronger parts, whole goods, and sales and pricing actions. We expect 2022 Distribution revenues to be up 11% year-over-year and EBITDA margins in the range of 10.5% of sales, both in line with our prior guidance.  Components segment revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter, primarily driven by weaker demand in China. EBITDA increased from 15.1% of sales to 18.2% of sales, driven by the benefits of pricing actions which offset material cost increases and lower warranty expense. We expect revenues to increase 3% for the year, down from an increase of 6% in our prior guidance, primarily to a lower outlook in China. EBITDA margin is expected to be 16.75% of sales, in line with our prior guidance.  In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 5% and EBITDA decreased from 12.2% to 10.6% of sales, as the benefit of stronger volumes and pricing were more than offset by higher material and logistics expenses. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 8% and EBITDA is projected to be approximately 11% for Power Systems, unchanged from our prior year guidance.  In the New Power segment, revenues were $42 million, up 75% from a year ago due to stronger demand for battery electric systems. Our EBITDA loss was $80 million in the quarter, as we continue to invest in the products infrastructure and capabilities to support future growth and was in line with our expectations. In 2022, we still expect revenues for the New Power business to be approximately $200 million, up 72%. And net EBITDA losses are still expected to be in the range of $290 million for New Power, also unchanged from our prior guidance.  As Jen mentioned, we are maintaining our '22 expectations of company revenues to be up 8% and our EBITDA margins of approximately 15.5% of sales. This guidance excludes expenses outside of the normal course of business associated with the separation of the Filtration business, the pending acquisition of Meritor or the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We expect earnings from joint ventures to decline 25% in 2022, excluding the impact of suspension of our business in Russia. And this is down from our prior guide of a decline of 20% due to continued weakness -- or further weakness, in fact, in the China truck market. We are projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.5% for this year, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures were $147 million in the quarter, up from $125 million a year ago. We still expect that our full year capital investments will be in the range of $850 million to $900 million.  We returned $240 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares in the second quarter, bringing our total cash returns of $758 million for the first half of the year. We still anticipate returning approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. While high inflation and rising global interest rates present risks to global economic growth, we did not experience any significant changes in aggregate demand from our customers over the past quarter. Our focus remains on raising financial performance cycle-over-cycle in our core business, while investing in technologies that will deliver future profitable growth, including in new markets, new applications and with new customers.  We continue to advance our strategy in the second quarter, delivered record quarterly revenues and earnings per share, and recently announced an 8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, the 13th straight year of dividend increases.  Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.\nChristopher Clulow: Thank you, Mark. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Tom and Jen, congratulations.\nJennifer Rumsey: Thanks, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: So Tom, over those 70 earnings calls, I just want to add some rough math, too. So the earnings power of Cummins is up about sevenfold. So congratulations to you and the team here.\nThomas Linebarger: Thank you, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering if you could just talk about the supply chain environment. You folks are sending a lot more via airfreight than you do in a normal environment. I'm wondering if you could just flesh that out for us. What proportion of your shipments are now airfreight versus in a normal environment? And how should we think about, whenever demand does slow, what decremental margins might look like given the step down that we see in expedited freight in that environment?\nJennifer Rumsey: Great. Thanks, Jerry. Yes, we continue to experience an environment where supply chain is limiting our production in most of our markets. And as you've seen, the team here has worked really hard to navigate that and continue to deliver as much product as we can to our customers who are also experiencing issues.  Some of those issues have lessened. We continue however to experience constraints, in particular, in the electronics space, microprocessors and other electronic components. We've seen improvement in our premium freight and also are closely monitoring what's going on with the standard freight rates. So while we have some improvement off the peak, we're still running at high levels as we continue to navigate disruptions caused by a combination of supply constraints and COVID-related disruptions.\nJerry Revich: I was just going to ask you if it's possible to quantify how much higher than is the normal?\nMark Smith: Well, at one point, last year, we were running probably 4x the normal level of premium freight, and that's come down. It has been that we've seen sequential improvement over the last 3 or 4 quarters, but we're still running 2x to 3x kind of extra costs right now. And then you'd asked about decremental margins, Jerry, in the event there's a slowdown. What I would say to you is we have to embrace these cycles when they come. We have a very experienced team that's navigated through several of them. I'm very proud of our record of raising cycle-over-cycle performance at the peak and trough. I can't give you exact decremental margins, but know that we will adjust plan outcome to operate the wells to continue to as and when the next cycle comes. That's all I can say really at this point.\nJerry Revich: Got it. And just lastly, normally, your margins tend to be down in the third quarter versus second quarter seasonally. I'm wondering given the supply chain, the dynamic that we have here, could we actually see margins flat up for you folks sequentially depending on how supply chain performs?\nMark Smith: I think the biggest challenge in the second half -- well, it's baked into our guidance, is that we see a drop-off in earnings in China. We typically see about a 25% to 30% lower JV income in the second half of the year, and we're projecting that again. You've heard from some of our important customers what their trajectory looks like on the top line going into the third quarter. Yes, there's still a lot of moving parts, still a lot of challenges we're working through. We've maintained our full year guidance. We're slightly behind the EBITDA percent for the full year through the first half of the year, but we're on track, not expecting extraordinary variation, at least from what we know today.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tim Thein with Citigroup.\nTimothy Thein: Yes. Tom and Jen, congrats to you both. Yes. And Tom, I trust you'll be dialing into that 71st call, just so you can hear Chris read through the legal disclaimer.\nThomas Linebarger: No question about it.\nTimothy Thein: Yes. So yes, Tom, maybe one for you, just higher level. Obviously, you've observed a number of cycles during your time. And I'm just curious, you mentioned that you guys weren't seeing anything of note. But obviously, there's a lot of broader concerns regarding the potential for either a recession is here or on our doorstep. And I'm just curious, if you have conversations with customers, what would you be alerting the team for in terms of signposts or indications of -- if that begins to, in fact, come through, where would you be watching? And what kind of, again, signals would you be kind of leading the team for?\nThomas Linebarger: Thanks, Tim. And I have been through a lot of these, and this is an unusual one, there's no question about it. But I'm going to flip it back to Jen just because in terms of conversations with customers about where they are, Jen's actually been doing more of those than I have. But I would say that -- I just kind of repeat the point Mark made. It is an unusual period and it has been an unusual cycle. And I think our team has continued to figure out ways to adapt to it, and I think we will here too. But make no mistake, a lot of us in the industry are trying to figure things out that we haven't faced before, labor shortages, part shortages over extended periods and things like that, I think you've heard from Jen. But let me just turn it back to her for kind of your perspective, Jen, of the customers and what they're looking at.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great, great. Thanks, Tom. As Mark and Tom have said, we're in a cyclical business. We have a strong team that understands how to navigate and manage over the cycles and use the cycles to strengthen the business and emerge stronger. And this is not a typical cycle because, coming out of the COVID-19 -- early part of COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen really strong demand that has been constrained by supply chain constraints across the industry. And we have been unable to meet our collective customer demand in these markets outside of China. That have been strong now for 18 months. You see that showing up in very high aftermarket demand as well as customers have been using these products heavily and had higher parts demand as they worked to keep them running.  So despite the fact that we do see some decrease in spot rates, some reduction off of really high indicators, when I talk to customers and look at some of these backlogs and freight activity, it's still very strong. And they still would like us to supply more than we're able to. So the conversations are all focused on where are we at with supply constraints and can we ship more to them. We continue to monitor those overall indicators. At this point, end customer demand is strong. Aftermarket demand is strong. Used truck prices continue to be elevated. And also recall, with higher fuel prices, these more fuel-efficient, next-generation products are attractive to customers. And so we'll continue to stay close to it and monitor what happens. But right now, we see supply being the constraint through this year outside of China.\nOperator: Our next question is with Jamie Cook with Credit Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJamie Cook: Congrats, Jennifer. And congrats, Tom, and thank you for all the support throughout the years. I wish you well. And I'm sure you're going to miss all our very insightful questions on earnings calls. I guess, Jennifer, my first question for you, understanding that you and Tom have been working closely together, and you co the Destination Zero strategy. You both obviously worked closely with and have buy-in. But sort of every CEO puts their own sort of stamp on a company. So just sort of -- as you're thinking about leading the company, sort of maybe nuances or differences relative to Tom or how you're thinking about the company just slightly differently? And then I guess just my second question, and I'll -- Jennifer, this is for you or for Mark. It's probably unfair, but I'll ask it anyway. Understanding you can't control a downturn if we have one, but I feel like Cummins' downturn theoretically in 2023 could be different as you think about, one, we have -- we're adding Meritor, you have market share wins. I guess we won't have the Filtration business. And maybe China is actually okay in this downturn because we're still -- the markets are depressed. So any way you want to sort of put buckets around how that could be additive to a normal downturn? Sorry for an unfair first question, Jennifer.\nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Jamie. Appreciate the question. And as you noted, Tom and I have developed the Destination Zero strategy together. I've been a member of the Cummins leadership team now for more than 7 years as Chief Technical Officer, leading the Components business, Chief Operating Officer, and now CEO. So the strategy, the focus of the company going forward remains the same. The commitment to all of our stakeholders to deliver strong results, to really create strategic advantage to our people will continue.  I think the big difference is just that, as we continue to operate in this evolving environment, paying attention to how markets are evolving, technologies are evolving, integration of Meritor, major new company, I'm going to be thinking a lot about strategic execution, and what does that mean for different parts of our business as our strategy evolves and paying attention to a more dynamic environment. And that's one of the reasons why I've kept the President role in addition to CEO is to stay close to the businesses as we focus not only on continuing to refine that strategy, but really driving strategic execution and delivering results.  As it relates to next year, we'll, of course, talk later more about next year. You've heard us say we see supply being the limiting factor through this year. Backlog is strong. China is down, and will improve, right? There's a lot of opportunity to improve. And Cummins is very well positioned. Our products are performing very well. The customer demand for that product is strong. We have new partnership opportunities in the core business and in New Power. And we'll continue to invest in products that will position the company for the future and manage through the cycles as they come.\nThomas Linebarger: And by the way, I'll miss you, Jamie.\nJamie Cook: No. I mean, that's fine. I was just wondering, too, I mean, the incremental market brings more opportunities and also the Meritor, some of these market share wins start to help in 2023? If you want to answer, fine, if not, that's fine. I can get back in queue.\nMark Smith: I think you just described most of my work plan from Tom, we'll be working on all of those. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS.\nSteven Fisher: Not sure if I missed this, but what was your first half aftermarket growth? I know you raised the full year of 15% to 20% from 15%. Just kind of wondering what you're assuming for kind of the second half trajectory within that guidance if some of the market activity is kind of slowing that down at all?\nChristopher Clulow: Yes. Steve, it's Chris. Yes, we experienced about that same level in the first half, and we expect it to hold throughout the year. I think the demand is still very high, particularly in the heavy-duty market, in North America as well as the global Power Systems markets. Mining, oil and gas have strong demands there for aftermarket parts, rebuilds and whatnot. So we expect that to hold certainly through the remainder of 2022.\nMark Smith: Yes. Q2 was a little stronger than Q1. As Tom and Jen mentioned, there have been some supply chain challenges. So these are little bit, and demand remains strong.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. And then as you're kind of discussing with Tim before, I mean, it seems like we're kind of in this broad macro limbo at the moment. I guess I'm just curious how that is affecting any of your investment plans or strategic actions, if that's changing the timing of anything?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Good question. So obviously, we've moved forward with our JBS acquisition and Meritor will complete this week. We're continuing to make these key investments in the future. And we are still in the process on the separation of our Filtration business as we've disclosed previously and monitoring the environment as that continues.\nMark Smith: And the other thing I'd add is, we're just -- as you'd imagine, we're not just waiting around for changing economic conditions. An important part of how we've grown the earnings over time is just like a continual focus on trying to drive efficiencies in everything that we do. Doesn't always make the headlines, but almost every aspect of our work, we're looking for efficiency, better output. So we're always looking for those types of ways to improve the underlying performance of the business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRobert Wertheimer: Congrats to both of you. My question is really on New Power. There's a lot that's changed in the world in the last 6 months. Your revenue trends are pretty good. And I'm curious if you have any comments on competitive position within electrolyzers, whether you see it solidifying or expanding. You guys have the wherewithal to invest, and presumably, that pays off somehow. And then just whether the outlook into, I guess, '23, '24, I'm not sure how far along your backlog extends is inflecting upwards as the world reevaluate its energy mix?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, yes. Great question. So we did -- we delivered the highest revenue in the second quarter to date from our New Power business at $42 million and made a lot of progress across all parts of the business. So you saw announcements of new partnerships on fuel cells, both on and off-highway, where we think long term the market will move. Continuing to make progress and having lots of conversations on the electrolyzers and demonstrating the capability of our PEM electrolyzer solutions there. And we believe, as we demonstrate some of those larger installations of PEM electrolyzer, that the market's going to increasingly move towards that solution and that we're well positioned competitively.  The market is lumpy at this point. And a lot of our focus is on building up capacity and scale to meet the demand. And so we will -- Amy and I will continue to be talking about what are those key milestones that we see in the market and in our scale-up activity and how that's evolving. We still feel very optimistic. And with this energy challenge that we see in the global world, expect that the focus and interest in green hydrogen will continue to grow.  And lastly, with the Meritor acquisition, that's another key component that we think positions us well in the electric powertrain. And we'll be building on the business that we have and very complementary to our existing New Power business and electrified powertrain. So overall, well positioned for the future with New Power.\nRobert Wertheimer: That's comprehensive answer. Any inside track on whether the Inflation Reduction Act gets passed? And then you would benefit obviously from green hydrogen with that. I don't know if there's any production or any other obvious benefits that you saw in that potential bill, and I will stop there.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great. So we're hopeful that the Inflation Reduction Act will get passed. It has many key provisions that we think are important for advancing lower carbon solutions, and it fits well with our Destination Zero strategy. It's really critical that there's investment to build out infrastructure and to make these technologies more affordable as they scale in advance. So we are -- have been active and advocating for some of the key energy provisions in that act, and we'll continue to do that as our Congress considers it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Elkott with Cowen.\nMatthew Elkott: So after the initial COVID shutdowns in China, we saw a pretty record recovery in the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. I understand we're highly unlikely to see anything like that after the current lockdowns. But do you have any sense of how things could play out when or if China moves fully past lockdowns like most of the rest of the world has?  And a longer picture question related to China as a follow-up. You've seen some western companies, like some automakers reconsider JVs in China. Do you guys still see your JV model in China as the right strategy? Any updated thoughts on that would be appreciated.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. What happens with China COVID lockdowns is one of the big questions that we debate a lot. At this point, they continue to have this dynamic lockdown strategy. And we've continued to see some smaller scale lockdowns that have been happening and operating and kind of closed loop, closed circle environments within that from a business perspective. So I don't see when and how they completely evolve out of that. We're prepared to continue to operate in that type of environment. However, we do think that, that market is going to come back. It's a large market. It's an important market for us to be a part of because of its size. And we are committed to continuing to invest in the products and joint ventures that we have there, while also ensuring from a global supply chain perspective that we have resiliency in our supply chain so that we can navigate through COVID, weather disruptions and other constraints.\nOperator: Our next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: And let me add to the congratulations here. And I just want to follow up on the IRA. So obviously, there's a lot of potential benefits for Cummins in this legislation. But among them, you could be looking at up to a $3 per kg production tax credit for green hydrogen. And obviously, it has been kind of on again, off again for the last couple of years. I have to imagine that some scenario planning has played out in some of these potential customer discussions. So at this point, is it possible to actually dimension the magnitude of the opportunities domestically that might pencil out with that kind of a PTC? And then how quickly do you think you can move to convert those opportunities to revenue if it does come to pass?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. No. It's a great question. And within that, Inflation Reduction Act, as you noted, there is incentive for hydrogen production, which is significant, as well as incentives for other clean vehicles and clean fuels. It's important to note that there's also incentive for things like biodiesel and renewable natural gas within that. So a lot of things that will help drive advantage.  We have had active conversations in recent years in Europe and growing conversations in the U.S. The Bipartisan Infrastructure bill also put some significant investment in hydrogen infrastructure. And so we believe that this will continue to add to that and are really focused on scaling up our product and production to meet the demand that we think will be there. So it's hard for me to mention specifically to you right now. As I said, we'll continue to talk about what we see as the key milestones in that business, growing revenue and growing our return from the electrolyzer business over time.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. And maybe one quick follow-up, and there have been some discussions about preparing for a potential downturn and how you can flex down amidst that. But one variable that I'm sure you're considering is just the investment cycle for the next step-up in emissions reduction. So how do we think about that factoring into budgeting for next year, some potential increase, investment spending on the combustion side in preparing for tighter emission standards?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So you've seen us increasing our investments, in particular in both New Power and Engine business, as we invest in the technologies and electrolyzers in New Power and also these next-generation fuel-agnostic platforms and engine business. We have the scale advantage globally to do that. Those are investments that we will continue to make. And we're also looking at driving efficiency and improvement in parts of our business that can adjust with the cycle. And so we'll continue to deliver on our financial commitments and strong returns through the ups and downs as we invest in those key areas for our future.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Kauffman: And like everybody else, Tom, thank you for your leadership, and Jennifer, best of luck in the future. I wanted to focus a little bit. You discussed supply chain costs and talked a little bit about what was going on with raw material costs. If we looked at the inflationary part of cost of goods sold, how do those costs stack up against each other, in terms of how much of the increase in expense is more on the raw input side versus how much more are we spending on supply chain than we normally would? And also noting that in recent weeks and months, supply chain costs while still high have been easing, raw material costs while still high have been easing. And I'm just kind of curious, is any of that built into the guide at this point, maintaining the margins where they are?\nMark Smith: Yes. Jeff, this is Mark. So I would say, this year, if you look at our costs, the material costs have been increasing. That's been the biggest single driver on the costs side. Last year, certainly the first half of the year, it was very heavy on the freight -- premium-free costs. But then we started to see more inflation in materials play out over time. So as we talked about, the premium freight costs have come down a little bit, part of that through better coordination and management of the expenses. Material costs continue to increase at this point in time. We put the -- I would say, within a fairly predictable range quarter-to-quarter so far, yes, 1 or 2 commodity costs have come off the peak, but remain at fairly elevated levels. And of course, whatever changes there are in the market, costs of freight and metal markets, those take time to work through the supply chain.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Okay. But Mark, back to the question though. So for the quarter, costs of goods sold was up about 5% on total revenue growth of about 8%. Ex inflationary costs, what are we looking at in terms of that raw material or the costs of goods sold inflation? I'm just trying to understand how much is kind of temporary cost inflation on materials, how much is temporary cost inflation on supply chain costs and kind of what's the underlying rate?\nMark Smith: Let me put it like this. Our material cost in the second quarter increased by 1.9% of sales year-over-year, just to -- what is temporary and what's -- we're always working to make changes to products, redesign things, take costs out. But right now, that's a pretty high level over what -- certainly pre-COVID, pre this inflationary environment, that there's a high level of material cost increases. What's temporary and permanent is very hard to say. But about 1.9%, freight costs are fairly flattish year-over-year, but at a very elevated level. Material cost increase -- there are some pressure on some of the categories, but those are the biggest elements.\nJeffrey Kauffman: All right. That's helpful. And then in terms of the guidance, I'm assuming no real change in either of those in terms of your outlook or has there been a change built into that outlook of margins maintaining?\nMark Smith: No significant change on the costs side. We've lowered our outlook for JV earnings, which is not what you're talking about. But I'm just trying to triangulate back to the overall guidance of lower JV earnings. And we've got slightly stronger aftermarket revenues, particularly in North America, which should balance -- those balance out, but no significant changes on the other categories.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Clulow for closing remarks.\nChristopher Clulow: Great. Thanks, Maria. That concludes our teleconference for the day. Thank you all for participating and your continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Thanks.\nOperator: You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Brilliant. Good morning, everybody. I just -- I had to start by telling you about some rough math I did before I walked in today. And I believe this is my 70th earnings call. It's also going to be my last. I'm very grateful to the analysts and investors who are part of this journey with me. Many of you help me better understand the perspective of our shareholders, which influenced how we ran the company, how we developed our strategies and priorities, and how we communicated about our results and plans for the future. I always try to ensure that the senior leaders in the company understood your views and perspectives, and they understood who they were really working for. Some of you have been at this work almost as long as I have, and your commitment to understanding our company and its potential has been remarkable. I just want you to know that it meant a lot to me.  I'm very proud to have served as the CEO for this company for 10 years, as a senior executive for more than 20 years. It was an honor and a privilege. This company stands for more than its products and technology, its revenue or its earnings, and even its performance for customers all over the world. The people that work here are exceptional humans, not just exceptional workers. That's why this transition was so important to me. It is perhaps the most important work of my entire career. And I have a smile a mile wide today because of the quality of the individual that replaces me and the strength of the team beneath her.  Jennifer Rumsey is a once in a generation leader. She combines the leadership and technical skills needed, with the characters and values required and the inspiration of a CEO that can take this company to places where I could not. I'm as proud as I was on the day I took the job to see her succeed me. Jen? Thank you, Jerry. No question about it. Thanks, Tim. And I have been through a lot of these, and this is an unusual one, there's no question about it. But I'm going to flip it back to Jen just because in terms of conversations with customers about where they are, Jen's actually been doing more of those than I have. But I would say that -- I just kind of repeat the point Mark made. It is an unusual period and it has been an unusual cycle. And I think our team has continued to figure out ways to adapt to it, and I think we will here too. But make no mistake, a lot of us in the industry are trying to figure things out that we haven't faced before, labor shortages, part shortages over extended periods and things like that, I think you've heard from Jen. But let me just turn it back to her for kind of your perspective, Jen, of the customers and what they're looking at. And by the way, I'll miss you, Jamie."

            "name": "Mark Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the second quarter, especially in the context of a challenging global business environment. As Jen mentioned, our second quarter results included a $47 million benefit from adjusting the reserves related to the suspension of our operations in Russia and $29 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business.  To provide clarity on operational performance, I'm going to exclude the impact of these items in my comments. We have provided a breakdown of the costs associated with Russia and the filtration separation costs by line item and by segment in our earnings material to help you understand the underlying performance more clearly.  Now let me go into more details on the second quarter performance. Second quarter revenues of $6.6 billion were up 8% from a year ago. Sales in North America were up 15%, while international revenues declined by 2% due to a sharp slowdown in China. Foreign currency fluctuations, primarily a stronger U.S. dollar, reduced sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1 billion or 15.7% of sales for the quarter compared to $974 million or 15.9% a year ago. The lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by negative other income and lower joint venture earnings in China. Gross margins improved year-over-year and from the first quarter.  Now let me go into more detail by line item. Gross margin of $1.7 billion or 25.6% of sales increased by $208 million or 140 basis points. The benefits of stronger volumes and higher pricing more than offset higher freight and material costs for this quarter. Of course, we have been facing increased costs for an extended period of time. And now our gross margins have returned back to 2019 of pre-COVID levels. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $16 million or 2%, primarily due to higher research costs supporting future growth, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.  Joint venture income declined by $42 million versus a year ago. Lower demand for trucks and construction equipment in China was the primary driver of the decline in earnings. Other income was a negative $18 million, $87 million worse than a year ago. We experienced $48 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our unqualified benefit plans in the second quarter, and this compares to gains of $20 million a year ago. This variation in this one category explains most of the change in other income.  Net earnings for the quarter were $678 million or $4.77 per diluted share compared to $600 million or $4.10 from a year ago. The earnings per share increased due to higher earnings, lower taxes and a reduced share count resulting from share repurchase activity. The all-in effective tax rate in the second quarter was 17.3%, including $36 million or $0.25 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. Operating cash flow in the quarter was an inflow of $599 million compared to $616 million a year ago.  I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2022. For the Engine segment, second quarter revenues increased 11% from a year ago, while EBITDA decreased from 16.1% of sales to 15.2% of sales, as the benefits of stronger volumes and pricing actions in our consolidated earnings were more than offset by lower joint venture income in China. In 2022, we expect the revenues to be up 10%, up 2% from our prior guidance. The increase in sales primarily driven by higher demand for engines and parts in North America. 2022 EBITDA is projected to be approximately 14.5%, in line with our prior guidance.  In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 17% from a year ago to $2.3 billion, a record quarter for the segment. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 11.2% compared to 10.5% sales a year ago, primarily due to stronger parts, whole goods, and sales and pricing actions. We expect 2022 Distribution revenues to be up 11% year-over-year and EBITDA margins in the range of 10.5% of sales, both in line with our prior guidance.  Components segment revenue decreased 2% in the second quarter, primarily driven by weaker demand in China. EBITDA increased from 15.1% of sales to 18.2% of sales, driven by the benefits of pricing actions which offset material cost increases and lower warranty expense. We expect revenues to increase 3% for the year, down from an increase of 6% in our prior guidance, primarily to a lower outlook in China. EBITDA margin is expected to be 16.75% of sales, in line with our prior guidance.  In the Power Systems segment, revenues increased 5% and EBITDA decreased from 12.2% to 10.6% of sales, as the benefit of stronger volumes and pricing were more than offset by higher material and logistics expenses. In 2022, we expect revenues to be up 8% and EBITDA is projected to be approximately 11% for Power Systems, unchanged from our prior year guidance.  In the New Power segment, revenues were $42 million, up 75% from a year ago due to stronger demand for battery electric systems. Our EBITDA loss was $80 million in the quarter, as we continue to invest in the products infrastructure and capabilities to support future growth and was in line with our expectations. In 2022, we still expect revenues for the New Power business to be approximately $200 million, up 72%. And net EBITDA losses are still expected to be in the range of $290 million for New Power, also unchanged from our prior guidance.  As Jen mentioned, we are maintaining our '22 expectations of company revenues to be up 8% and our EBITDA margins of approximately 15.5% of sales. This guidance excludes expenses outside of the normal course of business associated with the separation of the Filtration business, the pending acquisition of Meritor or the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We expect earnings from joint ventures to decline 25% in 2022, excluding the impact of suspension of our business in Russia. And this is down from our prior guide of a decline of 20% due to continued weakness -- or further weakness, in fact, in the China truck market. We are projecting our effective tax rate to be approximately 21.5% for this year, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures were $147 million in the quarter, up from $125 million a year ago. We still expect that our full year capital investments will be in the range of $850 million to $900 million.  We returned $240 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchase of shares in the second quarter, bringing our total cash returns of $758 million for the first half of the year. We still anticipate returning approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. While high inflation and rising global interest rates present risks to global economic growth, we did not experience any significant changes in aggregate demand from our customers over the past quarter. Our focus remains on raising financial performance cycle-over-cycle in our core business, while investing in technologies that will deliver future profitable growth, including in new markets, new applications and with new customers.  We continue to advance our strategy in the second quarter, delivered record quarterly revenues and earnings per share, and recently announced an 8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, the 13th straight year of dividend increases.  Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris. Well, at one point, last year, we were running probably 4x the normal level of premium freight, and that's come down. It has been that we've seen sequential improvement over the last 3 or 4 quarters, but we're still running 2x to 3x kind of extra costs right now. And then you'd asked about decremental margins, Jerry, in the event there's a slowdown. What I would say to you is we have to embrace these cycles when they come. We have a very experienced team that's navigated through several of them. I'm very proud of our record of raising cycle-over-cycle performance at the peak and trough. I can't give you exact decremental margins, but know that we will adjust plan outcome to operate the wells to continue to as and when the next cycle comes. That's all I can say really at this point. I think the biggest challenge in the second half -- well, it's baked into our guidance, is that we see a drop-off in earnings in China. We typically see about a 25% to 30% lower JV income in the second half of the year, and we're projecting that again. You've heard from some of our important customers what their trajectory looks like on the top line going into the third quarter. Yes, there's still a lot of moving parts, still a lot of challenges we're working through. We've maintained our full year guidance. We're slightly behind the EBITDA percent for the full year through the first half of the year, but we're on track, not expecting extraordinary variation, at least from what we know today. I think you just described most of my work plan from Tom, we'll be working on all of those. Thank you. Yes. Q2 was a little stronger than Q1. As Tom and Jen mentioned, there have been some supply chain challenges. So these are little bit, and demand remains strong. And the other thing I'd add is, we're just -- as you'd imagine, we're not just waiting around for changing economic conditions. An important part of how we've grown the earnings over time is just like a continual focus on trying to drive efficiencies in everything that we do. Doesn't always make the headlines, but almost every aspect of our work, we're looking for efficiency, better output. So we're always looking for those types of ways to improve the underlying performance of the business. Yes. Jeff, this is Mark. So I would say, this year, if you look at our costs, the material costs have been increasing. That's been the biggest single driver on the costs side. Last year, certainly the first half of the year, it was very heavy on the freight -- premium-free costs. But then we started to see more inflation in materials play out over time. So as we talked about, the premium freight costs have come down a little bit, part of that through better coordination and management of the expenses. Material costs continue to increase at this point in time. We put the -- I would say, within a fairly predictable range quarter-to-quarter so far, yes, 1 or 2 commodity costs have come off the peak, but remain at fairly elevated levels. And of course, whatever changes there are in the market, costs of freight and metal markets, those take time to work through the supply chain. Let me put it like this. Our material cost in the second quarter increased by 1.9% of sales year-over-year, just to -- what is temporary and what's -- we're always working to make changes to products, redesign things, take costs out. But right now, that's a pretty high level over what -- certainly pre-COVID, pre this inflationary environment, that there's a high level of material cost increases. What's temporary and permanent is very hard to say. But about 1.9%, freight costs are fairly flattish year-over-year, but at a very elevated level. Material cost increase -- there are some pressure on some of the categories, but those are the biggest elements. No significant change on the costs side. We've lowered our outlook for JV earnings, which is not what you're talking about. But I'm just trying to triangulate back to the overall guidance of lower JV earnings. And we've got slightly stronger aftermarket revenues, particularly in North America, which should balance -- those balance out, but no significant changes on the other categories."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom. Good morning. I'm excited to join you this morning in this new capacity as President and CEO for Cummins. In July, we announced that Tom would end his term as CEO effective August 1. It is a bittersweet moment for me as he's been one of the most significant influences in my career and leadership. Tom has been an incredible leader for this company and a true partner and coach to me. Because of his leadership, we are in a strong position to navigate what comes next and execute our Destination Zero strategy. Tom and I share a common vision for Cummins and the role that our company plays empowering a more prosperous world. I feel deeply honored and proud to serve as the new CEO of Cummins, the first woman and just the seventh CEO of this great company. My life and leadership have prepared me for this role at this moment during the critical period for Cummins and our planet. A focus on purpose, people and impact has shaped my career and will influence how I lead. I look forward to working with all of you as we move forward.  I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. And I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2022. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the detail on our performance, I wanted to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the second quarter. The company achieved significant milestones related to 2 previously announced acquisitions: Jacobs Vehicle Systems, or JVS, and Meritor. In April, Cummins completed the acquisition of JVS, adding engine braking, cylinder deactivation, start-stop control and thermal management technologies, which are key components to meeting current and future emissions regulations. On May 26, Meritor's shareholders voted in favor of the Cummins acquisition bid, further validating the potential of what Cummins and Meritor can achieve together. The companies are working together to complete the acquisition this week as we have received all regulatory approvals to close the transaction.  During the second quarter, Cummins announced collaborations with Daimler Truck, North America and Scania to deliver fuel cell electric powertrains for heavy-duty truck applications and with Komatsu on development of zero-emission haulage equipment, including hydrogen fuel cell solutions for large mining haul truck applications. Cummins, Chevron and Walmart also share plans to integrate Cummins X15N natural gas engines, powered by renewable natural gas into Walmart's heavy-duty truck fleet.  These customer collaborations are significant steps in alignment with our Destination Zero strategy to evolve our company, our products and our customers' products to the technologies needed for a decarbonized world. This strategy, which represents a significant growth opportunity for Cummins, includes reducing carbon emissions now by making improvements in engine-based solutions that are broadly available today while rapidly advancing the 0 emissions technologies of the future.  We continue to focus on our people and their development as a strategic advantage for the company. In the second quarter, the company posted its first human capital management report, detailing our commitment to creating and maintaining a dynamic and exciting work environment for our employees.  Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2022 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remained strong across all of our key markets and regions, with the notable exception of China, resulting in record revenues in the second quarter. Revenues for the second quarter of 2022 were $6.6 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the second quarter of 2021. EBITDA was $1.1 billion or 16% compared to $974 million or 15.9% a year ago. Second quarter results included costs of $29 million related to the preparations for the separation of the Filtration business.  As discussed previously, we recorded a charge of $158 million in the first quarter related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. In the second quarter, received certain inventory and other expense amounts reserved previously and incurred some small additional charges, resulting in a net recovery of $47 million. Adjusting for these items, EBITDA was $1 billion or 15.7% of sales. My comments moving forward will exclude the financial impact of the suspension of our Russia operations and the costs associated with the separation of our Filtration business.  EBITDA percentage declined in the second quarter as strength in sales and increased gross margin were offset by a 31% drop in joint venture income from the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the slowdown in China markets. Research and development expenses also increased slightly in the second quarter of 2022 as we continued to invest in products and technologies that will create advantage in the future, particularly in the engine and new power segment. Gross margin percentage improved compared to second quarter of 2021 as the benefit of pricing and higher volumes exceeded the manufacturing, logistics and materials cost increases during the quarter. This pricing only partially offset the impact of elevated supply chain and other inflationary costs that we carried through from 2021 and experienced in the first half of 2022. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 15% to $4 billion, driven by improved pricing, higher volumes and higher aftermarket demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 62,000 units, up 9% from 2021 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 26,000, up 12% from 2021. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 30,000 units in the second quarter of 2022, an increase of 5% from the 2021 levels, while our unit sales were 27,000, up 21% from 2021. We shipped 38,000 engines to [indiscernible] for the use on the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2022, down 9% from 2021 levels due to supply chain issues, which temporarily limited truck production. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 9% as other companies maintained strong capital spending.  Power Systems North America sales were flat compared to 2021 as strength in aftermarket offset lower volumes. Demand remains high in North America markets for Power Systems, but revenues for North America power generation declined by 3% as supply chain constraints limited our production for both U.S. military and mobile power applications. Our international revenues decreased by 2% in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a year ago. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.2 billion, a decrease of 43% due to lower sales in the on-highway and construction markets. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 173,000 units, a decrease of 70% from 2021. Last year's numbers were strong, supported by a prebuy ahead of NS VI. But weaker new vehicle demand and economic impacts from shutdowns as the country is responding to a COVID-19 resurgence have pushed the market to the lowest level since 2007.  Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 25,000, a decrease of 70% despite the very difficult environment in China. We did see growth in some of our power systems markets, particularly mining and oil and gas. The light-duty market in China decreased 38% from 2021 levels to 380,000 units. While our units sold, including joint ventures, were 23,000, a decrease of 40%. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 66,000 units, a decrease of 32% from 2021 levels. The decrease was driven by declining demand within the property market and the COVID-19 impact on infrastructure demand. Our units sold were 9,900 units, a decrease of 41%. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 5% in the second quarter due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 resurgence.  Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were a record $594 million, an increase of 51% from the second quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 131%, while our shipments increased 78%, lagging the industry production due to lower growth in the heavy commercial vehicle segment. The high level of growth in the second quarter is coming off a very low base when India was experiencing a COVID-19 peak in 2021. Demand for power generation and construction equipment increased in the second quarter as economic activity continued to improve. In Brazil, our revenue increased 7%, driven by improved demand in most end markets.  Now let me provide our outlook for 2022, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full year 2022 revenue guidance of up 8% versus last year. This guidance reflects stronger performance in North America and a weaker market outlook in China as well as the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. We are forecasting higher demand in global oil and gas and power generation markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2021. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 250,000 units to 260,000 units in 2022, a 10% to 15% increase over a year ago. The supply chain constraints our industry is experiencing continue to limit our collective ability to fully meet strong end customer demand. In North America medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 120,000 to 130,000 units, a 5% to 10% increase from 2021. We are now projecting our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America to be flat compared to 2021, an update to our previous guidance down 5%. In China, we are now projecting total revenue, including joint ventures, to decrease 20% to 25% in 2022, an update to our previous guidance of down 10%. We now project a 50% reduction in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 15% reduction in demand for the light-duty truck market compared to a 40% decline and a 12% reduction, respectively, in our previous guidance. Industry sales of excavators in China are expected to decline 30% from record levels in 2021, consistent with our prior guidance.  Despite the difficult economic and market environment in China, we have significantly improved our presence and profitability in the region compared to private -- prior cycles and are well positioned for continued outgrowth across our end markets in the region. As an illustration from 2019 to 2022, the demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks is projected to be down 40%, while across the same period, we are forecasting an increase in earnings from joint ventures in China.  As we look ahead, industry volume of NF VI product will increase through 2022 as the new regulations are implemented more broadly. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to continue to outgrow the market and support our partners through this transition. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions as our market share increases and the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to increase 15% in 2022, an improvement from our previous guidance of up 10%. We expect industry demand for trucks to increase approximately 30% in 2022.  We continue to project most major global high horsepower markets will improve in 2022. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat in 2022 compared to the prior year, consistent with previous guidance. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 120%, an update from our previous guidance of up 95%. Strong demand in the U.S. and other oil and gas markets have fueled this improved outlook.  Revenue in global power generation markets are expected to increase 5%, driven by increases in nonresidential construction, consistent with our prior guidance. We are now projecting aftermarket sales to increase 15% to 20% from 2021, an improvement from our previous estimate of up 15%. This is driven by parts demand within our North America On-Highway business as well as global Power Systems markets.  In New Power, we continue to expect full year sales to be approximately $200 million. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzers, which we expect to convert to backlog and be delivered over the course of the next 12 to 18 months. Additionally, we will continue to accelerate our collaboration with OEMs on both electrified power and fuel cells for applications in 2022 as highlighted by the announcements I noted previously.  We are maintaining our full year 2022 EBITDA guidance of approximately 15.5%, excluding the impacts of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia, the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our filtration business and the expected costs associated with the pending acquisition of Meritor. We expect to deliver the strong profitability despite the supply chain constraints and rising inflationary costs that we are experiencing. During the quarter, we returned $240 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders for the year. Strong execution resulted in record sales in the quarter despite very difficult operating environment. The ongoing supply chain constraints and rising costs throughout the industry, continued COVID-19-related impacts and the effect of the conflict in Ukraine all present challenges to operating our business.  I am grateful for the commitment of our employees across the organization who have worked tirelessly to overcome these challenges. Their efforts resulted in a strong quarter, enabling us to support our customers while generating solid returns.  Cummins is in an excellent position to continue to execute our Destination Zero strategy, invest in the products and technologies that will fund future growth and drive advantage for our customers. We will accomplish this while generating strong financial results and meeting our commitment to return cash to shareholders. It's an exciting time to become CEO.  Thank you for joining us today. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Thanks, Jerry. Great. Thanks, Jerry. Yes, we continue to experience an environment where supply chain is limiting our production in most of our markets. And as you've seen, the team here has worked really hard to navigate that and continue to deliver as much product as we can to our customers who are also experiencing issues.  Some of those issues have lessened. We continue however to experience constraints, in particular, in the electronics space, microprocessors and other electronic components. We've seen improvement in our premium freight and also are closely monitoring what's going on with the standard freight rates. So while we have some improvement off the peak, we're still running at high levels as we continue to navigate disruptions caused by a combination of supply constraints and COVID-related disruptions. Yes. Great, great. Thanks, Tom. As Mark and Tom have said, we're in a cyclical business. We have a strong team that understands how to navigate and manage over the cycles and use the cycles to strengthen the business and emerge stronger. And this is not a typical cycle because, coming out of the COVID-19 -- early part of COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen really strong demand that has been constrained by supply chain constraints across the industry. And we have been unable to meet our collective customer demand in these markets outside of China. That have been strong now for 18 months. You see that showing up in very high aftermarket demand as well as customers have been using these products heavily and had higher parts demand as they worked to keep them running.  So despite the fact that we do see some decrease in spot rates, some reduction off of really high indicators, when I talk to customers and look at some of these backlogs and freight activity, it's still very strong. And they still would like us to supply more than we're able to. So the conversations are all focused on where are we at with supply constraints and can we ship more to them. We continue to monitor those overall indicators. At this point, end customer demand is strong. Aftermarket demand is strong. Used truck prices continue to be elevated. And also recall, with higher fuel prices, these more fuel-efficient, next-generation products are attractive to customers. And so we'll continue to stay close to it and monitor what happens. But right now, we see supply being the constraint through this year outside of China. Thank you, Jamie. Appreciate the question. And as you noted, Tom and I have developed the Destination Zero strategy together. I've been a member of the Cummins leadership team now for more than 7 years as Chief Technical Officer, leading the Components business, Chief Operating Officer, and now CEO. So the strategy, the focus of the company going forward remains the same. The commitment to all of our stakeholders to deliver strong results, to really create strategic advantage to our people will continue.  I think the big difference is just that, as we continue to operate in this evolving environment, paying attention to how markets are evolving, technologies are evolving, integration of Meritor, major new company, I'm going to be thinking a lot about strategic execution, and what does that mean for different parts of our business as our strategy evolves and paying attention to a more dynamic environment. And that's one of the reasons why I've kept the President role in addition to CEO is to stay close to the businesses as we focus not only on continuing to refine that strategy, but really driving strategic execution and delivering results.  As it relates to next year, we'll, of course, talk later more about next year. You've heard us say we see supply being the limiting factor through this year. Backlog is strong. China is down, and will improve, right? There's a lot of opportunity to improve. And Cummins is very well positioned. Our products are performing very well. The customer demand for that product is strong. We have new partnership opportunities in the core business and in New Power. And we'll continue to invest in products that will position the company for the future and manage through the cycles as they come. Yes. Good question. So obviously, we've moved forward with our JBS acquisition and Meritor will complete this week. We're continuing to make these key investments in the future. And we are still in the process on the separation of our Filtration business as we've disclosed previously and monitoring the environment as that continues. Yes, yes. Great question. So we did -- we delivered the highest revenue in the second quarter to date from our New Power business at $42 million and made a lot of progress across all parts of the business. So you saw announcements of new partnerships on fuel cells, both on and off-highway, where we think long term the market will move. Continuing to make progress and having lots of conversations on the electrolyzers and demonstrating the capability of our PEM electrolyzer solutions there. And we believe, as we demonstrate some of those larger installations of PEM electrolyzer, that the market's going to increasingly move towards that solution and that we're well positioned competitively.  The market is lumpy at this point. And a lot of our focus is on building up capacity and scale to meet the demand. And so we will -- Amy and I will continue to be talking about what are those key milestones that we see in the market and in our scale-up activity and how that's evolving. We still feel very optimistic. And with this energy challenge that we see in the global world, expect that the focus and interest in green hydrogen will continue to grow.  And lastly, with the Meritor acquisition, that's another key component that we think positions us well in the electric powertrain. And we'll be building on the business that we have and very complementary to our existing New Power business and electrified powertrain. So overall, well positioned for the future with New Power. Yes. Great. So we're hopeful that the Inflation Reduction Act will get passed. It has many key provisions that we think are important for advancing lower carbon solutions, and it fits well with our Destination Zero strategy. It's really critical that there's investment to build out infrastructure and to make these technologies more affordable as they scale in advance. So we are -- have been active and advocating for some of the key energy provisions in that act, and we'll continue to do that as our Congress considers it. Yes. What happens with China COVID lockdowns is one of the big questions that we debate a lot. At this point, they continue to have this dynamic lockdown strategy. And we've continued to see some smaller scale lockdowns that have been happening and operating and kind of closed loop, closed circle environments within that from a business perspective. So I don't see when and how they completely evolve out of that. We're prepared to continue to operate in that type of environment. However, we do think that, that market is going to come back. It's a large market. It's an important market for us to be a part of because of its size. And we are committed to continuing to invest in the products and joint ventures that we have there, while also ensuring from a global supply chain perspective that we have resiliency in our supply chain so that we can navigate through COVID, weather disruptions and other constraints. Yes. No. It's a great question. And within that, Inflation Reduction Act, as you noted, there is incentive for hydrogen production, which is significant, as well as incentives for other clean vehicles and clean fuels. It's important to note that there's also incentive for things like biodiesel and renewable natural gas within that. So a lot of things that will help drive advantage.  We have had active conversations in recent years in Europe and growing conversations in the U.S. The Bipartisan Infrastructure bill also put some significant investment in hydrogen infrastructure. And so we believe that this will continue to add to that and are really focused on scaling up our product and production to meet the demand that we think will be there. So it's hard for me to mention specifically to you right now. As I said, we'll continue to talk about what we see as the key milestones in that business, growing revenue and growing our return from the electrolyzer business over time. Yes. So you've seen us increasing our investments, in particular in both New Power and Engine business, as we invest in the technologies and electrolyzers in New Power and also these next-generation fuel-agnostic platforms and engine business. We have the scale advantage globally to do that. Those are investments that we will continue to make. And we're also looking at driving efficiency and improvement in parts of our business that can adjust with the cycle. And so we'll continue to deliver on our financial commitments and strong returns through the ups and downs as we invest in those key areas for our future."

Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Villavarayan: Good morning. Carl and I look forward to walking you through an excellent first quarter. Before I begin, I want to thank the exceptional Meritor team for their hard work and dedication to our customers. Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 3. Overall, we are pleased with our financial performance and are off to a good start for the year. We demonstrated our ability to manage the business well through a challenging set of factors on higher sales driven by stronger demand in most of our end global markets. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 11.5% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.80, an increase of more than 35% year-over-year. We\u2019re working closely with our customers and suppliers to offset historically high freight and material costs while managing supply chain constraint and a prolonged labor shortage. We\u2019re navigating these headwinds and are confident in our full year outlook that we\u2019re reaffirming today.  In December, we introduced aggressive M2025 targets that include growing $500 million in revenue above market, with one half coming from electrification and expanding margins to 13% while generating $600 million in free cash flow. M2025 represents Meritor fourth M plan, our execution of these plans have transformed the company since the introduction of M2016, we have increased adjusted earnings per share by more than $2 through fiscal 2021 and expect to further increase EPS by almost an additional dollar this fiscal year. We have also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 350 basis points. We had a very successful first quarter in terms of finalizing New Business Awards, some of which we announced at Investor Day. Let me briefly recap the significance of these. We have an exclusive agreement with Thomas Built Bus for Meritor\u2019s electric powertrain with SOP plan for 2024. With the electric school bus market expected to be one of the fastest adopting segments in large part due to the infrastructure bill, this agreement represents a meaningful near term opportunity to accelerate our electrification journey and expand our long term relationship with Daimler Trucks, North America. We extended our multiyear agreement with PACCAR to supply electric powertrain and full electric solutions for Kenworth and Peterbilt tractors and Refuse trucks. And we added three new prototype collaborations in the quarter with two different customers, two hydrogen fuel cell applications for Hexagon and a road sweeper platform for Electra. This makes the fifth quarter in a row that we have announced new electrification wins. In our core business, we\u2019re excited to significantly increase our on-highway presence in China. With this five year agreement, we will supply Daimler with rear axles for the Actros. We also have a new business win with one of our largest trailer customers. This is our first five year agreement with Wabash and is valued at more than $150 million. You can see on slide 4 that Meritor is differentiating itself in the industry. We believe our growing number of electrification awards is the true measure of the value our customers place on our integration capabilities and electric powertrain. In fact, our electrification revenue forecast for fiscal 2022 has increased by more than 30% since December. Slide 5 brings into focus all our electrification programs announced to-date. I want to make three important points with this slide. First, half of our production programs are in the medium-duty with accelerated adoption rate expected in this segment, we anticipate that volumes on these programs will grow faster than on the heavy side, which is all growth for us. Second, we\u2019re either exclusive or standard position on all these programs. And finally, we have eight production contracts, three with large OEMs and the remainder with promising startups. We look forward to helping more customers drive to a cleaner world.  On slide 6, I want to emphasize the importance of the work we\u2019re doing at our innovation complex in Escondido, California. With the technical expertise inherent in this operation we can offer a complete turnkey vehicle electric vehicle solution. In addition to the electric powertrain, Meritor can provide the PCAS or power controls and accessory subsystem. Our acquisition of TransPower gave us a wealth of experience in vehicle controls that we have strengthened since taking ownership in 2020. We\u2019re proud to be production ready for our electric powertrain and the full electric system. We\u2019re confident in our capabilities and in the important role Meritor will play as commercial vehicles transform over the next decade. This is an incredibly exciting time for us. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Carl. \nCarl Anderson: Thanks, Chris and good morning. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll review our first quarter financial results and outlook for fiscal year 2022. Overall, we delivered excellent financial performance to begin the final year of our M2022 plan. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.80. Now let\u2019s review the details of our financial results on slide 7. Overall, revenue came in at $984 million, up 11% from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher truck production in most markets as orders remain elevated around the globe. Net income from continuing operations was $54 million compared to $32 million last year. Higher net income was driven by increased sales volumes and lower interest expense, partially offset by net fuel costs. We also benefited from a $6 million settlement with an insurance carrier related to our asbestos liability this quarter. On a comparative basis, you will recall last year we recognize a $6 million onetime gain from our joint venture in Brazil, relating to a value added tax credit. Adjusted EBITDA was $113 million, an increase of $11 million from last year. The growth in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by higher sales volumes partially offset by net steel costs. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.80, up $0.21 from last year. And finally, free cash flow for the quarter was the use of $39 million compared to $34 million of cash generated last year. The decrease was in line with our expectations as we built higher inventory levels to support an anticipated strong production environment throughout the year. Additionally, incentive compensation payments were higher this year. Now I will discuss our segment results for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck were $785 million, up nearly 14% year-over-year. The increase was driven by higher truck production in most global market. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $69 million, up $6 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.8% a slight decrease of 30 basis points from a year ago. Higher sales partially offset by net fuel costs drove an increase to adjusted EBITDA. However, adjusted EBITDA margin was lower as net sale costs impacted sales conversion. Aftermarket industrial sales were $241 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, an increase of $7 million compared to the prior year. Pricing actions executed over the last year in the segment was the primary driver of the improvement in revenue. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $3 million to $38 million, and EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points to 15.8%. The expansion in segment adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily from the footprint optimization initiatives implemented after the first quarter last year.  Now let\u2019s review our global production outlook on slide 8. As we saw last quarter demand remained strong across our markets. In the North American Class 8 market the backlog is estimated at approximately 260,000 trucks representing nearly a full year of industry production. While we are closely monitoring constraints in the global supply chain, we are beginning to see some signs of stabilization. We are expecting supply chains to continue to improve as we progress throughout the year. As a result, we are not seeing a significant change from our November view. Therefore, we are maintaining our global production forecast for all markets.  Let\u2019s turn to slide 9 for an update to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. Based on first quarter results and our expectations for the rest of the year we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2022 guidance across all of our metrics. We expect revenue to be in a range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion based on our unchanged global market assumptions. Additionally, our expectations for adjusted EBITDA margin remains between 11.5% to 12.5%. We continue to plan for pricing actions to help mitigate steel, freight and labor cost pressures. We expect these recoveries to be more fully realized as we progress through the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations remain in a range of $3.25 to $3.75. And finally, our free cash flow guidance is also unchanged with a projected range of $175 million to $200 million. Our first quarter results provide a great foundation for a successful final year of M2022. We remain focused on executing this plan while simultaneously gearing up for M2025. As we approach the start of this new plan, we are forging a path with the coming electrification of the commercial vehicle industry. The road ahead is blue. Now we will take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sherif El-Sabbahy from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nSherif El-Sabbahy: So first off, congratulations, a great quarter. On the commercial truck margins, the first quarter saw some headwinds from steel. Looking at similar incremental data suggests deals around the $10 million to $11 million headwind to EBITDA. Is that correct? And then how would you see the cadence of those headwinds playing out quarter to quarter throughout the year? \nCarlAnderson: Yes, thanks Sherif. Yes, for the entire quarter steel was actually about a $24 million net headwind for us with the vast majority of that close to $20 million really affecting the commercial truck segment. And as we look forward, we think steel will continue to be a headwind for the rest of this year. But the next big step of that probably will be in the second quarter. And then as we look forward for the second half, we do believe, based off the trend line we\u2019re seeing in steel prices that we\u2019ll start seeing that the impact really starts to decline as we get in the second half.\nSherif El-Sabbahy: Makes sense. And then last quarter, you mentioned it was a very difficult quarter with the sporadic shutdowns from semis and limited visibility. And you expected that to normalize in the first quarter. So have you seen sort of a normalization of those lingering shortages and do you have better visibility based on OEM setting their line rates?\nCarl Anderson: Yes, Sharif, I\u2019ll take that one. For sure, I mean, based on I think where we\u2019re seeing demand, the supply chain has improved from Q4 to Q1, but to your point that\u2019s not resolved. And I would say, certainly, as we see from Q1 to Q2 we do see more stabilization. And it\u2019s probably too early to declare a victory. And you do see over time this continuing to improve. But at this point, we certainly do see an improvement, both from a supply chain standpoint, and let\u2019s call it more from our customers. Customers getting far more comfortable with their ability to get chips or understand their chip supply and also forecast better. As you can also see with PACCAR\u2019s announcement, and taking the number of offline trucks, they\u2019re obviously starting to get more chips in the system. So we do see that improving but again, probably too early to declare victory.\nSherif El-Sabbahy: And just one final one, with the PACCAR partnership expansion you announced last evening. How long is that multi, I know, it\u2019s a multiyear. Are you disclosing how long that relationship lasts? And then, with regards to the integration and software aspect of that relationship how sticky do you see that being longer term as EV adoption expands and the partnership evolves?\nChris Villavarayan: Well, Sherif. Thanks. That\u2019s a great question that I\u2019d love to talk to. So in terms of the relationship that we announced, it\u2019s through 2025. But just to put it in perspective across the two platforms on the day cab, and the waste trucks where we\u2019re releasing six platforms and to just put it in perspective, that\u2019s about somewhere between 1,500 to 1800 components across the power electronics. So the PCAS, the battery management system, as well as the ePowertrain, so in total between the two teams, we brought 10,000 parts to production in a period of 18 months to 24 months, and it\u2019s PACCAR saw how complex that process was and obviously was an integral part of working with that. And that integration ties software between obviously the PCAS, the battery system, the powertrain, but also their truck, and all the validation that\u2019s gone through that, and we put this into production in December. So certainly, they\u2019ve seen the value that we\u2019ve brought to the marketplace with them, and provided as an extension, and it\u2019s truly a validation of the value of the Meritor proposition. So we\u2019re very proud of it.\nSherif El-Sabbahy: Thanks, I\u2019ll pass it along.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from a line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Spak: Thanks. I guess my first question is, is really sort of bigger picture here. If we go back to your capital markets say, if I made a point of talking about additional system design on electrification including more software features, and I think you\u2019re getting highlighted that today on the full design system, on the full system design side. I guess what I\u2019m curious about is how much you\u2019re going to need to spend to hire the right people and how, and your ability to attract those individuals because clearly there is, I think there\u2019s a limited set of people with the skill set, and you\u2019re competing against, in some cases, your customers in some cases other end markets like electrification, etc, and in some cases, just for even other industries. So maybe you could just talk a little bit about that and sort of how you see the cost related to that over the coming years and also your ability to get the right people you need to, to execute on that plan?\nChris Villavarayan: Well, I think probably a good perspective to start on this Joe, is, is probably off our slide 5, and if look at the fact that we have eight production contracts, half of them coming from the medium duty space and half of them coming from the heavy space. It probably is a good starting point that the customer certainly believe that we have the right building blocks in place. So then going to that slide that the following slide on slide 6 that walks through what did we do across both those spaces. So let me take a minute and walk you through on the full system. So on the full system, as we did in the capital market space we talked a meeting, we talked across the three segments that were approaching this. So when we think about heavy, which is core to Meritor, we invested in TransPower. We acquired it and we used it as the building blocks to not only give us the access to test our product, but also work with customers such as PACCAR to drive that system and bring it to production. And for us to have been able to done that, to do that the number of folks that we have already put in place in Escondido as well as in Detroit seems to have certainly supported that. And it\u2019s certainly working for us. So on that side, I believe that we have the right building block to go approach that. On the transit space and the medium duty space, if you notice, we made announcements with BAE to help us on the transit space. And we made announcements with C-Electric to help us with the full system as we focused more on the powertrain. So that\u2019s how we focused on how we want to approach the full system capability as well as working with our customers some of which obviously have that system. And on the e-powertrain, we certainly believe again, that we have the right building blocks more because of the wins across all of them. We\u2019ve announced 14 wins on this side on our motors and inverters. We work with Danfoss, which we believe is a strong partner who obviously has scales on motors. And then we are putting inverter capability internally as well as working with external parties. And again, as this evolves, we will continue to look at M&A. But at this point, based on the validation that we\u2019re getting from the customers, we believe we have the right building blocks. \nJoseph Spak: But I guess just maybe in building those building blocks or in retaining some of those sort of the talent for those building blocks like, is that proving to be costly? Or how do you think about that sort of on a go forward basis, because they get especially starting to try to get more into some of the software it seems like that there could be sort of an incremental cost to your business. And I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s not a return on that. But like, it seems like the cost has to come before the return?\nChris Villavarayan: And maybe I\u2019ll split that up into parts. Joe. I\u2019ll answer the question on in terms of finding the talent and retaining the talent, and maybe Carl can pick up what\u2019s the cost of it, but in terms of certainly finding the talent and returning the talent part of it is being in Detroit, we certainly have been successful in finding that talent. Our approach with how we acquire TransPower certainly gave us a baseline of folks. And so we were able to build off that. So to this point, we don\u2019t seem to have struggled with finding people. In fact, we continue to add and grow in this area. And talking to my CTO, he certainly doesn\u2019t seem to be having struggles just this yet, but in terms of costs.\nCarl Anderson: Yes, Joe as mentioned in the strategy day if I look forward from an R&D perspective, we are looking at increasing that quite substantially probably close to 30%, from what our current run rate has been. But I think the other planning assumption and how we\u2019re running the companies, we are looking at pivoting some of our expense and costs we are that we support the traditional business into what we\u2019re doing on electrification. So I think it\u2019s all embedded in our planning assumptions as we look to drive the M2025. So that you\u2019re absolutely right, you\u2019ll see that cost increase as relates to all the efforts we\u2019re doing there, but we\u2019re also doing a lot where we\u2019ll be reducing some of the costs on our traditional products as well.\nJoseph Spak: Thanks Carl and then just more near term, I guess. Can you sort of update us on steel costs and recoveries for the balance of the year? We\u2019ve obviously seen at least spots deals sort of come off the highs here. But I know there can be sort of lags in both directions in terms of sort of outflows for your business. So how are you sort of thinking about steel cost and recoveries for the balance of the year? I know, you didn\u2019t sort of change your guidance, but it seems like probably spot still has sort of maybe moved versus prior.\nCarl Anderson: It has. So I think from a forecast perspective we were planning originally to have steel decline throughout the year when we last spoke in November. I would say that where I see spot prices today, they are coming in a little bit lower than what we originally were planning for. But from a lag perspective, obviously, steel is still a significant headwind for us this quarter as I referenced earlier. We expect that also to happen in the second quarter, and then you\u2019ll start seeing that kind of normalize, as we kind of get into the second half of our fiscal year.\nJoseph Spak: To be like more neutral in the back half or kind of like a year-over-year positive by the back half?\nCarl Anderson: It could be, it could turn into a year-over-year positive depending on where the spot prices kind of come to, and it does get. There\u2019s that lag effect, as you referenced before, depending on most of our contracts somewhere it\u2019s three to six months. So it depends. But yes, that would be our expectation at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Chan from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBruce Chan: Good morning and congrats on the results. Don\u2019t really want to feel wet blanket here, but wondering if you can maybe just give us some brief commentary on order cancellations. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not really in the picture today. But maybe you can just remind us of what kinds of deposits or contract penalties if any there are for cancellation. And how do you couch the risk of cancellations to earnings and margins when you think about the sensitivities that you\u2019ve built into that M2025 plan?\nChris Villavarayan: So I think obviously maybe you\u2019re referring back to about November or December when it\u2019s, we saw a little bit of a spike, let\u2019s call it to 6% on cancellations on Class 8. But honestly when I look at it, Bruce, the demand is incredibly strong out there. I mean we got 260,000 trucks in the backlog, which is almost a year and we sit here and we look at this current market, and you wonder about the challenges, but if I go back to 2018, which was preparing for the second highest market we\u2019ve ever seen in 2019 you still had regions that were going the wrong way. So we had India going the wrong way. We saw South America kind of still coming out of the recession. But at this point, when you look at 2021, you got India bouncing back from their weakest. If I go back to South America, they\u2019re running at 150,000 trucks up from 109 in 2018/2019 timeframe. In North America if you look at between ACT and FDR, were somewhere between the 285 to 290 the midpoint being 290, our forecast is 280. And you got yet another almost 12 months in backlog. So we see enormous demand and I would say there\u2019s the silver lining is once we figured out how to resolve some of the supply chain constraints I do see more of a demand story. I think some of the elements of the cancellations was frankly OEs refloating going forward, as well as fleets just adjusting their order board, because they just can\u2019t get anything in the next three to six months.\nBruce Chan: Now that\u2019s very helpful. And obviously, the portfolio as we get later into the plan is looking a little bit different. It\u2019s a little bit more diversified. So maybe towards that end and I\u2019m not sure if I missed this early in your commentary. But maybe you can give some commentary on the EV revenue backlog. I think that\u2019s something that you also mentioned during the Capital Markets Day. Is that trending any differently as we sit here in February? I know, it\u2019s only been a few months. \nChris Villavarayan: Well, I\u2019ll start off, I think we had talked about $500 million or a $0.5 billion in backlog, right through to let\u2019s call it the capital markets day. I would say that, obviously, from what we see in forecasts that it\u2019s now we\u2019re significantly heading north of that. But what we did was we switched from talking about backlogs to now driving defined revenue within the years so that just to give a better perspective of how Meritor approaches things. And so that\u2019s the one where in my prepared remarks, I talked about revenue that we\u2019ve planned for 22 actually being up 30%. And our target for 2025 is $280 million, which we\u2019re as we see where the backlog is sitting, we\u2019re pretty confident we\u2019re certainly seeing a path to hit that plus some as you know, we approach this pretty conservatively as Meritor.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBrian Johnson: Yes, thank you. I want to talk a little bit more about the electrification going blue angle. The first question is, can you give us any sense of the win rates on the 14Xe Axel? Second would be where different OEMs are in sourcing, obviously, the German truck companies and Daimler in particular, tend to do more both engine and axle work in house. That\u2019s question number two? And then question number three is a pushback we get from investors is, yes, you\u2019re making progress, but what about Cummins, Eaton and Allison. They are well entrenched with the same OEMs that you serve. Are they going to wake up one day and flex their muscle in this segment and does that worry you is Meritor management?\nChris Villavarayan: So good morning, Brian, love to take that question. So I\u2019m going to break it into three sections. I think the first part really, in terms of the 14Xe and the success rate on the 14Xe. So again, going back to that slide 5, all of that is with the 14Xe with the exception of the MAN announced, the Volkswagen announcement that we have, that\u2019s working off what we call an echo axle that\u2019s designed to work with a remote mounted system, what with the future, being on a medium duty 12Xe. But everything that we have announced on that page is or let\u2019s call it the 14 that we\u2019re working on are all working off the 14Xe and then we\u2019re super proud of that, because it really shows that I think whether folks are building ground up which are let\u2019s call it the new entrants, such as Lion or Volta that have an option of designing whatever technology they want, or the folks that are, let\u2019s call it the, the traditional OEMs, whether it\u2019s Daimler or whether it\u2019s PACCAR or whether it\u2019s Autocar they\u2019ve picked the 14Xe. So that\u2019s, I think, the first comment. The second question in terms of vertical integration, I believe that there\u2019s so much opportunity here and that there\u2019s naturally going to be more competition. We\u2019re going to see more suppliers, more OEMs entering this space. But frankly, we face that today. I mean, if you think about Daimler in North America, they still buy 50% of their class 8 axles from us, even though they\u2019re vertically integrated. But I see the opportunity for us to grow in this space, primarily because of three reasons. The first one is, if you notice, half the wins are in the medium duty space. We only have 15% share there. So this is pure growth from that segments as we every entry that we make there. The content is three to four times more content. So with that, I mean, if you think about our axle\u2019s volume, and if you think about this transitioning, we\u2019re getting so much more in revenue and content as we transition here. And finally, in concept of vertical integration, I think the OEs whether it\u2019s Daimler, as you defined it, let\u2019s call it the European OEs they certainly see value here and with the announcement that we made, both at the strategy day or today, with Daimler they\u2019re working with us on the Thomasville school bus, which is an exclusive agreement. And it\u2019s something that they certainly have the capability on their own and they certainly picked us. So we\u2019re pretty confident that customers over time will see value. And in any case, across those three reasons, we see a path to continue to grow.\nBrian Johnson: And any indication that the other, we know data strategy pretty well, but the other powertrain players in the North American truck space, whether you even see them in these RFP situations?\nChris Villavarayan: We do. As I mentioned, I think there are there are more competitors, but frankly, I think I look at it from what\u2019s our strengths that we bring to the marketplace. And it is really the fact that just put it in perspective Brian, we have around the world, we\u2019re the number one commercial axle provider in North America. If you think about the fact that we have a scale of 70%, 7 out of 10 that run on our product, which if you put it in perspective is 2,000, about 1,500 to 2,000 axles. So the e-power trains built off that scale. And it\u2019s frankly, we\u2019ve been designing efficiency into axles for over a century. So we believe we have that capability will help us. Now in terms of some of the other competitors you mentioned, I believe that technology is moving into our space. So whether it\u2019s the engine or their transmission that technology is moving into the axle and who better understands that for the last 100 years, but us. So I think that\u2019s why we believe we have the strength here. And we certainly see that validated with in terms of the customers. The customers are being methodical. They are testing which we obviously expect them to do. They\u2019re testing many products. Obviously there is value in some of the things that our competitors are doing. But we believe the market is so big and there\u2019s enormous opportunity here that the basket is great for all of us.\nBrian Johnson: Thank you and look forward to discussing this further in Florida in a couple of weeks.\nChris Villavarayan: Absolutely, look forward to it too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Well, hi, good morning. This is [Indiscernible] on for Ryan. I just had one question on incremental margins. You talked about being able to offset some of the commodities and trade pressures through price. Just curious, in terms of new wage inflation, it was managed pretty well in the first quarter. But on a go forward basis given where we are with wage inflation, did you see any change in view to your incremental margins on a go forward basis? How do you manage that or flex that in the future? That\u2019s the only question. Thanks.\nChris Villavarayan: Yes, we are definitely seeing wage inflation. Primarily, it\u2019s a U.S. story for us. It\u2019s obviously something that\u2019s embedded in our current forecast. And so obviously we\u2019re finding other ways to offset that as well as we think about what it means for the rest of the year. So, no change in margin, obviously, we kept everything unchanged from our guide that we had back in November. So I think it\u2019s part of its internal continuing to drive internal efficiency, as well as discussions that we\u2019re having with our customers as it relates to pricing.\nUnidentified Analyst: So like going forward and beyond the current year if inflation does persist, do you feel like you can continue to manage that through other areas of maybe cost reductions or your pricing?\nChris Villavarayan: Yes. That is the plan. I think in addition to kind of our normal approach and strategy I think you\u2019re going to see us obviously, look to automate even further, and many in most of our facilities as well as to provide other offsets for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks for the color and good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time I\u2019m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Todd Chirillo for closing remarks.\nTodd Chirillo: Thank you for joining our call today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good morning. Carl and I look forward to walking you through an excellent first quarter. Before I begin, I want to thank the exceptional Meritor team for their hard work and dedication to our customers. Now, let's turn to slide 3. Overall, we are pleased with our financial performance and are off to a good start for the year. We demonstrated our ability to manage the business well through a challenging set of factors on higher sales driven by stronger demand in most of our end global markets. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter was 11.5% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.80, an increase of more than 35% year-over-year. We're working closely with our customers and suppliers to offset historically high freight and material costs while managing supply chain constraint and a prolonged labor shortage. We're navigating these headwinds and are confident in our full year outlook that we're reaffirming today.  In December, we introduced aggressive M2025 targets that include growing $500 million in revenue above market, with one half coming from electrification and expanding margins to 13% while generating $600 million in free cash flow. M2025 represents Meritor fourth M plan, our execution of these plans have transformed the company since the introduction of M2016, we have increased adjusted earnings per share by more than $2 through fiscal 2021 and expect to further increase EPS by almost an additional dollar this fiscal year. We have also expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 350 basis points. We had a very successful first quarter in terms of finalizing New Business Awards, some of which we announced at Investor Day. Let me briefly recap the significance of these. We have an exclusive agreement with Thomas Built Bus for Meritor's electric powertrain with SOP plan for 2024. With the electric school bus market expected to be one of the fastest adopting segments in large part due to the infrastructure bill, this agreement represents a meaningful near term opportunity to accelerate our electrification journey and expand our long term relationship with Daimler Trucks, North America. We extended our multiyear agreement with PACCAR to supply electric powertrain and full electric solutions for Kenworth and Peterbilt tractors and Refuse trucks. And we added three new prototype collaborations in the quarter with two different customers, two hydrogen fuel cell applications for Hexagon and a road sweeper platform for Electra. This makes the fifth quarter in a row that we have announced new electrification wins. In our core business, we're excited to significantly increase our on-highway presence in China. With this five year agreement, we will supply Daimler with rear axles for the Actros. We also have a new business win with one of our largest trailer customers. This is our first five year agreement with Wabash and is valued at more than $150 million. You can see on slide 4 that Meritor is differentiating itself in the industry. We believe our growing number of electrification awards is the true measure of the value our customers place on our integration capabilities and electric powertrain. In fact, our electrification revenue forecast for fiscal 2022 has increased by more than 30% since December. Slide 5 brings into focus all our electrification programs announced to-date. I want to make three important points with this slide. First, half of our production programs are in the medium-duty with accelerated adoption rate expected in this segment, we anticipate that volumes on these programs will grow faster than on the heavy side, which is all growth for us. Second, we're either exclusive or standard position on all these programs. And finally, we have eight production contracts, three with large OEMs and the remainder with promising startups. We look forward to helping more customers drive to a cleaner world.  On slide 6, I want to emphasize the importance of the work we're doing at our innovation complex in Escondido, California. With the technical expertise inherent in this operation we can offer a complete turnkey vehicle electric vehicle solution. In addition to the electric powertrain, Meritor can provide the PCAS or power controls and accessory subsystem. Our acquisition of TransPower gave us a wealth of experience in vehicle controls that we have strengthened since taking ownership in 2020. We're proud to be production ready for our electric powertrain and the full electric system. We're confident in our capabilities and in the important role Meritor will play as commercial vehicles transform over the next decade. This is an incredibly exciting time for us. Now, I'll turn it over to Carl. Well, Sherif. Thanks. That's a great question that I'd love to talk to. So in terms of the relationship that we announced, it's through 2025. But just to put it in perspective across the two platforms on the day cab, and the waste trucks where we're releasing six platforms and to just put it in perspective, that's about somewhere between 1,500 to 1800 components across the power electronics. So the PCAS, the battery management system, as well as the ePowertrain, so in total between the two teams, we brought 10,000 parts to production in a period of 18 months to 24 months, and it's PACCAR saw how complex that process was and obviously was an integral part of working with that. And that integration ties software between obviously the PCAS, the battery system, the powertrain, but also their truck, and all the validation that's gone through that, and we put this into production in December. So certainly, they've seen the value that we've brought to the marketplace with them, and provided as an extension, and it's truly a validation of the value of the Meritor proposition. So we're very proud of it. Well, I think probably a good perspective to start on this Joe, is, is probably off our slide 5, and if look at the fact that we have eight production contracts, half of them coming from the medium duty space and half of them coming from the heavy space. It probably is a good starting point that the customer certainly believe that we have the right building blocks in place. So then going to that slide that the following slide on slide 6 that walks through what did we do across both those spaces. So let me take a minute and walk you through on the full system. So on the full system, as we did in the capital market space we talked a meeting, we talked across the three segments that were approaching this. So when we think about heavy, which is core to Meritor, we invested in TransPower. We acquired it and we used it as the building blocks to not only give us the access to test our product, but also work with customers such as PACCAR to drive that system and bring it to production. And for us to have been able to done that, to do that the number of folks that we have already put in place in Escondido as well as in Detroit seems to have certainly supported that. And it's certainly working for us. So on that side, I believe that we have the right building block to go approach that. On the transit space and the medium duty space, if you notice, we made announcements with BAE to help us on the transit space. And we made announcements with C-Electric to help us with the full system as we focused more on the powertrain. So that's how we focused on how we want to approach the full system capability as well as working with our customers some of which obviously have that system. And on the e-powertrain, we certainly believe again, that we have the right building blocks more because of the wins across all of them. We've announced 14 wins on this side on our motors and inverters. We work with Danfoss, which we believe is a strong partner who obviously has scales on motors. And then we are putting inverter capability internally as well as working with external parties. And again, as this evolves, we will continue to look at M&A. But at this point, based on the validation that we're getting from the customers, we believe we have the right building blocks. And maybe I'll split that up into parts. Joe. I'll answer the question on in terms of finding the talent and retaining the talent, and maybe Carl can pick up what's the cost of it, but in terms of certainly finding the talent and returning the talent part of it is being in Detroit, we certainly have been successful in finding that talent. Our approach with how we acquire TransPower certainly gave us a baseline of folks. And so we were able to build off that. So to this point, we don't seem to have struggled with finding people. In fact, we continue to add and grow in this area. And talking to my CTO, he certainly doesn't seem to be having struggles just this yet, but in terms of costs. So I think obviously maybe you're referring back to about November or December when it's, we saw a little bit of a spike, let's call it to 6% on cancellations on Class 8. But honestly when I look at it, Bruce, the demand is incredibly strong out there. I mean we got 260,000 trucks in the backlog, which is almost a year and we sit here and we look at this current market, and you wonder about the challenges, but if I go back to 2018, which was preparing for the second highest market we've ever seen in 2019 you still had regions that were going the wrong way. So we had India going the wrong way. We saw South America kind of still coming out of the recession. But at this point, when you look at 2021, you got India bouncing back from their weakest. If I go back to South America, they're running at 150,000 trucks up from 109 in 2018/2019 timeframe. In North America if you look at between ACT and FDR, were somewhere between the 285 to 290 the midpoint being 290, our forecast is 280. And you got yet another almost 12 months in backlog. So we see enormous demand and I would say there's the silver lining is once we figured out how to resolve some of the supply chain constraints I do see more of a demand story. I think some of the elements of the cancellations was frankly OEs refloating going forward, as well as fleets just adjusting their order board, because they just can't get anything in the next three to six months. Well, I'll start off, I think we had talked about $500 million or a $0.5 billion in backlog, right through to let's call it the capital markets day. I would say that, obviously, from what we see in forecasts that it's now we're significantly heading north of that. But what we did was we switched from talking about backlogs to now driving defined revenue within the years so that just to give a better perspective of how Meritor approaches things. And so that's the one where in my prepared remarks, I talked about revenue that we've planned for 22 actually being up 30%. And our target for 2025 is $280 million, which we're as we see where the backlog is sitting, we're pretty confident we're certainly seeing a path to hit that plus some as you know, we approach this pretty conservatively as Meritor. So good morning, Brian, love to take that question. So I'm going to break it into three sections. I think the first part really, in terms of the 14Xe and the success rate on the 14Xe. So again, going back to that slide 5, all of that is with the 14Xe with the exception of the MAN announced, the Volkswagen announcement that we have, that's working off what we call an echo axle that's designed to work with a remote mounted system, what with the future, being on a medium duty 12Xe. But everything that we have announced on that page is or let's call it the 14 that we're working on are all working off the 14Xe and then we're super proud of that, because it really shows that I think whether folks are building ground up which are let's call it the new entrants, such as Lion or Volta that have an option of designing whatever technology they want, or the folks that are, let's call it the, the traditional OEMs, whether it's Daimler or whether it's PACCAR or whether it's Autocar they've picked the 14Xe.

            "name": "Carl Anderson",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris and good morning. On today's call, I'll review our first quarter financial results and outlook for fiscal year 2022. Overall, we delivered excellent financial performance to begin the final year of our M2022 plan. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.80. Now let's review the details of our financial results on slide 7. Overall, revenue came in at $984 million, up 11% from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher truck production in most markets as orders remain elevated around the globe. Net income from continuing operations was $54 million compared to $32 million last year. Higher net income was driven by increased sales volumes and lower interest expense, partially offset by net fuel costs. We also benefited from a $6 million settlement with an insurance carrier related to our asbestos liability this quarter. On a comparative basis, you will recall last year we recognize a $6 million onetime gain from our joint venture in Brazil, relating to a value added tax credit. Adjusted EBITDA was $113 million, an increase of $11 million from last year. The growth in adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by higher sales volumes partially offset by net steel costs. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.80, up $0.21 from last year. And finally, free cash flow for the quarter was the use of $39 million compared to $34 million of cash generated last year. The decrease was in line with our expectations as we built higher inventory levels to support an anticipated strong production environment throughout the year. Additionally, incentive compensation payments were higher this year. Now I will discuss our segment results for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Sales in commercial truck were $785 million, up nearly 14% year-over-year. The increase was driven by higher truck production in most global market. Segment adjusted EBITDA for commercial truck was $69 million, up $6 million from last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.8% a slight decrease of 30 basis points from a year ago. Higher sales partially offset by net fuel costs drove an increase to adjusted EBITDA. However, adjusted EBITDA margin was lower as net sale costs impacted sales conversion. Aftermarket industrial sales were $241 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, an increase of $7 million compared to the prior year. Pricing actions executed over the last year in the segment was the primary driver of the improvement in revenue. Segment adjusted EBITDA increased $3 million to $38 million, and EBITDA margin was up 80 basis points to 15.8%. The expansion in segment adjusted EBITDA margin was driven primarily from the footprint optimization initiatives implemented after the first quarter last year.  Now let's review our global production outlook on slide 8. As we saw last quarter demand remained strong across our markets. In the North American Class 8 market the backlog is estimated at approximately 260,000 trucks representing nearly a full year of industry production. While we are closely monitoring constraints in the global supply chain, we are beginning to see some signs of stabilization. We are expecting supply chains to continue to improve as we progress throughout the year. As a result, we are not seeing a significant change from our November view. Therefore, we are maintaining our global production forecast for all markets.  Let's turn to slide 9 for an update to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. Based on first quarter results and our expectations for the rest of the year we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2022 guidance across all of our metrics. We expect revenue to be in a range of $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion based on our unchanged global market assumptions. Additionally, our expectations for adjusted EBITDA margin remains between 11.5% to 12.5%. We continue to plan for pricing actions to help mitigate steel, freight and labor cost pressures. We expect these recoveries to be more fully realized as we progress through the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations remain in a range of $3.25 to $3.75. And finally, our free cash flow guidance is also unchanged with a projected range of $175 million to $200 million. Our first quarter results provide a great foundation for a successful final year of M2022. We remain focused on executing this plan while simultaneously gearing up for M2025. As we approach the start of this new plan, we are forging a path with the coming electrification of the commercial vehicle industry. The road ahead is blue. Now we will take your questions. Yes, thanks Sherif. Yes, for the entire quarter steel was actually about a $24 million net headwind for us with the vast majority of that close to $20 million really affecting the commercial truck segment. And as we look forward, we think steel will continue to be a headwind for the rest of this year. But the next big step of that probably will be in the second quarter. And then as we look forward for the second half, we do believe, based off the trend line we're seeing in steel prices that we'll start seeing that the impact really starts to decline as we get in the second half. Yes, Sharif, I'll take that one. For sure, I mean, based on I think where we're seeing demand, the supply chain has improved from Q4 to Q1, but to your point that's not resolved. And I would say, certainly, as we see from Q1 to Q2 we do see more stabilization. And it's probably too early to declare a victory. And you do see over time this continuing to improve. But at this point, we certainly do see an improvement, both from a supply chain standpoint, and let's call it more from our customers. Customers getting far more comfortable with their ability to get chips or understand their chip supply and also forecast better. As you can also see with PACCAR's announcement, and taking the number of offline trucks, they're obviously starting to get more chips in the system. So we do see that improving but again, probably too early to declare victory. Yes, Joe as mentioned in the strategy day if I look forward from an R&D perspective, we are looking at increasing that quite substantially probably close to 30%, from what our current run rate has been. But I think the other planning assumption and how we're running the companies, we are looking at pivoting some of our expense and costs we are that we support the traditional business into what we're doing on electrification. So I think it's all embedded in our planning assumptions as we look to drive the M2025. So that you're absolutely right, you'll see that cost increase as relates to all the efforts we're doing there, but we're also doing a lot where we'll be reducing some of the costs on our traditional products as well. It has. So I think from a forecast perspective we were planning originally to have steel decline throughout the year when we last spoke in November. I would say that where I see spot prices today, they are coming in a little bit lower than what we originally were planning for. But from a lag perspective, obviously, steel is still a significant headwind for us this quarter as I referenced earlier. We expect that also to happen in the second quarter, and then you'll start seeing that kind of normalize, as we kind of get into the second half of our fiscal year. It could be, it could turn into a year-over-year positive depending on where the spot prices kind of come to, and it does get. There's that lag effect, as you referenced before, depending on most of our contracts somewhere it's three to six months. So it depends. But yes, that would be our expectation at this point."

With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.\nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of 2023 and discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and then I'll finish with the discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance and our forecast for this year. As I reflect back on 2023, I am incredibly proud of what Cummins and our employees accomplished for our stakeholders and I feel energized about the opportunities ahead for us as we continue to demonstrate our relentless focus on being a global leader in clean energy technology and innovation. We made significant progress in achieving our Destination Zero strategy and it continues to be clear that this dual path approach to reducing greenhouse gas and air quality impacts of our products is the right approach to meet our customers' needs today and continue to grow our business and impact. We did this by advancing our core business as well as developing new zero emission solutions through Accelera by Cummins. Most notably, for our core business in 2023, we committed to investing more than $1 billion across our US engine manufacturing network to support the industry's first fuel-agnostic engine and platforms, as well as unveiled the X10 fuel-agnostic series launching in North America in 2026. Additionally, we initiated several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine, which will launch in North America this year and further enables our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. This is the industry's first natural gas engine design specifically for heavy duty and on-highway truck applications, offering customers the opportunity to realize reductions in nitrous oxide and greenhouse gas without compromising performance. We are continuing to see strong interest from both OEMs and end users ahead of the launch later this year. In our Accelera business, we announced a joint venture with Daimler Trucks and Buses, PACCAR, and EVE Energy to accelerate and localize battery self-production and the battery supply chain in the US. We further announced this quarter the selection of Marshall County, Mississippi for the 21-gigawatt-hour factory that is expected to create more than 2,000 US manufacturing jobs with production anticipated to begin in 2027. Accelera also reached a further milestone this year of electrolyzer order backlog, totalling over $500 million. In order to meet the growing electrolyzer demand, we began production at our first US manufacturing location for electrolyzers in the Cummins Power Generation Facility in Fridley, Minnesota. Lastly, we are resolute about the leading role we play in the energy transition, and emissions compliance continues to be a critical element of this work and central to our values. We were transparent about this in December when we announced that we reached an agreement and principle to resolve US regulatory claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process for certain engines, primarily used in our pickup truck applications. After 4.5 years of working diligently with the regulators, reaching an agreement was the best way for us to achieve certainty on this matter and move forward with certifying our new products and advancing our Destination Zero strategy. We have expanded and strengthened our emissions compliance program to help ensure our products comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations around the world. Our product compliance and regulatory affairs organization, which we launched in 2019, has a reporting line directly to me and positions come as to meet global product compliance requirements and deliver solutions for our customers that are safe and lead to a cleaner environment. Now I will comment on overall company performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for this quarter totalled $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% compared to 2022, driven by strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was a loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% compared to positive $1.1 billion or 14.2% a year ago. Fourth quarter 2023 results included $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve US regulatory claims, $42 million of costs related to a voluntary retirement and separation program, and $33 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. This compares to the fourth quarter 2022 results, which included $19 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5%. EBITDA dollars increased from a year ago as increased pricing and higher volumes more than offset increased selling, administrative research and development expenses and inflation costs. Research and development expense increased in the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the engine, components and Accelera segments. In addition, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 was very strong at $1.5 billion compared to $817 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on working capital management within the business. 2023 revenues were a record $34.1 billion, 21% higher than 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was $3 billion or 8.9% of sales compared to $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales in 2022. 2023 results include $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve US regulatory claims, the voluntary headcount reduction program I noted previously, and $100 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. This compares to our 2022 results, which included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia and $81 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was a record $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023 compared to $4 billion or 14.2% of sales for 2022, as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded increased selling, administrative, research and development and inflation costs. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in the distribution, components and power systems segments. Our Power Systems business in particular finished 2023 with a full year EBITDA of 14.7% of sales, up from 12.2% in 2022. This segment completed the first year of their focused business transformation effort, and the improvement in performance is encouraging. You will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year. In addition to our segments, Meritor finished 2023 with full year EBITDA of 10.8% of sales, up from 7.4% in 2022, as our employees did a tremendous job of executing value capture opportunities across the business. I'm very pleased with the performance of Cummins Meritor to date as we continue our program to improve margins in that business and expand its global reach. In addition, operating cash flow for 2023 was a record of $4 billion, a significant increase from $2 billion in 2022. I'm proud of our leaders and employees efforts in 2023 as they helped deliver on one of our primary focus areas. Strong cash generation will continue to be a top priority moving forward. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2024 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2024 guidance continues to include Atmus for the full year, but excludes any costs or benefits associated with the planned separation of that business. We are forecasting total company revenue for 2024 to be down 2% to 5% compared to 2023, and EBITDA to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales, as we anticipate slowing demand in some of our key regions and markets, particularly North America heavy duty truck. Early in 2024, we expect the heavy duty market to continue at its current rate, which is slightly off the peak of the first half of 2023, with further softening in our forecast in the second half of the year. Industry production for heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2024, a 10% to 15% decline year-over-year. In medium duty truck market, we expect market size to be 140,000 units to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat compared to 2023. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 units to 145,000 units in 2024, a 5% to 10% decline year-over-year as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024. We're projecting a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy duty and medium duty truck demand, and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% in demand in light duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and moderating export demand. Despite this slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we expect to see continued strong performance for the 15 liter natural gas engine as we achieved approximately 20% share for 2023 in the heavy duty market. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we expect a 5% to 15% decline year over year, primarily driven by weak property investment and shrinking export demand in China. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024. Revenues in the global power generation market are expected to increase 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, while the small market for us, demand for oil and gas engines, is expected to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America. And for aftermarket, we expect a range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2024, as we expect to be largely through inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. In Accelera, we expect full-year sales to be $450 million to $500 million, compared to the $354 million in 2023. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to deliver over the course of the next 12 months to 18 months, as well as expect continued growth in electrified components. In summary, 2023 was a record year for revenues and operating cash flow, excluding the impacts related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims. 2023 was also a record year for EBITDA, net income, and earnings per share. While 2023 revenues were at the high end of our expectations, we anticipate moderating demand in North America truck production in the second half of 2024. We expect this moderating demand to be partially offset by a strong power generation market, resiliency in our distribution business, given the strong aftermarket presence, and improved Accelera sales. In addition, we are taking steps to reduce costs, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. As I close, I would like to officially announce that our Analyst Day is now scheduled for May 16 in New York City. I look forward to further discussing our strategy and expect invitations to be sent out shortly. Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark?\nMark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. I will acknowledge I have a heavy cold this morning. So if I sound more dour than usual and a little rougher, please take that into consideration. We delivered solid operational results in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations for revenue and delivering EBITDA margins in line with our guidance. Compared to 2022, our full year sales grew 21% and our operating cash flow more than doubled to a record $4 billion, reflecting the strong focus of our employees on meeting customer demand and improving working capital. Now let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion and EBITDA was a net loss of $878 million, or negative 10.3% of sales. For the full year, we reported revenues of a record $34.1 billion and EBITDA was $3 billion, or 8.9% of sales. As Jen mentioned, we recorded a one-time charge of $2.04 billion in Q4 to settle the previously disclosed US regulatory claims. Fourth quarter results also included $42 million of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs. Costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus were $33 million in the fourth quarter and $100 million for the full year, compares to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a total of $81 million in the previous year. Full year 2022 results also included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2023 full year operational performance of our business, I am now excluding the costs associated with the regulatory settlement, voluntary retirement separation programs, planned separation of Atmus and the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 8%, driven by improved pricing across multiple end markets and stronger demand for power generation products. International revenues increased 13%, driven by strong global power gen demand, particularly for data centers. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales for the quarter, compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5% of sales a year ago. Improved pricing was offset by higher compensation costs, increased investment and development, and capabilities in our Accelera segment. Higher variable compensation costs were driven primarily by stronger operating cash flow, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the full year. Now I'll go into each line item with a little bit more detail. Gross margin was $2 billion or 23.7% of sales, an increase of $201 million or 30 basis points from the prior year. The improved margins were driven by favourable pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by higher product coverage costs and compensation expenses. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $154 million or 15% as we continue to invest in the development of new products that will drive future growth and also due to higher variable compensation costs. Joint venture income increased $25 million due to slowly recovering demand in China from a low base in 2022. Other income was $50 million, an increase of $17 million from a year ago, primarily due to the recovery of technology fees from customers in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $92 million, an increase of $5 million from the prior year driven by higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of our debt. The all in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was negative 13.3%, principally due to non-deductible costs associated with the regulatory settlement. All in net loss for the quarter was $1.4 billion or negative $10.01 per diluted share, which includes $2.04 billion or $13.76 per diluted share of costs associated with the regulatory settlement, $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs, and $33 million or $0.17 per diluted share of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. Operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.5 billion, $642 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven by strong earnings and a lower expansion of our working capital across the business. For the full year 2023, revenues were a record $34.1 billion, up 21% or $6 billion from a year ago, driven by the inclusion of a full year of Meritor results and strong organic growth. Sales in North America increased 22% and international sales increased 20%. Within those numbers, organic sales growth was 12%, driven by improved pricing, strong global demand for power generation products, continued strength in the North American truck market, and slowly improving economic conditions in China. EBITDA for the year was $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023, an increase of $1.2 billion or 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase in EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes, favourable pricing and logistics costs, and a modest and favourable mark-to-market impact from investments that underpin our company-owned life insurance plans, all of that partially offset by higher compensation expenses. All in-net earnings were $735 million or $5.15 per diluted share, compared to $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share a year ago. 2023 net earnings include $2.04 billion or $13.78 per diluted share of costs related to the regulatory settlement, $100 million or $0.54 per diluted share of costs related to the separation of Atmus, and $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs related to the voluntary separation programs that we implemented during the fourth quarter. Full-year cash from operations was a record inflow of $4 billion, doubling from a year ago as a result of higher operating income and much lower expansion of working capital across the company. Capital expenditures in 2023 were $1.2 billion, in line with our forecast, and an increase of $297 million from 2022, as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to drive growth, particularly related to the fuel agnostic platforms within our core business. Our long-term goal is to deliver at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders, and over the past five years we've returned 56% of operating cash flow in the form of share purchases and dividends. In 2023, we focused our capital allocation on organic investments and dividend growth, returning $921 million to shareholders via the dividend, and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor. We currently expect that our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will mirror those of last year. I'll now summarise the 2023 results for the operating segments and provide guidance for 2024. If I need to say it again, I will, that the results that I'm going to discuss going forward exclude the costs related to the separation of Atmus, the cost associated with the voluntary retirement and separation, and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in 2022. Component segment revenues were a record $13.4 billion, 38% higher than the prior year. EBITDA was 14.4% of sales compared to 14.2%, an increase of $540 million, or 40%. For 2024, we expect total revenue for the components business to decrease 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.9%. For the Engine segment, 2023 revenues increased 7% to a record $11.7 billion and EBITDA was 14.1% of sales, compared to 14.3% a year ago. In dollar terms, EBITDA increased $74 million or 5%. In 2024, we project revenues for the engine business will decrease 2% to 7% due to expected moderation in the North American heavy-duty truck market, most likely in the second half, or most prominently in the second half of the year. 2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. In the distribution segment revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $10.2 billion and EBITDA increased by 28% and improved as a percent of sales to 11.8% compared to 10.6% a year ago. We expect distribution revenues to be between down 3% and up 2% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.4% to 12.4% for the full year. In the power system segment, revenues were also a record at $5.7 billion or 13% higher than last year. EBITDA was 14.7% or 250 basis points higher than 2022 driven by favourable pricing, strong volume and certain cost reduction actions. In 2024 we expect Power Systems revenues to be down 3% to up 2% and EBITDA in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%. Accelera revenues increased $354 million in 2023 with a net loss at the EBITDA level of $443 million. In 2024, we expect Accelera revenues and now we anticipate that Accelera revcenue will increase in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to reduce to between $400 million and $430 million as we continue to make targeted investments in future technologies, whilst improving the operating performance of our current products. We currently project 2024 company revenues to be down 2% to 5% and company EBITDA margins in the range of 14.4% to 15.4%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in 2024 excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will likely be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion as we continue to make critical investments to support future growth. To summarize, we delivered record sales and strong operating profits in 2023. Cash generation has been and will continue to be a strong focus as we enter 2024, enabling us to continue investing in new products even during times of economic uncertainty, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. As Jen indicated, we do expect moderation in several of our key markets in 2024, especially in the US truck market as reflected in our guidance. We have already taken actions to reduce costs in the business and are in a good situation to navigate the economic cycle and improve our cycle over cycle performance in 2024. Subject to our mark-to-market conditions, our intention is to split the remaining ownership in Atmus through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation as we seek to reposition our portfolio for the future. As part of the proposed exchange offer, common shareholders will have the choice to exchange all, some or none of their shares of Cummins' stock for shares of Atmus common stock subject to the terms of the offer. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as in the coming days. Our guidance for Cummins for this year assumes the inclusion of Atmus in our consolidated results for the entirety of 2024 and excludes any costs or benefits of the separation. The benefits to Cummins are expected to include a lower number of shares outstanding upon completion of the exchange. We will update our guidance as and when the separation is completed. Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.\nChris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. Jennifer, Mark, Chris, so normally when you folks have new engine regulations, we tend to see higher margins from you folks. I know we're a couple of years out from the 27 regulations, but can you just share some high-level thoughts? It looks like the average selling price of the engine could double given that embedded warranty increase and I'm wondering if you'd just comment on that and then broadly just talk about the parameters of how do you expect the dynamic to play out for your business compared to the margin expansion we've seen on prior emission cycles where you folks have increased your value add. Thanks.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, thanks for that question, Jerry. So as you've seen from us in the past, as we launch product with new emissions regulations, typically we see a content increase, of course, and then also look at creating value for our customers and have an opportunity to price accordingly with them. So we are looking to continue to do that as we launch new products, in particular, these fuel agnostic engine platforms. Of course, we also typically see a bump up in our warranty costs because we are beginning to accrue in at a high rate until we've demonstrated capability of that platform. So that's the other factor to watch as we launch those products, but what you see us doing right now is really focusing on improving operating performance of the business, as well as investing in the key platforms for the future that we believe will bring value to our customers and position the company for profitable growth.\nJerry Revich: Okay, super. And then can I ask separately, given the high logistics costs that the industry saw in 2023, can you comment on where your labor hours per unit stand today versus normal? And to what extent could that be a source of upside relative to the guide?\nChris Clulow: Yeah, Jerry, I think that has been, as we've progressed through 2023, continue to drive more and more efficiency. Some of the supply chain hiccups that we have experienced are beginning to iron out, we're getting better on time to delivery, and that does allow us to drive more efficiency in our plants. So I think we are continuing to see that as we progress through the latter half of the year. As we expect, as both Jen and Mark mentioned, volumes to particularly in the North America heavy duty truck space come down a bit and moderate a bit, we can continue to drive those efficiencies. So I think the cost per labor hour will continue to get better and I would say the overall costs on labor have somewhat levelled out. We went through, as you know, a long period of them rising and through the course of the last six months that has settled down and become much more of a flat.\nMark Smith: Yeah, I would say in the near term, there's a little bit of increased anxiety about events in the Middle East and some shipping delays and some reversing of the trend we've seen in logistics costs, which have been actually going down for us, Jerry. I don't want to overstate that, it's obviously is a little bit of a concern in the near term.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nTim Thein: Maybe just one bit of a clarification, but on the comments on for engine shipments in North America for on highway, I think you said 140,000 down 5% to 10%. Is that -- was that relative to the total North heavy and medium duty market, or was that a comment just on heavy duty in terms of?\nMark Smith: Yeah, on the medium duty, Tim, we had a down, down 5% to flat, and that's 140,000 to 150,000. The heavy duty market, we have it down at 10% to 15% and that's our guide for the year.\nJennifer Rumsey: And I'll just give a little color. This has been an unusual cycle, I think, in the '21, '22 timeframe and supply constraints that prevented the industry from fully meeting customer demand and that has improved over the course of 2023. We saw the markets peak really in the second quarter and saw some slight drop off in the second half, but to the high end of our guide, it was not as much as we had forecast going into Q1. Backlogs look strong, in particular, feeling quite good about the medium duty market and continuing to watch what happens. We are still predicting a shallow cycle and further softening as we go into the second half of the year. So that, just some color behind those numbers is how I would describe that.\nTim Thein: Okay, I had a question on kind of what that implied in terms of the market share, but I can follow up with Chris after and then maybe the second one is just on the implied decrementals for the engine segment in '24 and obviously, the kind of a high 30% number, the JV income will certainly be a drag on that, but maybe with not to go through every single piece, but the parts headwind was pronounced in '23 for Cummins and I'm just curious for that piece, specifically, you outlined that the guidance for the off highway parts outlook, but for that and anything else that maybe you'd call out that's relevant to the year-over-year margin performance for engines? Thank you.\nMark Smith: Yeah, good, good question, Tim and the main thing that you didn't cover there was just our assumptions around product coverage. We're not expecting any significant change, but baked into our guidance is a little bit higher product coverage or warranty as a percent of sales in the engine business. We'll see how that plays out, but, that's the other factor that's in there that you didn't list.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nDavid Raso: Hi, thank you. Just sort of a bigger picture question, I know there's been a lot of costs involved and you're right in the thick, of course, call it a decade long energy transition that there's a lot of expenses. I'm just curious, if you look out over the next year or two, is there an inflection point that you see your cost begin to recede and if not, is there a thought of maybe a larger cost out program? I recognize the separation program you discussed, but just something maybe more substantial size, just given relative to other names we look at, they've had a real strong run on profitability the last couple years and it's been a little more of a challenge for your margin. So just curious if you see something on the horizon that really changes that, be it cost inflection, or maybe an idea you've proactively taken, sorry, spend inflection coming down, or something on the cost side that maybe you can do. Thank you.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, David, thanks. Thanks for the question. And first, I'll say, I think you said decade long energy transition, I would just put an S on that decades long, right? It's going to take time. The reality is, if you look across our different markets and regions, it's going to take time for that transition to occur. We are in a period, though, of really peak investment in the engine business. As we invest in these fuel agnostic engine platforms, we've got a major investment in R&D and capital to do that. And we think that those engines are going to really position us well with high efficiency diesel products as customers have and continue to decide not to invest in their own platforms and to use Cummins and then also the fuel flexibility that will help customers as they begin to transition, whether its natural gas or hydrogen-based engine solutions. And so the next few years until we launch those platforms in the '26, '27 timeframe, we're seeing higher levels of R&D in those products and then, of course, we're also in a period where we've got somewhat lower revenue and higher investments in the accelerator business and we are pacing that investment based on how we see the market moving. We're looking at opportunities to share investments while having a leading solution, like you saw us do with the battery cell joint venture. As revenues grow, we improve parts of those businesses and electrified components. We've now delivered 1500 buses with Bluebird and ramping up the electrolyzer that will help improve margin performance of the business there. And then the last thing I'd say is, as Cummins has done, and we will continue to do, we're looking at how do we improve different parts of our business and so following the acquisition of the North America distribution business, we had a focused investment on improving margin there and you see that playing out in the distribution business performance and I talked about the focus last year that started in our power systems business. You see that playing out there, the Meritor integration, and we're continuing to look at places that we can improve operating performance of our business and then watch market demands and cost and so the voluntary reduction actions that we took last year help us as we see some reduction in revenue this year. So all those things come together to allow us to continue to improve our returns to investors while making sure we're investing in key products and technologies for the future. \nDavid Raso: All right, thank you. And just a minute real quick, and I'll hop off. The cadence of the declines in North America truck that you're looking to experience as the year goes on, can you give us a little sense of the cadence, maybe from an industry perspective, and would your declines, the cadence be any different? Just the idea of the lead lag between what's in inventory, how early you ship, just trying to get a sense for the cadence and how you relate to the industry cadence. Thank you.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, great. So, obviously, there's some lead that we have in supplying engines into truck build. So our engine build rates will slightly lead truck build rates, but as I said earlier, from a guide perspective, we think where we were running as we ended the year is going to hold pretty steady through the first part of the year and then we're forecasting some softening toward the end of second quarter and into the second half of the year.\nMark Smith: In a medium duty truck, there really isn't that much difference between the two, and market and hours and then heavy duty, that's where we see a little bit more vulnerability for the market and would largely expect us to move in line with the market.\nJennifer Rumsey: And then the last dynamic is in pickup, we've got the product changeover that'll drive Q4 volumes lower and pickup.\nOperator: Our next question is from Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nAngel Castillo: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to unpack that cadence for the second half a little bit more. I think last quarter you had indicated aftermarket was an area that maybe was giving you a bit of a signal that there was a bit of a softening. And I think you indicated that things came in maybe the higher end of your expectations, and you kind of see that continuing into the first half. So as we kind of position that second half slowdown and now an expectation for aftermarket to actually pick up from the kind of flat to up 5% through the year, can you tell us, I guess, what you're seeing in terms of customer commentary and any kind of signs or what kind of gives you confidence in that second half slowdown as we think about the year?\nMark Smith: Yeah, I'll have a go -- first go at that question. First of all, I'll just say on aftermarket, we saw a very pronounced, I would say some element of de-stocking or lower production across our lower demand in parts in Q4, which we largely attribute to customer cash flow management. We don't expect that to be a continuing trend. We expect to recover from Q4 levels on parts and be pretty steady across the year. On the truck builds, well, of course, you've heard from most of our major customers. So we really don't have much more to say other than the backlog of trucks has been slowly edging down and then the thing that gives us the broader concern is the spot rates and the health of the truck fleet operators. That's our principal concern. It's not our OEM customers and right now that the backlog and the orders still continue at quite decent levels. It's what's happening to the underlying economics of freight activity. That's what's giving us the concern combined, which hasn't been moving in the right direction, combined with the slowly easing heavy duty backlog. So it isn't a kind of pronounced downturn we might have seen in prior cycles at this point, but those are the factors that are weighing into our consideration and I think our guidance isn't more conservative than anybody else's and we don't have any other observations beyond those really.\nAngel Castillo: Got it. That's helpful and then maybe pivoting to Accelera, I just wanted to maybe unpack that a little bit in terms of curious what you're seeing in the backlog trends from 3Q to 4Q and as you kind of deliver on at least the electrolyzers over the next 12 months to 18 months, can you talk to us, I guess, about the cadence of the profitability of that business? We kind of exit 2024 and you start to have higher deliveries on those and maybe what you kind of foresee the exit rate will be in terms of that profitability?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, so we are in a period of still pretty heavy investment in Accelera businesses are really making both R&D and manufacturing investments to scale up the product and we're fortunate we have, existing plant and data that we can invest within to do that, to begin to produce electrolyzers and we continue to see growing demand and backlog is, as I noted, at a record level for electrolyzers. So that production rate is going to begin to grow and then you'll see margin performance in the electrolyzer portion of the business improving as the revenues grow and we deliver that backlog out into the market. Same thing in our electrified components business as we see revenue growth there. You'll see margin performance improving. One thing we have now included in our 2024 investment, of course, is beginning to invest in the battery cell joint venture and we believe that, that is a key investment that we're making together to ensure we have a leading cell for commercial vehicles here in the U.S. and domestic supply, which will both allow us and our customers to take advantage of incentives that are available and ensure security of supply over time into this market.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed.\nRob Wertheimer: Yeah, hi. I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on what's happening in the data center and large engine market. Obviously, it's very strong. I don't know how many years of visibility you have or what that market looks like. Your primary competitor announced a capacity expansion. I don't know where your capacity and your room to grow into that market if it is, a multiyear kind of curve. So I wonder if you could kind of give us an update on dynamics there.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, the data center market is an exciting growth market, has been for several years a trend with increasing cloud, data storage in the cloud and now with artificial intelligence and other investments. We continue to see very strong demand. We guided up 10% to 15%. Backlog for that market is very, very strong. We're looking at our capacity to make sure that we can meet the market demand and feeling good about the product offering that we have and of course, that business and the focus on improving underlying performance of that business will help us as that market grows.\nMark Smith: Probably the clearest secular trend over the next couple of years.\nJennifer Rumsey: I don't. Yeah, I think it will continue.\nRob Wertheimer: And then do you have room to grow in '25 and '26? Maybe not sure too much on your capacity, but it seems as though you're probably, you're probably being asked to quote or to think about, capacitor that far out, right.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, I will just say we expect that that trend of data center market growth will continue and we are and we'll continue to look at our capacity and how we position to meet that demand.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Perfect. I'll stop there. If I can sneak one more in on medium duty, there's a bit of a narrative that as the COVID constrained production, the OEMs prioritized large class state over the medium duty and that's reflected somewhat in industry outlooks in your out. I'm just wondering if medium duty has more inherent demand than that being helped by interest rates or anything else, or if that's kind of where the market is kind of flattish? I'll stop there.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah. There were certainly the OEMs experienced a number of supply chain constraints and continued in '23 and even into the early part of this year, frame rails in particular. So we are, as you as you saw, really expect the medium duty market to continue to hold pretty flat to where it is now. It's quite strong. We, of course, have a strong position in that market and we're seeing continued demand and pent-up demand from some of the customers in that market for our product. So less often in there than heavy duty.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I think you highlighted DV [ph] adoption scenarios at your last Analyst Day. As of today, I know you're hosting another Analyst Day this year, but as of today, which scenario, the fast versus slow, seems more likely? And how do you think that affects your Accelera target of $6 billion to $13 billion revenue by 2030? Any updates on that?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, as you said, we did a kind of a low and a high scenario for adoption at our last Analyst Day and you can expect that we're going to refresh our view of that as we go into the Analyst Day in May. What I would say is that, there are regulations and incentives that are helping to start to drive that adoption, maybe more towards the lower end of those scenarios is what we would think and we are continuing to look at pacing of investment to make sure that we're managing that in line with how we see adoption actually occurring.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. So if it's more leaning toward, let's say, the slower version, does that have a dampening or somewhat negative or slowing impact on the Accelera targets that you have out there?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, we're still within, it would still fall within the range that we gave in the Analyst Day, consistent with those range of scenarios that we suggested and recall that, a large portion of that revenue in 2030 for Accelera is in the growth of the electrolyzer business as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks so much. First off, a housekeeping question. I'm trying to understand cash flow dynamics as we exit the year and the leverage profile. Obviously the settlement impacts that a bit, but, you typically have a target to return 30% of cash flow to shareholders. How are we thinking about return to capital this year and where you're kind of aiming to end the year on leverage?\nMark Smith: Yeah, so morning, Noah. So we're going to start the year with the same stance as last year, invest in the business, dividend focus and some more de-levering. That's the way we start in the year. We'll continue to evaluate that with our board as we see how the cycle unfolds. At least that's our initial stance. Of course, part of our, in years where we've generated more cash than we've needed, then we've returned significantly more than the 50% in any given year, but anyway, we think this is the approach right now until we see a little bit more on the cycle.\nNoah Kaye: All right. So you do expect to de-lever as we get to the end of the year.\nMark Smith: Yes.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. And then just the guide for China truck seems a bit wide. Can you kind of talk us through the low end and the high end of the range in terms of the scenarios you're envisioning? Is it high end contingent on stimulus? Walk us through what you're seeing and assuming.\nChris Clulow: Yeah. That really reflects low visibility, right? So we've come off a very weak base, but there just isn't clear signals yet from the market as to what's actually going to happen. So we can build a case. It's hard for me to think of a case that's a lot lower than where we are today, but just the overall pace of the economy continues to be sluggish and so that upside really leaves room for something unexpected on the stimulus side, which has happened from time to time in China, but we don't have brilliant insight at this point in time. The outlook is cloudy and the conviction from OEMs is not quite there yet. We're doing well with our customers, launching more products. We're bullish on continuing to outgrow in the market in China, both consolidated revenues and in the performance of the JVs. We're all set to outperform. We just need a little bit of help from the market overall, but it's not as tangible as we'd like at the start of the year. Of course, we'll look at the same data points and provide you with an update. Hopefully, by the end of Q1, we tend to have a stronger view of the. And my voice is done for the rest of the morning.\nJennifer Rumsey: Chris and I will answer the rest of the questions.\nChris Clulow: We'll see how much it clears on China.\nOperator: Our final question is from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nMichael Feniger: Yeah. Thank you guys for squeezing me in. Just the share count's been kind of flat to slightly up. There's a comment in the release about a focus on debt reduction, payment of dividends. Can you just flesh out the priorities in 2024, because I know Mark mentioned with Atmus, I heard buybacks. Just maybe you can reiterate the framework of how we should kind of think about Atmus in 2024 as we move through the years, some of the puts and takes there.\nMark Smith: The main impacts of Atmus operation will be obviously, they'll set off on their own pursuing their growth strategy and as this final step, we will swap Cummins shares for -- investors will retire Cummins shares in exchange for Atmus shares. So our share count will go down if the exchange is successful. The reason our share count here in the past 18 months hasn't been changing or drifting up is because we stopped the share repurchase as well. We de-levered post the Meritor acquisition, which we've been telegraphing to investors. We've got a little bit more of deleveraging to go, and then we'll continue to evaluate whether we, what our opportunities are to generate the best returns for investors, either through organic growth or through more capital returns, but that's the basic way it's going to work. The share count will go down on the separation.\nMichael Feniger: Fair enough. And Mark, I want to let you go and get better. Just quick question for you is just on Meritor, I think '23, I think there's revenue about $4.8 billion, maybe EBITDA a little bit above $500 million. Just when we think of the guide for '24 on components, anything you can help us unpack about how that Meritor in '23, how that kind of trends in '24 relative to your overall components guide? Thanks everyone.\nMark Smith: Got it. And I will say I'm feeling better than I sound, and that's largely because of the record cash flow. So please, as I said at the start, don't read into my breaking voice. Meritor achieved the goals we had for this year. It is not a segment on its own. We provided that data for the first full year for transparency purposes to make sure investors had a read on how we were doing after a little bit of a bumpy start when we first acquired Meritor. So that's all rolled into the guidance, but it's safe to say we've got further improvement in Meritor going into 2024 and we're really pleased with how the team is doing there, Ken Hogan and his team. So we're excited about that going forward. So thank you. Thanks everybody. Appreciate it.\nOperator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris for closing comments.\nChris Clulow: Thank you, everybody. That concludes our teleconference for the day. I appreciate all of you participating and your continued interest. As always, our Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. I will acknowledge I have a heavy cold this morning. So if I sound more dour than usual and a little rougher, please take that into consideration. We delivered solid operational results in the fourth quarter, exceeding our expectations for revenue and delivering EBITDA margins in line with our guidance. Compared to 2022, our full year sales grew 21% and our operating cash flow more than doubled to a record $4 billion, reflecting the strong focus of our employees on meeting customer demand and improving working capital. Now let me go into more details on the fourth quarter and full year performance. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion and EBITDA was a net loss of $878 million, or negative 10.3% of sales. For the full year, we reported revenues of a record $34.1 billion and EBITDA was $3 billion, or 8.9% of sales. As Jen mentioned, we recorded a one-time charge of $2.04 billion in Q4 to settle the previously disclosed US regulatory claims. Fourth quarter results also included $42 million of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs. Costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus were $33 million in the fourth quarter and $100 million for the full year, compares to $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a total of $81 million in the previous year. Full year 2022 results also included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia. To provide clarity on the fourth quarter and 2023 full year operational performance of our business, I am now excluding the costs associated with the regulatory settlement, voluntary retirement separation programs, planned separation of Atmus and the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments. Q4 revenues were $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 8%, driven by improved pricing across multiple end markets and stronger demand for power generation products. International revenues increased 13%, driven by strong global power gen demand, particularly for data centers. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales for the quarter, compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5% of sales a year ago. Improved pricing was offset by higher compensation costs, increased investment and development, and capabilities in our Accelera segment. Higher variable compensation costs were driven primarily by stronger operating cash flow, which exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the full year. Now I'll go into each line item with a little bit more detail. Gross margin was $2 billion or 23.7% of sales, an increase of $201 million or 30 basis points from the prior year. The improved margins were driven by favourable pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by higher product coverage costs and compensation expenses. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $154 million or 15% as we continue to invest in the development of new products that will drive future growth and also due to higher variable compensation costs. Joint venture income increased $25 million due to slowly recovering demand in China from a low base in 2022. Other income was $50 million, an increase of $17 million from a year ago, primarily due to the recovery of technology fees from customers in the fourth quarter. Interest expense was $92 million, an increase of $5 million from the prior year driven by higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of our debt. The all in effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was negative 13.3%, principally due to non-deductible costs associated with the regulatory settlement. All in net loss for the quarter was $1.4 billion or negative $10.01 per diluted share, which includes $2.04 billion or $13.76 per diluted share of costs associated with the regulatory settlement, $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs associated with the voluntary retirement and separation programs, and $33 million or $0.17 per diluted share of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. Operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.5 billion, $642 million higher than the fourth quarter last year, driven by strong earnings and a lower expansion of our working capital across the business. For the full year 2023, revenues were a record $34.1 billion, up 21% or $6 billion from a year ago, driven by the inclusion of a full year of Meritor results and strong organic growth. Sales in North America increased 22% and international sales increased 20%. Within those numbers, organic sales growth was 12%, driven by improved pricing, strong global demand for power generation products, continued strength in the North American truck market, and slowly improving economic conditions in China. EBITDA for the year was $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023, an increase of $1.2 billion or 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase in EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes, favourable pricing and logistics costs, and a modest and favourable mark-to-market impact from investments that underpin our company-owned life insurance plans, all of that partially offset by higher compensation expenses. All in-net earnings were $735 million or $5.15 per diluted share, compared to $2.2 billion or $15.12 per diluted share a year ago. 2023 net earnings include $2.04 billion or $13.78 per diluted share of costs related to the regulatory settlement, $100 million or $0.54 per diluted share of costs related to the separation of Atmus, and $42 million or $0.22 per diluted share of costs related to the voluntary separation programs that we implemented during the fourth quarter. Full-year cash from operations was a record inflow of $4 billion, doubling from a year ago as a result of higher operating income and much lower expansion of working capital across the company. Capital expenditures in 2023 were $1.2 billion, in line with our forecast, and an increase of $297 million from 2022, as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to drive growth, particularly related to the fuel agnostic platforms within our core business. Our long-term goal is to deliver at least 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders, and over the past five years we've returned 56% of operating cash flow in the form of share purchases and dividends. In 2023, we focused our capital allocation on organic investments and dividend growth, returning $921 million to shareholders via the dividend, and debt reduction following the acquisition of Meritor. We currently expect that our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will mirror those of last year. I'll now summarise the 2023 results for the operating segments and provide guidance for 2024. If I need to say it again, I will, that the results that I'm going to discuss going forward exclude the costs related to the separation of Atmus, the cost associated with the voluntary retirement and separation, and the costs associated with the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia in 2022. Component segment revenues were a record $13.4 billion, 38% higher than the prior year. EBITDA was 14.4% of sales compared to 14.2%, an increase of $540 million, or 40%. For 2024, we expect total revenue for the components business to decrease 2% to 7% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 13.9% to 14.9%. For the Engine segment, 2023 revenues increased 7% to a record $11.7 billion and EBITDA was 14.1% of sales, compared to 14.3% a year ago. In dollar terms, EBITDA increased $74 million or 5%. In 2024, we project revenues for the engine business will decrease 2% to 7% due to expected moderation in the North American heavy-duty truck market, most likely in the second half, or most prominently in the second half of the year. 2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. In the distribution segment revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $10.2 billion and EBITDA increased by 28% and improved as a percent of sales to 11.8% compared to 10.6% a year ago. We expect distribution revenues to be between down 3% and up 2% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.4% to 12.4% for the full year. In the power system segment, revenues were also a record at $5.7 billion or 13% higher than last year. EBITDA was 14.7% or 250 basis points higher than 2022 driven by favourable pricing, strong volume and certain cost reduction actions. In 2024 we expect Power Systems revenues to be down 3% to up 2% and EBITDA in the range of 15.2% to 16.2%. Accelera revenues increased $354 million in 2023 with a net loss at the EBITDA level of $443 million. In 2024, we expect Accelera revenues and now we anticipate that Accelera revcenue will increase in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to reduce to between $400 million and $430 million as we continue to make targeted investments in future technologies, whilst improving the operating performance of our current products. We currently project 2024 company revenues to be down 2% to 5% and company EBITDA margins in the range of 14.4% to 15.4%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in 2024 excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will likely be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion as we continue to make critical investments to support future growth. To summarize, we delivered record sales and strong operating profits in 2023. Cash generation has been and will continue to be a strong focus as we enter 2024, enabling us to continue investing in new products even during times of economic uncertainty, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. As Jen indicated, we do expect moderation in several of our key markets in 2024, especially in the US truck market as reflected in our guidance. We have already taken actions to reduce costs in the business and are in a good situation to navigate the economic cycle and improve our cycle over cycle performance in 2024. Subject to our mark-to-market conditions, our intention is to split the remaining ownership in Atmus through an exchange offer as our next step in the separation as we seek to reposition our portfolio for the future. As part of the proposed exchange offer, common shareholders will have the choice to exchange all, some or none of their shares of Cummins' stock for shares of Atmus common stock subject to the terms of the offer. The exact timing of our decision to launch an exchange offer will, as stated earlier, depend on market conditions, but the launch of the tender could occur as early as in the coming days. Our guidance for Cummins for this year assumes the inclusion of Atmus in our consolidated results for the entirety of 2024 and excludes any costs or benefits of the separation. The benefits to Cummins are expected to include a lower number of shares outstanding upon completion of the exchange. We will update our guidance as and when the separation is completed. Thank you for your interest today. Now let me turn it back over to Chris. Yeah, I would say in the near term, there's a little bit of increased anxiety about events in the Middle East and some shipping delays and some reversing of the trend we've seen in logistics costs, which have been actually going down for us, Jerry. I don't want to overstate that, it's obviously is a little bit of a concern in the near term. Yeah, on the medium duty, Tim, we had a down, down 5% to flat, and that's 140,000 to 150,000. The heavy duty market, we have it down at 10% to 15% and that's our guide for the year. Yeah, good, good question, Tim and the main thing that you didn't cover there was just our assumptions around product coverage. We're not expecting any significant change, but baked into our guidance is a little bit higher product coverage or warranty as a percent of sales in the engine business. We'll see how that plays out, but, that's the other factor that's in there that you didn't list. In a medium duty truck, there really isn't that much difference between the two, and market and hours and then heavy duty, that's where we see a little bit more vulnerability for the market and would largely expect us to move in line with the market. Yeah, I'll have a go -- first go at that question. First of all, I'll just say on aftermarket, we saw a very pronounced, I would say some element of de-stocking or lower production across our lower demand in parts in Q4, which we largely attribute to customer cash flow management. We don't expect that to be a continuing trend. We expect to recover from Q4 levels on parts and be pretty steady across the year. On the truck builds, well, of course, you've heard from most of our major customers. So we really don't have much more to say other than the backlog of trucks has been slowly edging down and then the thing that gives us the broader concern is the spot rates and the health of the truck fleet operators. That's our principal concern. It's not our OEM customers and right now that the backlog and the orders still continue at quite decent levels. It's what's happening to the underlying economics of freight activity. That's what's giving us the concern combined, which hasn't been moving in the right direction, combined with the slowly easing heavy duty backlog. So it isn't a kind of pronounced downturn we might have seen in prior cycles at this point, but those are the factors that are weighing into our consideration and I think our guidance isn't more conservative than anybody else's and we don't have any other observations beyond those really. Probably the clearest secular trend over the next couple of years. Yeah, so morning, Noah. So we're going to start the year with the same stance as last year, invest in the business, dividend focus and some more de-levering. That's the way we start in the year. We'll continue to evaluate that with our board as we see how the cycle unfolds. At least that's our initial stance. Of course, part of our, in years where we've generated more cash than we've needed, then we've returned significantly more than the 50% in any given year, but anyway, we think this is the approach right now until we see a little bit more on the cycle. Yes. The main impacts of Atmus operation will be obviously, they'll set off on their own pursuing their growth strategy and as this final step, we will swap Cummins shares for -- investors will retire Cummins shares in exchange for Atmus shares.

As I reflect back on 2023, I am incredibly proud of what Cummins and our employees accomplished for our stakeholders and I feel energized about the opportunities ahead for us as we continue to demonstrate our relentless focus on being a global leader in clean energy technology and innovation. We made significant progress in achieving our Destination Zero strategy and it continues to be clear that this dual path approach to reducing greenhouse gas and air quality impacts of our products is the right approach to meet our customers' needs today and continue to grow our business and impact. We did this by advancing our core business as well as developing new zero emission solutions through Accelera by Cummins. Most notably, for our core business in 2023, we committed to investing more than $1 billion across our US engine manufacturing network to support the industry's first fuel-agnostic engine and platforms, as well as unveiled the X10 fuel-agnostic series launching in North America in 2026. Additionally, we initiated several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine, which will launch in North America this year and further enables our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. This is the industry's first natural gas engine design specifically for heavy duty and on-highway truck applications, offering customers the opportunity to realize reductions in nitrous oxide and greenhouse gas without compromising performance. We are continuing to see strong interest from both OEMs and end users ahead of the launch later this year. In our Accelera business, we announced a joint venture with Daimler Trucks and Buses, PACCAR, and EVE Energy to accelerate and localize battery self-production and the battery supply chain in the US. We further announced this quarter the selection of Marshall County, Mississippi for the 21-gigawatt-hour factory that is expected to create more than 2,000 US manufacturing jobs with production anticipated to begin in 2027. Accelera also reached a further milestone this year of electrolyzer order backlog, totalling over $500 million. In order to meet the growing electrolyzer demand, we began production at our first US manufacturing location for electrolyzers in the Cummins Power Generation Facility in Fridley, Minnesota. Lastly, we are resolute about the leading role we play in the energy transition, and emissions compliance continues to be a critical element of this work and central to our values. We were transparent about this in December when we announced that we reached an agreement and principle to resolve US regulatory claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process for certain engines, primarily used in our pickup truck applications. After 4.5 years of working diligently with the regulators, reaching an agreement was the best way for us to achieve certainty on this matter and move forward with certifying our new products and advancing our Destination Zero strategy. We have expanded and strengthened our emissions compliance program to help ensure our products comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations around the world. Our product compliance and regulatory affairs organization, which we launched in 2019, has a reporting line directly to me and positions come as to meet global product compliance requirements and deliver solutions for our customers that are safe and lead to a cleaner environment. Now I will comment on overall company performance for the fourth quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for this quarter totalled $8.5 billion, an increase of 10% compared to 2022, driven by strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was a loss of $878 million or negative 10.3% compared to positive $1.1 billion or 14.2% a year ago. Fourth quarter 2023 results included $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve US regulatory claims, $42 million of costs related to a voluntary retirement and separation program, and $33 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. This compares to the fourth quarter 2022 results, which included $19 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.4% of sales compared to $1.1 billion or 14.5%. EBITDA dollars increased from a year ago as increased pricing and higher volumes more than offset increased selling, administrative research and development expenses and inflation costs. Research and development expense increased in the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the engine, components and Accelera segments. In addition, operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 was very strong at $1.5 billion compared to $817 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on working capital management within the business. 2023 revenues were a record $34.1 billion, 21% higher than 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. EBITDA was $3 billion or 8.9% of sales compared to $3.8 billion or 13.5% of sales in 2022. 2023 results include $2.04 billion of costs related to the agreement to resolve US regulatory claims, the voluntary headcount reduction program I noted previously, and $100 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. This compares to our 2022 results, which included $111 million of costs related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia and $81 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA was a record $5.2 billion or 15.3% of sales for 2023 compared to $4 billion or 14.2% of sales for 2022, as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded increased selling, administrative, research and development and inflation costs. EBITDA percent improved year-over-year in the distribution, components and power systems segments. Our Power Systems business in particular finished 2023 with a full year EBITDA of 14.7% of sales, up from 12.2% in 2022. This segment completed the first year of their focused business transformation effort, and the improvement in performance is encouraging. You will see from our guidance that we expect further margin gains this year. In addition to our segments, Meritor finished 2023 with full year EBITDA of 10.8% of sales, up from 7.4% in 2022, as our employees did a tremendous job of executing value capture opportunities across the business. I'm very pleased with the performance of Cummins Meritor to date as we continue our program to improve margins in that business and expand its global reach. In addition, operating cash flow for 2023 was a record of $4 billion, a significant increase from $2 billion in 2022. I'm proud of our leaders and employees efforts in 2023 as they helped deliver on one of our primary focus areas. Strong cash generation will continue to be a top priority moving forward. Now let me provide our overall outlook for 2024 and then comment on individual regions and end markets. Our 2024 guidance continues to include Atmus for the full year, but excludes any costs or benefits associated with the planned separation of that business. We are forecasting total company revenue for 2024 to be down 2% to 5% compared to 2023, and EBITDA to be in the range of 14.4% to 15.4% of sales, as we anticipate slowing demand in some of our key regions and markets, particularly North America heavy duty truck. Early in 2024, we expect the heavy duty market to continue at its current rate, which is slightly off the peak of the first half of 2023, with further softening in our forecast in the second half of the year. Industry production for heavy duty trucks in North America is projected to be 245,000 to 265,000 units in 2024, a 10% to 15% decline year-over-year. In medium duty truck market, we expect market size to be 140,000 units to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat compared to 2023. Our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 units to 145,000 units in 2024, a 5% to 10% decline year-over-year as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024. We're projecting a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy duty and medium duty truck demand, and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% in demand in light duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and moderating export demand. Despite this slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we expect to see continued strong performance for the 15 liter natural gas engine as we achieved approximately 20% share for 2023 in the heavy duty market. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we expect a 5% to 15% decline year over year, primarily driven by weak property investment and shrinking export demand in China. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024. Revenues in the global power generation market are expected to increase 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, while the small market for us, demand for oil and gas engines, is expected to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America. And for aftermarket, we expect a range of flat to an increase of 5% for 2024, as we expect to be largely through inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. In Accelera, we expect full-year sales to be $450 million to $500 million, compared to the $354 million in 2023. We have a growing pipeline of electrolyzer orders, which we expect to deliver over the course of the next 12 months to 18 months, as well as expect continued growth in electrified components. In summary, 2023 was a record year for revenues and operating cash flow, excluding the impacts related to the agreement to resolve U.S. regulatory claims. 2023 was also a record year for EBITDA, net income, and earnings per share. While 2023 revenues were at the high end of our expectations, we anticipate moderating demand in North America truck production in the second half of 2024. We expect this moderating demand to be partially offset by a strong power generation market, resiliency in our distribution business, given the strong aftermarket presence, and improved Accelera sales. In addition, we are taking steps to reduce costs, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. As I close, I would like to officially announce that our Analyst Day is now scheduled for May 16 in New York City. I look forward to further discussing our strategy and expect invitations to be sent out shortly. Now let me turn it over to Mark, who will discuss our financial results in more detail. Mark? Yeah, thanks for that question, Jerry. So as you've seen from us in the past, as we launch product with new emissions regulations, typically we see a content increase, of course, and then also look at creating value for our customers and have an opportunity to price accordingly with them. So we are looking to continue to do that as we launch new products, in particular, these fuel agnostic engine platforms. Of course, we also typically see a bump up in our warranty costs because we are beginning to accrue in at a high rate until we've demonstrated capability of that platform. So that's the other factor to watch as we launch those products, but what you see us doing right now is really focusing on improving operating performance of the business, as well as investing in the key platforms for the future that we believe will bring value to our customers and position the company for profitable growth. And I'll just give a little color. This has been an unusual cycle, I think, in the '21, '22 timeframe and supply constraints that prevented the industry from fully meeting customer demand and that has improved over the course of 2023. We saw the markets peak really in the second quarter and saw some slight drop off in the second half, but to the high end of our guide, it was not as much as we had forecast going into Q1. Backlogs look strong, in particular, feeling quite good about the medium duty market and continuing to watch what happens. We are still predicting a shallow cycle and further softening as we go into the second half of the year. So that, just some color behind those numbers is how I would describe that. Yeah, David, thanks. Thanks for the question. And first, I'll say, I think you said decade long energy transition, I would just put an S on that decades long, right? It's going to take time. The reality is, if you look across our different markets and regions, it's going to take time for that transition to occur. We are in a period, though, of really peak investment in the engine business. As we invest in these fuel agnostic engine platforms, we've got a major investment in R&D and capital to do that. And we think that those engines are going to really position us well with high efficiency diesel products as customers have and continue to decide not to invest in their own platforms and to use Cummins and then also the fuel flexibility that will help customers as they begin to transition, whether its natural gas or hydrogen-based engine solutions. And so the next few years until we launch those platforms in the '26, '27 timeframe, we're seeing higher levels of R&D in those products and then, of course, we're also in a period where we've got somewhat lower revenue and higher investments in the accelerator business and we are pacing that investment based on how we see the market moving. We're looking at opportunities to share investments while having a leading solution, like you saw us do with the battery cell joint venture. As revenues grow, we improve parts of those businesses and electrified components. We've now delivered 1500 buses with Bluebird and ramping up the electrolyzer that will help improve margin performance of the business there. And then the last thing I'd say is, as Cummins has done, and we will continue to do, we're looking at how do we improve different parts of our business and so following the acquisition of the North America distribution business, we had a focused investment on improving margin there and you see that playing out in the distribution business performance and I talked about the focus last year that started in our power systems business. You see that playing out there, the Meritor integration, and we're continuing to look at places that we can improve operating performance of our business and then watch market demands and cost and so the voluntary reduction actions that we took last year help us as we see some reduction in revenue this year. So all those things come together to allow us to continue to improve our returns to investors while making sure we're investing in key products and technologies for the future. Yeah, great. So, obviously, there's some lead that we have in supplying engines into truck build. So our engine build rates will slightly lead truck build rates, but as I said earlier, from a guide perspective, we think where we were running as we ended the year is going to hold pretty steady through the first part of the year and then we're forecasting some softening toward the end of second quarter and into the second half of the year. And then the last dynamic is in pickup, we've got the product changeover that'll drive Q4 volumes lower and pickup. Yeah, so we are in a period of still pretty heavy investment in Accelera businesses are really making both R&D and manufacturing investments to scale up the product and we're fortunate we have, existing plant and data that we can invest within to do that, to begin to produce electrolyzers and we continue to see growing demand and backlog is, as I noted, at a record level for electrolyzers. So that production rate is going to begin to grow and then you'll see margin performance in the electrolyzer portion of the business improving as the revenues grow and we deliver that backlog out into the market. Same thing in our electrified components business as we see revenue growth there. You'll see margin performance improving. One thing we have now included in our 2024 investment, of course, is beginning to invest in the battery cell joint venture and we believe that, that is a key investment that we're making together to ensure we have a leading cell for commercial vehicles here in the U.S. and domestic supply, which will both allow us and our customers to take advantage of incentives that are available and ensure security of supply over time into this market. Yeah, the data center market is an exciting growth market, has been for several years a trend with increasing cloud, data storage in the cloud and now with artificial intelligence and other investments. We continue to see very strong demand. We guided up 10% to 15%. Backlog for that market is very, very strong. We're looking at our capacity to make sure that we can meet the market demand and feeling good about the product offering that we have and of course, that business and the focus on improving underlying performance of that business will help us as that market grows. I don't. Yeah, I think it will continue. Yeah, I will just say we expect that that trend of data center market growth will continue and we are and we'll continue to look at our capacity and how we position to meet that demand. Yeah. There were certainly the OEMs experienced a number of supply chain constraints and continued in '23 and even into the early part of this year, frame rails in particular. So we are, as you as you saw, really expect the medium duty market to continue to hold pretty flat to where it is now. It's quite strong. We, of course, have a strong position in that market and we're seeing continued demand and pent-up demand from some of the customers in that market for our product. So less often in there than heavy duty. Yeah, as you said, we did a kind of a low and a high scenario for adoption at our last Analyst Day and you can expect that we're going to refresh our view of that as we go into the Analyst Day in May. What I would say is that, there are regulations and incentives that are helping to start to drive that adoption, maybe more towards the lower end of those scenarios is what we would think and we are continuing to look at pacing of investment to make sure that we're managing that in line with how we see adoption actually occurring. Yeah, we're still within, it would still fall within the range that we gave in the Analyst Day, consistent with those range of scenarios that we suggested and recall that, a large portion of that revenue in 2030 for Accelera is in the growth of the electrolyzer business as well. Chris and I will answer the rest of the questions."

I'll start with a summary of our third quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details about our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details of our performance, I'm excited to first highlight a few major events from the third quarter that demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy. On September 6th, Accelerate by Cummins, Daimler Truck and Bus and PACCAR, along with EV Energy joined forces to accelerate and localize battery cell production and the battery cell supply chain in the United States. The planned joint venture will manufacture battery cells for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications, creating highly desirable manufacturing jobs in the United States in the growing clean technology sector. Total investment by the partners is expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion for the 21 gigawatt hour factory with production expected to begin in 2027. We see this partnership as an opportunity to share investment with two long-standing partners while advancing a key technology solution for our customers and industry and collectively to accelerate the energy transition in the United States. In October, Cummins completed its acquisition of two Faurecia commercial vehicle manufacturing plants and their related activities, one in Columbus, Indiana and one in Roman Netherlands. This acquisition is a natural addition to the Cummins Emission Solutions business and will help ensure we meet current and future demand for low emission products. Lastly, Cummins announced several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine that further enable our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Freightliner announced they are working with Cummins to offer the new X15 natural gas engine and its heavy-duty Freightliner Cascadia trucks. Also Cummins and Knight Transportation, Inc. announced that the industry's largest full truckload company has successfully tested Cummins new X15 engine in Southern California, using renewable natural gas to realize reductions in nitrous oxides and greenhouse gas without compromising performance. The X15 N, which will launch in North America in 2024 is the first natural gas engine to be designed specifically for the heavy duty on-highway truck application. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international market. Demand for our products continued to be strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the third quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2022 included two months of consolidated operations for Meritor following the completion of the acquisition on August 3rd of 2022. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.6% compared to $884 million or 12.1% a year ago. Third quarter 2023 results include $26 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. This compares to third quarter 2022 results, which included $77 million of costs related to the acquisition, integration and inventory valuation adjustments of Meritor and $16 [ph] million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA percentage of 14.9% in the third quarter of 2023 represented an improvement from 13.3% we delivered in 2022. We as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded increased selling administrative, research and development expenses and inflation costs. Third quarter of 2020 also included a onetime employee recognition bonus of $56 million. Research and development expense increased in the third quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages for us in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components, and Accelera segments. In addition, operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2023 was a record inflow of $1.5 billion compared to the $382 million in the third quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on our working capital management within the business. I'm proud of our leaders and employees for their efforts in driving down costs and operational focus to achieve this record result for the quarter, and we will continue to focus on strong cash generation moving forward. Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 16% to $5.2 billion compared to last year, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand in our core markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 74,000 units, up 1% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, up 18% from last year, reflecting strong demand for our products. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 37,000 units in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 7% from 2022 levels, while our unit sales were 32,000, up 19% from 2022. We shipped 41,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the third quarter of 2023, flat with 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 8%, driven primarily by high inventory in the channel. Revenues in North America Power generation increased 15% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply constraints eased modestly. Our international revenues increased by 13% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago with the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most markets. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, an increase of 24% as markets continue to recover compared to a very weak third quarter of 2022. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 243,000 units, an increase of 48% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 41,000, an increase of 36%. In light-duty markets in China, we saw increase of 14% from 2022 levels at 442,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 26,000, an increase of 12%. Industry demand for excavators in the third quarter was 40,000 units, a decrease of 30% from 2022 levels. The decrease in market size is due to weaker activity in construction. Our units sold were 7,000 units flat with 2022 levels as increased penetration at new and existing customers offset the declining market. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by slight improvement in non-data center markets. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $730 million, an increase of 13% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 17%, while our shipments increased 23%. Power Generation revenues decreased by 16% due to the second quarter -- ahead of emissions regulation changes. Now, let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are raising full year 2023 revenue guidance to be up 18% to 21% versus last year. We are also narrowing our EBITDA guidance range to be 15.2% to 15.4%. We now expect higher full year revenues in our Components segment and higher profitability in our Power Systems segment, offset by decreased profitability in our engine business as a result of softening aftermarket and off-highway markets. We are raising our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 280,000 to 300,000 units in 2023 after a strong third quarter. Our current guidance forecast lower industry truck production in the quarter. While orders remain relatively strong, inventory management, truck component shortages, limiting our OEM production rates and fewer working days are all contributing to our view for the quarter. In North America medium-duty truck market, we're maintaining full year 2023 market size guidance of 135,000 to 150,000 units, up 5% to 15% from 2022. While we continue to work to increase our production through rebalancing across our global plants and improving the supply base, industry production continues to be limited due to other supply chain constraints. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 units in 2023, volume levels in line with 2022. Additionally, we maintain our guidance for North America construction to be down 10% to flat, driven by high channel inventory and softening market conditions. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to increase approximately 15% in 2023, driven by share growth, better volumes and content increase. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and 10% to 20% improvement in light-duty truck market coming off the low market levels in 2022 and that's consistent with the prior guidance. Despite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we are continuing to see strong performance for the 15-liter natural gas engine, which we launched in 2021. Due to the expanding fuel cost differential, approximately 20% of the heavy-duty market is expected to be natural gas power by the end of 2023. In the short time since launching our new natural gas product in China, our share has been ramping up with strong customer reception in the heavy-duty market, and we expect momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. We look forward to launching the 15-liter natural gas engine in North America in 2024. We expect China construction volume to be flat to down 10% in line with prior guidance, consistent with the tepid economy and weaker overall activity. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up approximately 6% in 2023, consistent with our prior forecast. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat to up 10%, consistent with our prior guide. Revenues in the global power generation markets are expected to increase 15% to 20%, consistent with our prior guide, with the strong performance driven primarily by improvement in the data center and mission-critical markets. For Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million and also maintain our EBITDA guidance of the expected loss of $420 million to $440 million for 2023. Within components, Cummins expects revenues contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.5% to 11%. In summary, we are raising our guidance on sales of up 18% to 21% and narrowing our EBITDA guidance range from 15.2% to 15.4%. Our guidance for the full year implies weaker revenue in the fourth quarter. While demand remained strong in several markets, softening in the aftermarket demand, a continued weak outlook in China, continued industry supply constraints impacting North America truck production and inventory management efforts across many markets are some of the factors driving the lower fourth quarter run rate. In view of the lower forecasted revenues, we have initiated actions to reduce costs in our business, particularly in selling and administrative costs. In order to lower costs as we move into next year, we are offering voluntary retirement and a voluntary separation program in select regions and parts of our business for eligible exempt employees. We will continue to monitor our end markets closely and assess the need for further action while continuing to invest for our future. During the quarter, we returned $238 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. Our long-term strategic goal is to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. The strong execution from the second quarter of 2023 continued into the third quarter, driving record operating cash flow despite the ongoing challenges in our operating environment. As we look forward to the opportunities ahead, we have a strong, capable leadership team who will help us successfully navigate an exciting and changing future. Today, I was also pleased to announce several promotions on my leadership team, which will be effective January 1 of next year. First, Srikanth Padmanabhan, currently Vice President and President of the Engine Business, will take on a newly created role of Executive Vice President and President of Operations. In this role, Srikanth will be an important work that will define and drive improvements in how we operate as a company through the energy transition and ensure our success of our operational priorities.

I'm excited for her to leverage her broad experience to run this segment. This is a period of change for our company, and it's also an exciting one. I want to end by thanking our Cummins employees who continue to work tirelessly to meet our customer needs and respond to the strong demand levels by ensuring quality products, strengthening our some relationships and navigating continued supply chain challenges. Our results reflect our focus on delivering strong operating performance, investing in future growth and bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry, while returning cash to shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark.\nMark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenues were $8.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 16% and international revenues grew 13%. Organic sales growth was 10%, driven by improved pricing and strong demand for our On-Highway and power generation products. 5% of the total increase in sales was driven by the addition of Meritor. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.6% of sales for the quarter including $26 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 was $884 million or 12.1% of sales, including $16 million of costs associated with the planned set for [ph] Atmus. And $77 million of our integration and inventory valuation adjustments related to the acquisition of Meritor. Excluding the Atmus separation costs and Meritor adjustments, Underlying EBITDA third quarter was 14.9% compared to 13.3% a year ago. The higher EBITDA percentage was driven by favorable pricing to cover rising input costs and improved logistics costs, partially offset by higher variable compensation associated with the stronger overall company financial performance. In addition, we issued a onetime employee recognition bonus in the third quarter of last year, totaling $56 million. To provide clarity on operational performance in comparison to our guidance and excluding costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and the acquisition integration and inventory valuation stats related to the acquisition of Meritor in my following comments. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of Meritor in August of 2022, resulting in one additional month of operational performance in Q3 this year compared to last year. Now I'll go into more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 24.6% of sales compared to $1.7 billion or 22.9% last year. Gross margin increased by 170 basis points, driven by favorable pricing and logistics costs and the impact of the onetime employee bonus last year, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 14.1% of sales compared to $997 million or 13.6% with the increase primarily driven by both higher variable compensation and higher engineering costs associated with new products across the company. Income from joint ventures was $118 million, $48 million higher than the previous year, driven by the receipt of technology fees and slowly improving demand in China, which boosted the operational results. Other income was a negative $7 million or $20 million lower than a year ago, driven by foreign currency translation. Also included in other income was $28 million of mark-to-market losses on investments. Interest expense increased by $36 million, primarily due to highest higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of our debt. The all-in effective tax rate in the third quarter was 21.4%, including $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter was $656 million or $4.59 per diluted share, including $26 million or $0.14 per diluted share of costs associated with the separation of Atmus. All-in net earnings in the third quarter of last year were $400 million or $2.82 per diluted share, which included $16 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and $77 million of acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Meritor. All-in operating cash flow was a record quarterly inflow of $1.5 billion, $1.1 billion higher than last year, driven by solid earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Generating strong operating cash flow remains a key focus area for the company, and we were pleased with the progress in the third quarter. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes a full year of operations for Meritor and Atmus and excludes any costs of benefit related to the separation of Atmus. Guidance also excludes the impact of any cost reduction activities within Cummins in the fourth quarter. As Jen mentioned, we're raising our revenue guidance for the company to 18% to 21%, up slightly from our previous guidance of 15% to 20%, driven by strong demand in North America. EBITDA is now expected to be 15.2% to 15.4% compared to our previous range of 15% to 15.7%. And we are also narrowing the EBITDA ranges for most of our business segments. Components segment revenue was $3.2 billion, an increase of 20%. EBITDA was 14.2%. Back with the prior year, while EBITDA dollars increased from $384 million to $461 million. Meritor -- Cummins Meritor revenues in the third quarter were $1.2 billion, and EBITDA was $129 million or 11% of sales, a significant improvement from last year and in line with our expectations. For the Components Segment, we now expect total 2023 revenues to increase 35% to 40%, a 3% increase from our previous revenue guidance with EBITDA in the range of 14.2% to 14.7% compared to our previous range of 14.1% to 14.8%. Within Components, Meritor revenues are expected to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, consistent with prior guidance. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.5% to 11% compared to our previous forecast of 10.3% to 11%. Lots of small changes in the individual segment guidance as we get closer to the end of the year. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA 13.5% compared to 13% in 2022 driven by operational improvements and the impact of the one-time employee bonus in the prior year. In 2023, we project revenues for the Engine business will increase 2% to 7% and consistent with our prior projection and EBITDA in the range of 13.6% to 14.1%, a slight decrease from our previous guide of 13.8% to 14.5% due to a continuing softening in our aftermarket revenues and some weaker demand in some off-highway markets. In the Distribution segment, revenues were $2.5 billion, 13% higher than last year. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 12.1% and compared to 10% of sales a year ago, driven by stronger volumes, improved pricing and the impact of the onetime employee bonus last year. We expect distribution revenues to be up 10% to 15%, consistent with prior guidance and narrowing the expected EBITDA range to 11.9% to 12.4%. In the Power Systems business, revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 7%. And EBITDA increased from 14.3% to 16.2%, continuing a trend of last six quarters of improving margins driven by pricing, higher volumes, operational and cost reduction activities have all contributed to the continuing improving performance. In 2023, we expect revenues to be up 8% to 13%, consistent with the prior guidance. And we're raising the expected EBITDA to be in the range of 14.8% to 15.3%, up from our previous projection of 14.3% to 15%. Seller revenues more than doubled to $103 million, driven by electrolyzer project delivery, higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market and the addition of the Siemens Commercial Vehicle business electric powertrain portion of the --. Our EBITDA loss in the segment of $114 million will continue to support strong future growth. Our guidance for the topline and the bottom line [indiscernible] unchanged with revenues in the range of $350 million to $400 million and net losses of $420 million to [Technical Difficulty]. Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Our outlook for capital investments is unchanged and expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to [indiscernible]. We will continue to focus on deploying cash to fund investments that drive profitable growth, debt reduction, and returning cash to shareholders through dividend this year. In summary, we delivered strong sales, solid profitability in the third quarter and record operating cash flow. We'll continue to focus on managing working capital delivering strong margins and investing in the products and technologies that will drive future growth. As we indicated last quarter, we see signs of softening aftermarket demand and weaker demand in some industrial parts. These, combined with less production days in the fourth quarter are expected to contribute to lower revenues and profitability. Have initiated some steps to the costs, as Jennifer outlined, and we'll continue to monitor our end markets closely and assess the need for further actions. Our priorities in 2023 for capital allocation, as I've said, to reinvest for growth, increase the dividend, and reduce debt. In July, we announced a 7% increase in the dividend, our 14th consecutive year of quarterly dividend growth. And through the end of the third quarter, we have reduced debt by $390 million. Furthermore, in October, we reduced debt by a further $650 million, consistent with our plans for the year. Thank you for your interest today. Now, let me turn it back over to Chris.\nChris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning everyone.\nMark Smith: Hey Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Jennifer, congratulations on the joint venture with PACCAR and Daimler. As we look forward to what that means for Cummins product availability and offering within EVs, can we just expand on that in terms of what's the opportunity to bundle it with e-Axles, battery management systems? And if you could just talk about, is there a plan use the plant to source batteries globally for your customers? Or is this strictly focused on the U.S. initially? Just would love your broader comments. Thank you.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So Jerry, I'll add a little bit more color to what we're doing with this partnership. As I said, this partnership is really focused on battery cell manufacturing. So, we have previously been investing and focusing on battery packs, e-Axles, motors, inverters, other key components and integrated powertrains for the electrified powertrain. And together with our partners saw the need to bring production of battery cells into the US and really design what we think is going to be a winning cell solution for commercial vehicles and industrial applications. So, this will be supplied into the battery packs that Cummins will produce. The cell will also go to PACCAR and to Daimler trucks here in North America for their battery cells, really is targeted at the US market. and having a domestic offering that we think will really do the market. And the chemistry here, for this, we will continue to offer battery packs around the world and chemistries, including LSP and NMC. But this one is focused on LFP technology, which, again, together, we think is going to be a winning commercial vehicle battery cell chemistry, lower cost, better durability, less dependency on some of these minerals that can be harder to source and also improve safety. So, really good opportunity for us and also to stay closely connected with those two partners as we're launching these electrified powertrains. Our intent is to offer that battery cell through our packs to other commercial vehicle and industrial applications here in the US as well.\nJerry Revich: Okay. It's super. And Mark, can I ask just a shorter-term question on the Engine segment, you folks had pretty solid performance in the quarter and for the year. The reduced margin rate at the midpoint seems like a big step down in profitability implied fourth quarter versus third quarter. Can you just talk about is that a significant production cut, China JV? Or is that just taking the midpoint of the range versus thinking about the broader, maybe higher end potential outcomes?\nMark Smith: Yes, I think it's not related to China. It is related to the fact that we're going to have less production days. That's consistent with the industry forecast for lower heavy-duty truck, which isn't a surprise, but that's what we've kind of been projecting for a couple of quarters. The thing that's really changed through the course of the year, Jerry, is the decline in the aftermarket, particularly running through the engine business. No doubt, some of that's related to customers rationalizing inventory. I don't, I think the underlying rate of decline is less than the headline rate because we've gone from a period of everybody trying to keep up with demand and now like ourselves, many companies are looking at inventory levels and trying to right-size. But just to give you a sense within the engine business between the first quarter of 2023 in the fourth quarter, parts revenues are down about 18%. So that's kind of been slipping each time we've looked at it. So that's the one changing trend. I don't think it's foretelling do. I just think it's mostly inventory adjustments. But that, combined with the lower production days, the lower absorption means that, yes, even though the revenues are holding up for the fourth quarter, it's going to be a little bit tougher. And that's one of the reasons, not the only reason why we've decided to initiate the actions that we discussed earlier. We're not predicting like a precipitous decline in our revenues at all. We don't have a visible clearly a leveling off or a slight decline in some areas, but we feel it's prudent both to do the cost reduction actions, continue our focus on cash flow and debt reduction the year that should leave us with the best chances of being very successful in 2024.\nChris Clulow: One quick to add, Jerry. It doesn't change our overall guide for engine business, but it is a difference between Q3 and Q4 is our JV income does step down because of license fees timing. So, we had a lot of that happened in the third quarter that steps down about 40 basis points for Engine business margin from Q3 to Q4. So hopefully, that helps.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Raso with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Raso: Thank you. I'm curious, the cost-out decisions. How much is that related to what you're seeing on the horizon in 2024 and if you can give us any insight on what that is? And maybe margins in 2023 being maybe a little more of a, let's say, a heavier lift to expand margins than maybe we see across the machinery space broadly. Just curious how much is it sort of structural to what 2023 is playing out versus what you're seeing in 2024? And obviously, any sense of magnitude the cost outs would be really helpful. Thank you.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, David, I'll start and then Mark can add if he wants to add anything. So, as we said, we see that many of our markets have leveled off. We're seeing some drifting down in some of the markets, aftermarket, off-highway. And we are continuing to focus on ongoing improvement and profitability and performance of our business and using softening markets as a further opportunity to take costs out. So, we still see a lot of strength as we go into next year. We're not going to provide guidance for 2024. Today, what I will say is if you look at backlog and heavy-duty truck and medium-duty truck continues to look quite strong as you go into the first half of the year. Power generation is very strong. And so we're not seeing any precipitous drop off, but we think it's wise to take some cost-cutting actions here in Q4 and then continue to monitor the situation. And if we need to take further action, of course, we would continue to do that.\nMark Smith: And we'll give you a fuller assessment on the next quarterly earnings call about the both the cost and the benefit impact. Of course, what we're announcing today is voluntary actions, so we don't know what the exact take-up is going to be and then our assessment of what is the kind of momentum in markets going forward. There will be some other smaller actions around facilities and other things. But we'll lay that out in detail in the next quarter when we've got a more holistic or hopefully, clearer view of the full year next year.\nDavid Raso: That's helpful. Maybe you can educate me on something. I'm a little confused by the comment in the fourth quarter engine margin. And I appreciate Chris' comment about the JV income, how that will impact 3Q to 4Q, but you highlighted a lower parts impact benefit in the fourth quarter. But then when I see the Components business, which, obviously, has a lot of parts as well, it seems like you're implying a strong fourth quarter on margins for components. So, can you educate me on why the difference one division is getting hit on parts and really the parts division you would think for aftermarket, even more so components, is having a step-up in margins in the fourth quarter, at least appears to be\u2026\nMark Smith: The size of the parts business in the engine business is significantly bigger than the size of the aftermarket business in the Components.\nDavid Raso: Sure. I think difference one step down and one step up. And maybe I'm just doing the math right, but it seems like the component implied fourth quarter margins pretty strong?\nMark Smith: Yeah, I think it's pretty stable. I think that's just the dynamics we're seeing between the two different businesses right now.\nJennifer Rumsey: Well, both of those segments are anticipating lower volumes for North America, medium- and heavy-duty truck market in Q4 for the reasons that I outlined here. Frankly, there's a combination of focus on inventory reduction and supply constraints that are continuing to prevent OEMs from building to the full demand, and we expect to see that in Q4 impact our revenues for both of those segments.\nDavid Raso: All right. Thank you very much.\nMark Smith: There can be some differing customer demand for Components and engines in any given short-term period, David. I think you're right in the longer run or medium over multiple quarters should correlate pretty well. But in this case, we're seeing a bit more pressure on the parts on the engine side. It's not all parts that are sourced directly from our Components business. That's the main part.\nDavid Raso: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Wertheimer: Hey, I have two. One is just on the parts destock that you have mentioned and that makes sense. I'm just curious if you have any sense as to how much channel inventory people carry if you're all the way through that, half the way through. If you just quantify that potential if you're able to?\nMark Smith: It's a little hard to say would say what we tend to see more clearly on the Power Systems side is destocking almost every year into the fourth quarter. We are seeing some of that and some lower rebuilds, particularly in the slice of the oil and gas market that we supply, Rob. But I would say the engine -- on the engine side, the on-highway side, the seems to have been a more sustained multi-quarter approach. And I think part of that there was a focus on prioritizing OEM newbuilds, first-fit build as we started to ramp up through the cycle and wrestle through supply chain. And then the parts was in catch-up mode, and now we're finding truck utilization has leveled off. Everybody is trying to do a better job on the inventory management. It feels like it's -- we're getting towards the bottom of that right now. Of course, that always depends on what's the economic environment and what's the underlying level of truck utilization. So if you were to ask me today, do I think we're on a clear trend to have significantly lower parts in Q1? I'd say no. So it feels like this is the strongest step has been in the last three quarters with the information that we have right.\nRob Wertheimer: Perfect. And then if I can ask kind of a bigger picture question in China. It's obviously been very weak for a lot of industrials. Maybe it's bottomed in all your end markets maybe in some. I wonder if you could just give just your high-level view of what's going on in the economy there, whether fleet dynamics mean you have to be in recovery mode, whether that's true of trucks or power gen? Or just maybe give an overview of China, what you see in different parts of your business on the recovery? Thank you.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah. So when we look at the China market, I mean over economic activity has continued to be pretty weak there. We've seen improvements in 2023 compared to 2022 when they were heavily impacted by COVID lockdowns even more extreme weakness. So you've seen some improvement. We've seen the strong demand for natural gas heavy-duty engines because of the cost delta between natural gas and diesel there. We've kind of come through the emissions change over in an on-highway market. And so if we see recovery and continued recovery in the economy there, so I think that will continue to positively impact our business. And with the product investments that we've made, the emissions change, we'll have more content, and we think continuing to increase our penetration. So we'll watch and see if any of the government stimulus does start to drive positive momentum and the economic activity, but it's been relatively weak this year.\nMark Smith: Yeah. I mean just to give you a sense, I know we don't like talking about months, but July was like the lowest in a decade, right, in some of our JV production. It's crept up since there, but it has been tough. Again, it's not worse than we thought, but that just gives you a sense of how weak it was in the summer. Hopefully, there's upside from here, but we don't have good visibility to that.\nChris Clulow: Yeah, the RMB1 billion bond that's planned, I think that's encouraging to see the government moving that won't impact fourth quarter, but hopefully, it drives more infrastructure growth in next year. We'll wait and see that we're up.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. So I just wanted to ask about the Power Systems business. Margins came out really strong. Sales growth is strong as well. But when we look at the fourth quarter guide, it seems like you're guiding to a step down of almost 200 basis points sequentially. So just wanted to get a sense of what's driving that? Is this conservatism? Or is there something that we need to be aware of for the fourth quarter for the segment?\nMark Smith: Right. So the good news is they've been performing really well. So that's the underlying, and I think that's -- we expect that to be a continuing trend. As I mentioned earlier, typically, we see, particularly with the industrial side of that business that the customers really dropped down the purchase of parts in the fourth quarter. That's not new, but that that typically happens every Q4, and that's probably the main factor there -- the main negative factor. Otherwise, the underlying demand is strong. There's no major changes to pricing or the cost structure.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. That's very helpful. And the next question is R&D spend. The R&D spend over the last five years have stepped up notably. How should we think about that spend, let's say, in the next couple of years, and any color on that?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, Tami, as you noted in a period of increased R&D investment that we think will position Cummins well for the future. So in particular, now through the 2026, 2027 time frame when we launch these new fuel-agnostic engine platforms, we're making a major R&D and capital investments, and those are bringing new customer business to us and also will position us to have leading products through the energy transition. We've also been increasing our investment in the Accelera business as we ramp up the product investments for our electrolyzers and see growing demand for electrolyzer volume as well as in the electrified components. So that's really what you're seeing come through in the R&D line. And then we're continuing to really focus on improving underlying performance and efficiency in other areas so that we can continue to make the necessary R&D investments.\nA \u2013 Mark Smith : Yes. And that's why we've had a big push on the SG&A and continue to do that. So well, on gross margin. So we can grow margins, grow investment, grow the bottom line and keep improving the cash. That's a simple formula that we're working to. We'd like to see the cash flow come up. The engineering is going to remain these higher levels for a little while yet. And it's also the new engine business platforms are contributing to the -- yes, CapEx being higher in dollar terms. It's in our expected range as a percent of sales. But for the next couple of years, we've got these renewal of these major platforms, which is important for our future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Thein with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Thein: Thanks. Good morning. The first question is on Power Systems. And I'm just curious about kind of the visibility that you have looking into 2024. And backlog isn't something that we historically really talked about with Cummins, but just given the long lead times for large engines and just visibility you have from a rebuild perspective, can you just maybe speak to where you think you exit the year in terms of -- again, I know you're not giving 2024 guidance, but just any sort of help you can give in terms of what kind of revenue visibility you would expect to exit the year with in that business?\nA \u2013 Mark Smith: Yes, you're right, Tim, that there is more visibility, but long lead times and the underlying demand. Certainly, I think we've got great visibility through the first half of the year. And of course, we're seeing -- we're anticipating more pressure on the on-highway side just because not a severe downturn, but generally, market participants are expecting some moderation in heavy-duty truck orders going into next year. So we would expect more revenue headwinds on the engines and components side. Distribution, as you know, is very heavily aftermarket-driven. So absent some massive crush in the economy, that should be more stable. And then Power Systems, certainly, very strong visibility through the first half of the year and some into the second half of the year. We haven't seen a dramatic shift in trajectory at this point in time.\nJennifer Rumsey : Yes. I mean we're continuing to, as Mark said, to watch the Power Systems markets and in the industrial markets, we have seen a little bit of softening in oil and gas, which is a relatively small market for us that's kind of its inverse. And so that has softened a little bit. And then in Power Gen, you see a lot of growth this year. And I expect continued strong demand in the data center market for our business, and we're well positioned there.\nA \u2013 Mark Smith: And it's encouraging that both Power Systems and distribution now are on multi-period margin expansion trends that serve us well going forward.\nTim Thein: Yes. Okay. And then just a lot of discussion here in terms of the on-highway parts business for you. And again, I know it's probably a bit of apples and oranges, but just listening to the commentary from your largest customer and kind of the outlook there they have for their own parts business. What do you think -- again, I know you don't want to speak for them, but what do you think is the -- you mentioned down 18%, I think from the beginning of the year. I think they're down like 2% or 3%. What do you think is driving that invariability between you come in to experience versus at least some of the OEMs? And yes, I know that the businesses don't align perfectly, but presumably, their impacted by a lot of the same dynamics. Just curious how beyond that.\nA \u2013 Mark Smith: Generally, I think it's destocking, right? We've had -- we have -- there's obviously, we know returns levels and things like that from all parts of our channel have gone up as customers have been deep.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. I think it's really important to note through this cycle, two very different dynamics because of the supply constraints than what you would previously see. So the aftermarket demand was really strong. And with the supply constraints, it was challenging for some of our customers to get parts. And so there was a lot of focus on building up inventory to try to buffer against those constraints and a focus, frankly, on addressing the gaps that resulted in an overbuild of inventory. So now that some of those supply challenges have eased this getting inventory back to appropriate levels has been a focus, and that's driven a drop-off beyond just the actual aftermarket demand in service. And then the same is true and happening on the first-fit build that we've had supply constraints that have limited our ability to meet industry demand and you see that resulting in the markets holding up longer than you would typically see and continue to see solid demand for first-fit trucks.\nA \u2013 Mark Smith: And then if I just step back from the noise in this kind of correction period, Tim, clearly, our market share in North America on-highway markets has gone up noticeably so that should all go well for the parts that will inevitably be purchased through Cummins. I just think just in this correction period. I was just trying to provide that extra color this time to explain what I think a short-term margin influences, but not long-term market trends.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. Just curious about how much visibility you have to on-highway engine pricing going forward at this point into 2024. I guess to what extent is your pricing going to be dependent on the pricing of your OEM customers or how independent can that be?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, we were price cost favorable this year, as we've shared previously, and we have -- we're continuing to focus on pricing with new product launches and where we've seen inflationary costs coming through. So we're working to continue to maintain that positive price/cost ratio. And we're seeing some slowing of course, in pricing in the market, but we'll expect to continue to have some of that.\nA \u2013 Mark Smith: Right. And again, when we give out for next year, then we'll, I'm sure you'll ask us about price cost. We'll be happy to share the dynamic.\nSteven Fisher: Sure. Yes. Thank you. And then can you expand a little bit on your comments on the construction outlook? I think you cited inventory adjustments in North America, but maybe you can just talk about the broader global view of engine demand for construction applications and how you think the setup there is for 2024. Is there sort of a demand question or is it just sort of near-term inventory management?\nA \u2013 Mark Smith: I think part of it can be the age of construction fleets, right? So we're seeing a drop off in engine demand. That doesn't necessarily mean a dramatic shift in North America construction activity. The three biggest markets both in North America, China and Europe, I think generally, it feels like the pace of economic growth in Europe is slowing. In China, it surprised us a little bit that the construction equipment demand hasn't fallen even further given some of the trails in the overall kind of financial health of construction sector in China, but it has come down some. But yes, no clear picture yet going into next year, I would say, that of all the markets, we still got some tire kick in to do, Steve, to figure out where we land for next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will be from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nNoah Kaye: Yeah. Thanks. You indicated some favorable testing around the X15 and coming to market next year. So just would love to get a little bit more color on your expectations for demand there, the extent to which this could be a driver of share gains and where you're hearing the sort of the strongest indicators of demand for that product?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah. So we'll launch the X15 here in North America next as you heard me say, it's performing well in China. We'll have a US version of that, of course, meeting the regulatory requirements here next year, and we'll have availability now through two of our OEMs. And we are seeing end customers testing and interested in that product will have the only heavy-duty natural gas product offered here in North America. So of course, that creates some opportunity for us as customers where they've got infrastructure, environmental goals or even operating cost benefits associated with natural gas will start to adopt that solution more. So there's some opportunity there for sure.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. And then I think we'd love to get a catch-up on the electrolyzer backlog and quoting activity. Any change in the trajectory there? Anything you noticed during the quarter? And can you update us on where you're at in terms of building out capacity?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah. Really, on the same trajectory we've talked about previously with building up manufacturing capacity here in the US and Europe, continuing to have backlog growing. We are in the process of commissioning a 25-megawatt electrolyzer with Florida Power and Light over the course of this year. So another big project that we're delivering this year, and we continue to ramp up that business as we described previously.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Chris Clulow for any closing remarks.\nChris Clulow: Thank you very much for your interest today. And as always, the Investor Relations team will be available for calls and answer any further questions that you may have. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Mark Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter revenues were $8.4 billion, up 15% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 16% and international revenues grew 13%. Organic sales growth was 10%, driven by improved pricing and strong demand for our On-Highway and power generation products. 5% of the total increase in sales was driven by the addition of Meritor. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.6% of sales for the quarter including $26 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. EBITDA in the third quarter of 2022 was $884 million or 12.1% of sales, including $16 million of costs associated with the planned set for [ph] Atmus. And $77 million of our integration and inventory valuation adjustments related to the acquisition of Meritor. Excluding the Atmus separation costs and Meritor adjustments, Underlying EBITDA third quarter was 14.9% compared to 13.3% a year ago. The higher EBITDA percentage was driven by favorable pricing to cover rising input costs and improved logistics costs, partially offset by higher variable compensation associated with the stronger overall company financial performance. In addition, we issued a onetime employee recognition bonus in the third quarter of last year, totaling $56 million. To provide clarity on operational performance in comparison to our guidance and excluding costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and the acquisition integration and inventory valuation stats related to the acquisition of Meritor in my following comments. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of Meritor in August of 2022, resulting in one additional month of operational performance in Q3 this year compared to last year. Now I'll go into more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 24.6% of sales compared to $1.7 billion or 22.9% last year. Gross margin increased by 170 basis points, driven by favorable pricing and logistics costs and the impact of the onetime employee bonus last year, partially offset by higher variable compensation expenses. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 14.1% of sales compared to $997 million or 13.6% with the increase primarily driven by both higher variable compensation and higher engineering costs associated with new products across the company. Income from joint ventures was $118 million, $48 million higher than the previous year, driven by the receipt of technology fees and slowly improving demand in China, which boosted the operational results. Other income was a negative $7 million or $20 million lower than a year ago, driven by foreign currency translation. Also included in other income was $28 million of mark-to-market losses on investments. Interest expense increased by $36 million, primarily due to highest higher interest rates on the floating rate portion of our debt. The all-in effective tax rate in the third quarter was 21.4%, including $5 million or $0.03 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter was $656 million or $4.59 per diluted share, including $26 million or $0.14 per diluted share of costs associated with the separation of Atmus. All-in net earnings in the third quarter of last year were $400 million or $2.82 per diluted share, which included $16 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and $77 million of acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Meritor. All-in operating cash flow was a record quarterly inflow of $1.5 billion, $1.1 billion higher than last year, driven by solid earnings and continued focus on working capital management. Generating strong operating cash flow remains a key focus area for the company, and we were pleased with the progress in the third quarter. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes a full year of operations for Meritor and Atmus and excludes any costs of benefit related to the separation of Atmus. Guidance also excludes the impact of any cost reduction activities within Cummins in the fourth quarter. As Jen mentioned, we're raising our revenue guidance for the company to 18% to 21%, up slightly from our previous guidance of 15% to 20%, driven by strong demand in North America. EBITDA is now expected to be 15.2% to 15.4% compared to our previous range of 15% to 15.7%. And we are also narrowing the EBITDA ranges for most of our business segments. Components segment revenue was $3.2 billion, an increase of 20%. EBITDA was 14.2%. Back with the prior year, while EBITDA dollars increased from $384 million to $461 million. Meritor -- Cummins Meritor revenues in the third quarter were $1.2 billion, and EBITDA was $129 million or 11% of sales, a significant improvement from last year and in line with our expectations. For the Components Segment, we now expect total 2023 revenues to increase 35% to 40%, a 3% increase from our previous revenue guidance with EBITDA in the range of 14.2% to 14.7% compared to our previous range of 14.1% to 14.8%. Within Components, Meritor revenues are expected to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, consistent with prior guidance. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.5% to 11% compared to our previous forecast of 10.3% to 11%. Lots of small changes in the individual segment guidance as we get closer to the end of the year. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA 13.5% compared to 13% in 2022 driven by operational improvements and the impact of the one-time employee bonus in the prior year. In 2023, we project revenues for the Engine business will increase 2% to 7% and consistent with our prior projection and EBITDA in the range of 13.6% to 14.1%, a slight decrease from our previous guide of 13.8% to 14.5% due to a continuing softening in our aftermarket revenues and some weaker demand in some off-highway markets. In the Distribution segment, revenues were $2.5 billion, 13% higher than last year. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 12.1% and compared to 10% of sales a year ago, driven by stronger volumes, improved pricing and the impact of the onetime employee bonus last year. We expect distribution revenues to be up 10% to 15%, consistent with prior guidance and narrowing the expected EBITDA range to 11.9% to 12.4%. In the Power Systems business, revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 7%. And EBITDA increased from 14.3% to 16.2%, continuing a trend of last six quarters of improving margins driven by pricing, higher volumes, operational and cost reduction activities have all contributed to the continuing improving performance. In 2023, we expect revenues to be up 8% to 13%, consistent with the prior guidance. And we're raising the expected EBITDA to be in the range of 14.8% to 15.3%, up from our previous projection of 14.3% to 15%. Seller revenues more than doubled to $103 million, driven by electrolyzer project delivery, higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market and the addition of the Siemens Commercial Vehicle business electric powertrain portion of the --. Our EBITDA loss in the segment of $114 million will continue to support strong future growth. Our guidance for the topline and the bottom line [indiscernible] unchanged with revenues in the range of $350 million to $400 million and net losses of $420 million to [Technical Difficulty]. Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Our outlook for capital investments is unchanged and expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to [indiscernible]. We will continue to focus on deploying cash to fund investments that drive profitable growth, debt reduction, and returning cash to shareholders through dividend this year. In summary, we delivered strong sales, solid profitability in the third quarter and record operating cash flow. We'll continue to focus on managing working capital delivering strong margins and investing in the products and technologies that will drive future growth. As we indicated last quarter, we see signs of softening aftermarket demand and weaker demand in some industrial parts. These, combined with less production days in the fourth quarter are expected to contribute to lower revenues and profitability. Have initiated some steps to the costs, as Jennifer outlined, and we'll continue to monitor our end markets closely and assess the need for further actions. Our priorities in 2023 for capital allocation, as I've said, to reinvest for growth, increase the dividend, and reduce debt. In July, we announced a 7% increase in the dividend, our 14th consecutive year of quarterly dividend growth. And through the end of the third quarter, we have reduced debt by $390 million. Furthermore, in October, we reduced debt by a further $650 million, consistent with our plans for the year. Thank you for your interest today. Now, let me turn it back over to Chris. Hey Jerry. Yes, I think it's not related to China. It is related to the fact that we're going to have less production days. That's consistent with the industry forecast for lower heavy-duty truck, which isn't a surprise, but that's what we've kind of been projecting for a couple of quarters. The thing that's really changed through the course of the year, Jerry, is the decline in the aftermarket, particularly running through the engine business. No doubt, some of that's related to customers rationalizing inventory. I don't, I think the underlying rate of decline is less than the headline rate because we've gone from a period of everybody trying to keep up with demand and now like ourselves, many companies are looking at inventory levels and trying to right-size. But just to give you a sense within the engine business between the first quarter of 2023 in the fourth quarter, parts revenues are down about 18%. So that's kind of been slipping each time we've looked at it. So that's the one changing trend. I don't think it's foretelling do. I just think it's mostly inventory adjustments. But that, combined with the lower production days, the lower absorption means that, yes, even though the revenues are holding up for the fourth quarter, it's going to be a little bit tougher. And that's one of the reasons, not the only reason why we've decided to initiate the actions that we discussed earlier. We're not predicting like a precipitous decline in our revenues at all. We don't have a visible clearly a leveling off or a slight decline in some areas, but we feel it's prudent both to do the cost reduction actions, continue our focus on cash flow and debt reduction the year that should leave us with the best chances of being very successful in 2024. And we'll give you a fuller assessment on the next quarterly earnings call about the both the cost and the benefit impact. Of course, what we're announcing today is voluntary actions, so we don't know what the exact take-up is going to be and then our assessment of what is the kind of momentum in markets going forward. There will be some other smaller actions around facilities and other things. But we'll lay that out in detail in the next quarter when we've got a more holistic or hopefully, clearer view of the full year next year. The size of the parts business in the engine business is significantly bigger than the size of the aftermarket business in the Components. Yeah, I think it's pretty stable. I think that's just the dynamics we're seeing between the two different businesses right now. There can be some differing customer demand for Components and engines in any given short-term period, David. I think you're right in the longer run or medium over multiple quarters should correlate pretty well. But in this case, we're seeing a bit more pressure on the parts on the engine side. It's not all parts that are sourced directly from our Components business. That's the main part. It's a little hard to say would say what we tend to see more clearly on the Power Systems side is destocking almost every year into the fourth quarter. We are seeing some of that and some lower rebuilds, particularly in the slice of the oil and gas market that we supply, Rob. But I would say the engine -- on the engine side, the on-highway side, the seems to have been a more sustained multi-quarter approach. And I think part of that there was a focus on prioritizing OEM newbuilds, first-fit build as we started to ramp up through the cycle and wrestle through supply chain. And then the parts was in catch-up mode, and now we're finding truck utilization has leveled off. Everybody is trying to do a better job on the inventory management. It feels like it's -- we're getting towards the bottom of that right now. Of course, that always depends on what's the economic environment and what's the underlying level of truck utilization. So if you were to ask me today, do I think we're on a clear trend to have significantly lower parts in Q1? I'd say no. So it feels like this is the strongest step has been in the last three quarters with the information that we have right. Yeah. I mean just to give you a sense, I know we don't like talking about months, but July was like the lowest in a decade, right, in some of our JV production. It's crept up since there, but it has been tough. Again, it's not worse than we thought, but that just gives you a sense of how weak it was in the summer. Hopefully, there's upside from here, but we don't have good visibility to that. Right. So the good news is they've been performing really well. So that's the underlying, and I think that's -- we expect that to be a continuing trend. As I mentioned earlier, typically, we see, particularly with the industrial side of that business that the customers really dropped down the purchase of parts in the fourth quarter. That's not new, but that that typically happens every Q4, and that's probably the main factor there -- the main negative factor. Otherwise, the underlying demand is strong. There's no major changes to pricing or the cost structure."

            "name": "Jennifer Rumsey",
            "content": "Thank you Chris and good morning everyone. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details about our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details of our performance, I'm excited to first highlight a few major events from the third quarter that demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy. On September 6th, Accelerate by Cummins, Daimler Truck and Bus and PACCAR, along with EV Energy joined forces to accelerate and localize battery cell production and the battery cell supply chain in the United States. The planned joint venture will manufacture battery cells for electric commercial vehicles and industrial applications, creating highly desirable manufacturing jobs in the United States in the growing clean technology sector. Total investment by the partners is expected to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion for the 21 gigawatt hour factory with production expected to begin in 2027. We see this partnership as an opportunity to share investment with two long-standing partners while advancing a key technology solution for our customers and industry and collectively to accelerate the energy transition in the United States. In October, Cummins completed its acquisition of two Faurecia commercial vehicle manufacturing plants and their related activities, one in Columbus, Indiana and one in Roman Netherlands. This acquisition is a natural addition to the Cummins Emission Solutions business and will help ensure we meet current and future demand for low emission products. Lastly, Cummins announced several collaborations with our natural gas X15 engine that further enable our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. Freightliner announced they are working with Cummins to offer the new X15 natural gas engine and its heavy-duty Freightliner Cascadia trucks. Also Cummins and Knight Transportation, Inc. announced that the industry's largest full truckload company has successfully tested Cummins new X15 engine in Southern California, using renewable natural gas to realize reductions in nitrous oxides and greenhouse gas without compromising performance. The X15 N, which will launch in North America in 2024 is the first natural gas engine to be designed specifically for the heavy duty on-highway truck application. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international market. Demand for our products continued to be strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for the quarter were $8.4 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the third quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most global markets. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2022 included two months of consolidated operations for Meritor following the completion of the acquisition on August 3rd of 2022. EBITDA was $1.2 billion or 14.6% compared to $884 million or 12.1% a year ago. Third quarter 2023 results include $26 million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. This compares to third quarter 2022 results, which included $77 million of costs related to the acquisition, integration and inventory valuation adjustments of Meritor and $16 [ph] million of costs related to the separation of the filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA percentage of 14.9% in the third quarter of 2023 represented an improvement from 13.3% we delivered in 2022. We as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded increased selling administrative, research and development expenses and inflation costs. Third quarter of 2020 also included a onetime employee recognition bonus of $56 million. Research and development expense increased in the third quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages for us in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components, and Accelera segments. In addition, operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2023 was a record inflow of $1.5 billion compared to the $382 million in the third quarter of 2022 as we continue to focus on our working capital management within the business. I'm proud of our leaders and employees for their efforts in driving down costs and operational focus to achieve this record result for the quarter, and we will continue to focus on strong cash generation moving forward. Our third quarter revenues in North America grew 16% to $5.2 billion compared to last year, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand in our core markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 74,000 units, up 1% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, up 18% from last year, reflecting strong demand for our products. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 37,000 units in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 7% from 2022 levels, while our unit sales were 32,000, up 19% from 2022. We shipped 41,000 engines to Stellantis for use in their Ram pickups in the third quarter of 2023, flat with 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 8%, driven primarily by high inventory in the channel. Revenues in North America Power generation increased 15% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply constraints eased modestly. Our international revenues increased by 13% in the third quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago with the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most markets. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, an increase of 24% as markets continue to recover compared to a very weak third quarter of 2022. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 243,000 units, an increase of 48% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 41,000, an increase of 36%. In light-duty markets in China, we saw increase of 14% from 2022 levels at 442,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 26,000, an increase of 12%. Industry demand for excavators in the third quarter was 40,000 units, a decrease of 30% from 2022 levels. The decrease in market size is due to weaker activity in construction. Our units sold were 7,000 units flat with 2022 levels as increased penetration at new and existing customers offset the declining market. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 5% in the third quarter, primarily driven by slight improvement in non-data center markets. Third quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $730 million, an increase of 13% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 17%, while our shipments increased 23%. Power Generation revenues decreased by 16% due to the second quarter -- ahead of emissions regulation changes. Now, let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are raising full year 2023 revenue guidance to be up 18% to 21% versus last year. We are also narrowing our EBITDA guidance range to be 15.2% to 15.4%. We now expect higher full year revenues in our Components segment and higher profitability in our Power Systems segment, offset by decreased profitability in our engine business as a result of softening aftermarket and off-highway markets. We are raising our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 280,000 to 300,000 units in 2023 after a strong third quarter. Our current guidance forecast lower industry truck production in the quarter. While orders remain relatively strong, inventory management, truck component shortages, limiting our OEM production rates and fewer working days are all contributing to our view for the quarter. In North America medium-duty truck market, we're maintaining full year 2023 market size guidance of 135,000 to 150,000 units, up 5% to 15% from 2022. While we continue to work to increase our production through rebalancing across our global plants and improving the supply base, industry production continues to be limited due to other supply chain constraints. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 units in 2023, volume levels in line with 2022. Additionally, we maintain our guidance for North America construction to be down 10% to flat, driven by high channel inventory and softening market conditions. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to increase approximately 15% in 2023, driven by share growth, better volumes and content increase. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and 10% to 20% improvement in light-duty truck market coming off the low market levels in 2022 and that's consistent with the prior guidance. Despite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we are continuing to see strong performance for the 15-liter natural gas engine, which we launched in 2021. Due to the expanding fuel cost differential, approximately 20% of the heavy-duty market is expected to be natural gas power by the end of 2023. In the short time since launching our new natural gas product in China, our share has been ramping up with strong customer reception in the heavy-duty market, and we expect momentum to continue into the fourth quarter. We look forward to launching the 15-liter natural gas engine in North America in 2024. We expect China construction volume to be flat to down 10% in line with prior guidance, consistent with the tepid economy and weaker overall activity. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up approximately 6% in 2023, consistent with our prior forecast. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat to up 10%, consistent with our prior guide. Revenues in the global power generation markets are expected to increase 15% to 20%, consistent with our prior guide, with the strong performance driven primarily by improvement in the data center and mission-critical markets. For Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million and also maintain our EBITDA guidance of the expected loss of $420 million to $440 million for 2023. Within components, Cummins expects revenues contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.5% to 11%. In summary, we are raising our guidance on sales of up 18% to 21% and narrowing our EBITDA guidance range from 15.2% to 15.4%. Our guidance for the full year implies weaker revenue in the fourth quarter. While demand remained strong in several markets, softening in the aftermarket demand, a continued weak outlook in China, continued industry supply constraints impacting North America truck production and inventory management efforts across many markets are some of the factors driving the lower fourth quarter run rate. In view of the lower forecasted revenues, we have initiated actions to reduce costs in our business, particularly in selling and administrative costs. In order to lower costs as we move into next year, we are offering voluntary retirement and a voluntary separation program in select regions and parts of our business for eligible exempt employees. We will continue to monitor our end markets closely and assess the need for further action while continuing to invest for our future. During the quarter, we returned $238 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. Our long-term strategic goal is to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. The strong execution from the second quarter of 2023 continued into the third quarter, driving record operating cash flow despite the ongoing challenges in our operating environment. As we look forward to the opportunities ahead, we have a strong, capable leadership team who will help us successfully navigate an exciting and changing future. Today, I was also pleased to announce several promotions on my leadership team, which will be effective January 1 of next year. First, Srikanth Padmanabhan, currently Vice President and President of the Engine Business, will take on a newly created role of Executive Vice President and President of Operations. In this role, Srikanth will be an important work that will define and drive improvements in how we operate as a company through the energy transition and ensure our success of our operational priorities. Throughout his more than 30 years at Cummins, Srikanth has worked across many of Cummins businesses and regions, and consistently pushed the boundaries of customer-focused innovation to position Cummins as the leading powertrain supplier of choice in the transition to a net zero future. Srikanth is a result and people-driven leader and is the perfect choice to lead this work. Second, Brett Merritt, currently Vice President of On-Highway Engine Business and Strategic Customer Relations will assume the role of Vice President and President of the Engine Business, replacing Srikanth when he takes his new role. Brett has spent more than 25 years in the automotive and commercial vehicle industry and more than 14 at Cummins. The past 11 spent leading and growing On-Highway Business from 800,000 engines in 2012 to 1.2 million engines last year. Brett is an experienced business leader and a trusted partner to many of our key customers, and I'm excited for Brett to lead this segment. Bonnie Fetch, currently Vice President of Global Supply Chain, will assume the role of Vice President and President of our Distribution Business, replacing Tony Satterthwaite., who has been acting as Interim Head of DBU. Bonnie, who previously led supply chain for DBU has led for Cummins global supply chain and manufacturing organization, including Cummins new and ReCon parts business since early 2022, where she led her team in navigating the many complex supply chain challenges as well as improved operational and functional performance. For more than 30 years of experience, including 20 years at Caterpillar, before coming to Cummins, includes General Management, HR and Supply Chain Leadership and makes her uniquely qualified for this role. I'm excited for her to leverage her broad experience to run this segment. This is a period of change for our company, and it's also an exciting one. I want to end by thanking our Cummins employees who continue to work tirelessly to meet our customer needs and respond to the strong demand levels by ensuring quality products, strengthening our some relationships and navigating continued supply chain challenges. Our results reflect our focus on delivering strong operating performance, investing in future growth and bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry, while returning cash to shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Yes. So Jerry, I'll add a little bit more color to what we're doing with this partnership. As I said, this partnership is really focused on battery cell manufacturing. So, we have previously been investing and focusing on battery packs, e-Axles, motors, inverters, other key components and integrated powertrains for the electrified powertrain. And together with our partners saw the need to bring production of battery cells into the US and really design what we think is going to be a winning cell solution for commercial vehicles and industrial applications. So, this will be supplied into the battery packs that Cummins will produce. The cell will also go to PACCAR and to Daimler trucks here in North America for their battery cells, really is targeted at the US market. and having a domestic offering that we think will really do the market. And the chemistry here, for this, we will continue to offer battery packs around the world and chemistries, including LSP and NMC. But this one is focused on LFP technology, which, again, together, we think is going to be a winning commercial vehicle battery cell chemistry, lower cost, better durability, less dependency on some of these minerals that can be harder to source and also improve safety. So, really good opportunity for us and also to stay closely connected with those two partners as we're launching these electrified powertrains. Our intent is to offer that battery cell through our packs to other commercial vehicle and industrial applications here in the US as well. Yes, David, I'll start and then Mark can add if he wants to add anything. So, as we said, we see that many of our markets have leveled off. We're seeing some drifting down in some of the markets, aftermarket, off-highway. And we are continuing to focus on ongoing improvement and profitability and performance of our business and using softening markets as a further opportunity to take costs out. So, we still see a lot of strength as we go into next year. We're not going to provide guidance for 2024. Today, what I will say is if you look at backlog and heavy-duty truck and medium-duty truck continues to look quite strong as you go into the first half of the year. Power generation is very strong. And so we're not seeing any precipitous drop off, but we think it's wise to take some cost-cutting actions here in Q4 and then continue to monitor the situation. And if we need to take further action, of course, we would continue to do that. Well, both of those segments are anticipating lower volumes for North America, medium- and heavy-duty truck market in Q4 for the reasons that I outlined here. Frankly, there's a combination of focus on inventory reduction and supply constraints that are continuing to prevent OEMs from building to the full demand, and we expect to see that in Q4 impact our revenues for both of those segments. Yeah. So when we look at the China market, I mean over economic activity has continued to be pretty weak there. We've seen improvements in 2023 compared to 2022 when they were heavily impacted by COVID lockdowns even more extreme weakness. So you've seen some improvement. We've seen the strong demand for natural gas heavy-duty engines because of the cost delta between natural gas and diesel there. We've kind of come through the emissions change over in an on-highway market. And so if we see recovery and continued recovery in the economy there, so I think that will continue to positively impact our business. And with the product investments that we've made, the emissions change, we'll have more content, and we think continuing to increase our penetration. So we'll watch and see if any of the government stimulus does start to drive positive momentum and the economic activity, but it's been relatively weak this year. Yes, Tami, as you noted in a period of increased R&D investment that we think will position Cummins well for the future. So in particular, now through the 2026, 2027 time frame when we launch these new fuel-agnostic engine platforms, we're making a major R&D and capital investments, and those are bringing new customer business to us and also will position us to have leading products through the energy transition. We've also been increasing our investment in the Accelera business as we ramp up the product investments for our electrolyzers and see growing demand for electrolyzer volume as well as in the electrified components. So that's really what you're seeing come through in the R&D line. And then we're continuing to really focus on improving underlying performance and efficiency in other areas so that we can continue to make the necessary R&D investments.\nA \u2013 Mark Smith:Yes. And that's why we've had a big push on the SG&A and continue to do that. So well, on gross margin. So we can grow margins, grow investment, grow the bottom line and keep improving the cash. That's a simple formula that we're working to. We'd like to see the cash flow come up. The engineering is going to remain these higher levels for a little while yet. And it's also the new engine business platforms are contributing to the -- yes, CapEx being higher in dollar terms. It's in our expected range as a percent of sales. But for the next couple of years, we've got these renewal of these major platforms, which is important for our future. Yes. I mean we're continuing to, as Mark said, to watch the Power Systems markets and in the industrial markets, we have seen a little bit of softening in oil and gas, which is a relatively small market for us that's kind of its inverse. And so that has softened a little bit. And then in Power Gen, you see a lot of growth this year. And I expect continued strong demand in the data center market for our business, and we're well positioned there.\nA \u2013 Mark Smith: And it's encouraging that both Power Systems and distribution now are on multi-period margin expansion trends that serve us well going forward. Yes. I think it's really important to note through this cycle, two very different dynamics because of the supply constraints than what you would previously see. So the aftermarket demand was really strong. And with the supply constraints, it was challenging for some of our customers to get parts. And so there was a lot of focus on building up inventory to try to buffer against those constraints and a focus, frankly, on addressing the gaps that resulted in an overbuild of inventory. So now that some of those supply challenges have eased this getting inventory back to appropriate levels has been a focus, and that's driven a drop-off beyond just the actual aftermarket demand in service. And then the same is true and happening on the first-fit build that we've had supply constraints that have limited our ability to meet industry demand and you see that resulting in the markets holding up longer than you would typically see and continue to see solid demand for first-fit trucks.\nA \u2013 Mark Smith: And then if I just step back from the noise in this kind of correction period, Tim, clearly, our market share in North America on-highway markets has gone up noticeably so that should all go well for the parts that will inevitably be purchased through Cummins. I just think just in this correction period. I was just trying to provide that extra color this time to explain what I think a short-term margin influences, but not long-term market trends. Yes, we were price cost favorable this year, as we've shared previously, and we have -- we're continuing to focus on pricing with new product launches and where we've seen inflationary costs coming through. So we're working to continue to maintain that positive price/cost ratio. And we're seeing some slowing of course, in pricing in the market, but we'll expect to continue to have some of that.\nA \u2013 Mark Smith: Right. And again, when we give out for next year, then we'll, I'm sure you'll ask us about price cost. We'll be happy to share the dynamic. Yeah. So we'll launch the X15 here in North America next as you heard me say, it's performing well in China. We'll have a US version of that, of course, meeting the regulatory requirements here next year, and we'll have availability now through two of our OEMs. And we are seeing end customers testing and interested in that product will have the only heavy-duty natural gas product offered here in North America. So of course, that creates some opportunity for us as customers where they've got infrastructure, environmental goals or even operating cost benefits associated with natural gas will start to adopt that solution more. So there's some opportunity there for sure. Yeah. Really, on the same trajectory we've talked about previously with building up manufacturing capacity here in the US and Europe, continuing to have backlog growing. We are in the process of commissioning a 25-megawatt electrolyzer with Florida Power and Light over the course of this year. So another big project that we're delivering this year, and we continue to ramp up that business as we described previously."

Our host for today's call is Chris Clulow, VP of Investor Relations. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host. Chris, you may begin.\nChris Clulow: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the second quarter of 2023. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference.

With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off.\nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the second quarter that demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy. On April 3, United States President, Joe Biden, visited company facilities in Fridley, Minnesota to tour Accelera by Cummins, first U.S. manufacturing location for electrolyzers, a key technology to produce no-carbon hydrogen. Accelera is initially dedicating 89,000 square feet of the existing Cummins power generation facility in Fridley to electrolyzer production with the opportunity to expand to meet the growing demand. Accelera also reached a further milestone of electrolyzer order backlog totaling over $500 million at the end of the quarter. The Fridley facility will help address that growing demand, along with other capacity being added globally. Lastly, progress continues to be made on the separation of the Filtration business. On May 26, Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ATMU in connection with its initial public offering. Upon the completion of the IPO, Cummins retained approximately 80.5% of Atmus outstanding shares. The Atmus IPO generated $299 million of net proceeds and Atmus added $650 million of debt. Cummins realizes the benefit of the IPO proceedings and the debt issuance as Atmus will hold the debt at full separation. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products continued to be strong across many of our key markets and regions, resulting in record revenues in the second quarter of 2023. Revenues for the quarter were $8.6 billion, an increase of 31% compared to the second quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor, strong demand and improved pricing. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.1% compared to $1.1 billion or 16% a year ago. Second quarter 2023 results include $23 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. This compares to second quarter 2022 results, which include $47 million in recovery of amounts reserved related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia, offset by $29 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA percentage of 15.4% in the second quarter of 2023, represented a slight decline from the 15.7% we delivered in 2022, principally due to the addition of Meritor activity, which currently has a lower gross margin percentage than our other businesses and increased SG&A and development expenses. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the second quarter of 2022 as the benefits of higher volumes, pricing and the acquisition of Meritor exceeded the supply chain cost increases. The strong EBITDA performance of the business in the first half drove an increase in selling and administrative expenses versus the prior year as we recorded higher accruals related to our variable compensation plans during the quarter. Research and development expenses also increased in the second quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components and Accelera segments. As we noted previously, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. In the second quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement with sales of $1.2 billion and EBITDA of 12.2%. The improvement in the profitability from the first quarter EBITDA margin of 9.4% was driven by pricing to cover inflation, operational improvements and cost reduction activities, which more than offset material cost increases that we expect to persist through the second half of the year. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 31% to $5.3 billion, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand in our core markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 77,000 units, up 11% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, also up 11% from 2022. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 37,000 units in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 11% from 2022 levels, while our unit sales were 34,000, up 27% from 2022. We shipped 38,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the second quarter of 2023, flat with the 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 8%, driven primarily by positive net pricing. Revenues in North America power generation increased by 16% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply chain constraints eased modestly. Our international revenues increased by 32% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago, with the addition of Meritor and a strong demand across most markets. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.7 billion, an increase of 37% and as markets began to recover compared to a very weak second quarter of 2022, which was impaired by COVID shutdowns in Shanghai and other regions. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 279,000 units, an increase of 61% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 41,000, an increase of 63% due to increased penetration within our joint venture partners and new products launched to meet the NS VI standard. The light-duty market in China was up 21% from 2022 levels at 460,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 28,000, an increase of 23%. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 51,000 units, a decrease of 23% from 2022 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to weaker activity and construction. Our units sold were 8,000 units, an increase of 5%, driven by improved share with new and expanded customer relationships for both domestic and export usage. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 8% in the second quarter, primarily driven by a decline in the data center market. Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $724 million, an increase of 22% from the second quarter of a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 2%, while our shipments increased 1%. Power generation revenues increased by 75% in the second quarter, driven by strong economic activity and customer demand ahead of a July 1 emissions regulation change. Now let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full-year 2023 revenue guidance of up 15% to 20% versus last year. EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.7%. We now expect stronger revenue and profitability in both our Power Systems and Distribution segments than we did three months ago, offset by increased cost in the Accelera business. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 270,000 to 290,000 units in 2023. Supply chain constraints continue to limit our industry's collective ability to produce and while end customer demand remains strong currently, our current guidance forecasts lower industry truck production in the fourth quarter. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are projecting the market size to be 135,000 to 150,000 units, up 5% to 15% from 2022. This is an increase from our previous guidance by 10,000 units. Similar to heavy-duty, supply chain constraints continue to limit our ability to produce and fully meet end customer demand. However, through the rebalancing across our global plant efforts to improve the supply base, we have been able to increase our production, resulting in the improved outlook. The improvement in the medium-duty outlook was offset by decreases in our forecast for two other markets. North America construction is now expected to be down 10% to flat versus our previous guidance of flat to up 10%. Secondly, Brazil truck is expected to be down 30% to 40%, a decline from our prior guidance of down 10% to 20% as the market adjusts to Euro 6 equivalent emission standards. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be $140,000 to $150,000 in 2023. Volume levels in line with 2022. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase approximately 15% in 2023, driven by share growth, better volumes and content increases. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 10% to 20% improvement in the light-duty truck demand coming off the low market levels in 2022, consistent with prior guidance. Despite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we are continuing to see strong performance for our products, including the 15-liter natural gas engine, which we launched in 2021. Due to the fuel cost differential, approximately 20% of the heavy-duty market is expected to be natural gas powered by the end of 2023. In the short time since we launched our new natural gas product in China, our share has been ramping up with strong customer reception in the heavy-duty market, and we look forward to launching the 15-liter natural gas engine in North America in 2024. We expect China construction volumes to be flat to down 10%, in line with prior guidance, consistent with the tepid economy and weaker overall activity. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up approximately 6% in 2023, an improvement from our previous forecast of about 1%, propelled by stronger power generation and on-highway sales. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horse power markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat to up 10%, an improvement from our previous guidance of down 5% to up 5%. Revenues in global power generation markets are now expected to increase 15% to 20%, up from our previous guidance of a 10% to 15% increase, driven by non-residential construction and improvement in the data center markets. For Accelera, we expect full-year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, consistent with our previous guidance. As noted in my highlights, the electrolyzer market continues to gain momentum with our near-term focus on expanding capacity to meet the growing demand. As we scale up to serve the electrolyzer opportunity, continue to develop our products and support our customers in the field, costs are running higher than originally projected for the year. As a result, we have revised our EBITDA guidance for Accelera to an expected loss of $420 million to $440 million for 2023 versus our prior guidance of $370 million to $390 million. Within components, Cummins expects revenues contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% of sales, consistent with prior guidance. In summary, coming off a very strong first half where we produced record revenues and record EBITDA while delivering for our customers, we are maintaining our guidance of sales up 15% to 20% and EBITDA of 15% to 15.7%. Demand in most of our core markets is strong, while we continue to closely monitor global economic indicators. Should economic momentum slow, Cummins will remain in a strong position to keep investing in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our shareholders. Our guidance for the full-year implies weaker revenue in the second half of the year. While demand remained strong in several markets, a weaker outlook in China versus the first half, an expected decrease in the North American heavy-duty truck production in the fourth quarter and the previously mentioned North America construction and Brazil truck decrease are some of the factors driving the lower second half run rate. In view of the lowered forecasted revenues in the second half of the year, we expect to manage our operating expenses below the second quarter levels. During the quarter, we returned $223 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders. Shortly after quarter end, we announced a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.57 to $1.68 per share, the 14th consecutive year in which we have increased the dividend. The strong execution from the first quarter of 2023 continued into the second, resulting in record sales and strong profitability despite the ongoing challenges in our operating environment. I want to thank our Cummins employees who continue to work tirelessly to meet customer needs and respond to the strong demand levels by ensuring quality products, strengthening our customer relationships and navigating continued supply chain constraints. Our results reflect our focus on delivering strong operational performance, investing in future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and returning cash to our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark.\nMark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenues were a record $8.6 billion, up 31% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 31% and international sales increased 32%. Our organic sales growth rate was 12%, driven by improved pricing and strong end market demand for our products globally, with a balance of 19% increase in sales driven by the addition of Meritor. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1% overall. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.1% of sales for the quarter, including $23 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. EBITDA in the second quarter of 2022 was $1.1 billion or 16% of sales, including a one-time $47 million benefit related to the adjustment of our reserves as we suspended our operations in Russia and $29 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. Excluding the Atmus separation costs and the impact from Russia year ago, EBITDA in the second quarter of this year was 15.4% compared to 15.7% a year ago. Lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by the dilutive impact of Meritor, higher variable compensation costs, which showed up largely in our SG&A line and in higher development spending. To provide clarity on operational performance and comparison to guidance and excluding the costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and the impacts from Russia in my following comments. Now let's look in more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 24.9% of sales compared to $1.7 billion or 25.6% last year. As a percent of sales, gross margin decreased by 70 basis points as the benefits of higher volumes and improved pricing were offset by the dilutive impact of the Meritor acquisition and higher variable compensation expenses. Our Cummins Meritor business continued to show improvement in the second quarter and is performing in line with our expectations for the full-year. In fact, most of our businesses delivered gross margin expansion in the second quarter. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 14.3% of sales compared to $892 million or 13.5% last year. The increase in expenses was driven by the addition of Meritor, net of realized synergies, higher variable compensation, higher development costs as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth. Income from our joint ventures was $133 million, up $38 million from a year ago due to a slow recovery in demand in China. Other income was $24 million, an improvement of $42 million from a year ago. In the second quarter last year, we incurred $48 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our unqualified benefit plans, and those did not repeat this year, which largely explains the change in other income. Interest expense increased by $65 million due to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor and also rising interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the second quarter was 22.3%, including $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share of unfavorable discrete tax items. All in net earnings for the quarter were $720 million or $5.05 per diluted share compared to $702 million or $4.94 a year ago. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $483 million, $116 million lower than the second quarter last year, primarily due to higher working capital associated with the higher sales. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes the impact of Meritor and assumes that the operations of Atmus will be included in our consolidated results for the full-year. Segment results and guidance exclude the costs and benefits related to the separation of the filtration business. Components revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 76%. EBITDA percent decreased from 18.2% to 14.7%, with EBITDA dollars growing from $355 million to $504 million, both the big driver of the growth in EBITDA dollars and the decline in the percent was the addition of the Meritor business, which added $1.2 billion in sales and $152 million or 12.2% of sales EBITDA. For the Components segment, we expect 2023 revenues to increase between 32% and 37% and EBITDA margins in the range of 14.1% to 14.8%, in line with our previous guidance. Within components, Meritor revenues are expected to be between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion and EBITDA in the range of 10.3% to 11%, consistent with our previous guidance. In the Engine segment, second quarter revenues were $3 billion, an increase of 8% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.2% compared to 15.2% in 2022 due to higher development spending and higher variable compensation costs linked to the stronger overall performance of Cummins year-over-year. In 2023, we project revenues for the engine business will increase 2% to 7% and EBITDA expected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5%, unchanged from our prior year guidance. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $2.6 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 11.5% compared to 11.2% a year ago. We now expect 2023 distribution revenues to be up 10% to 15% and EBITDA in the range of 11.7% to 12.4% with sales increasing 5% from our prior outlook and margins up 40 basis points, extending the track record of margin expansion in this business. In the Power Systems segment, revenues were a record $1.5 billion, an increase of 21% and EBITDA increased by 58%. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA rose from 10.6% to 13.8% of sales, driven by higher power generation volumes and improved pricing. We have an intense focus on improving the results of the Power Systems business, and this has yielded clear margin expansion over the past year, and we see much more potential for earnings growth going forward. Results for the second quarter include $18 million of costs associated with actions that we have taken to drive further improvement as we seek to transform the long-term earnings power of this business. In 2023, we expect revenues for Power Systems to be up 8% to 13%, an increase of 3% from our previous outlook. EBITDA is now projected to be 14.3% to 15%, an increase of 60 basis points from our last forecast. Accelera revenues more than doubled to $85 million, driven by higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market and the additions of the electric powertrain portion of Meritor business and Siemens commercial vehicle business. Our EBITDA loss was $114 million as we continue to invest in the product infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. In 2023, we anticipate revenues to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million, unchanged from our previous outlook. And loss is now expected to be in the range of $420 million to $440 million, an increase of $50 million in those losses as we increase the level of resources dedicated to successfully ramp up and meet growing electrolyzer demand. As Jen mentioned, our full-year outlook for the company is unchanged. We maintain our previous guidance with revenues expected to be up 15% to 20% and from last year and EBITDA margins in the range of 15% to 15.7%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior outlook. In 2023, we will continue to focus deploying cash to reinvest in our business, grow the dividend and reduce debt. In summary, we delivered record solid profitability in the second quarter of 2023 with a key feature being the improvement in the gross margins in most parts of our business. In the second half of the year, our focus remains the same, delivering strong incremental margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, reducing inventory levels and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in lower carbon technologies. Our guidance does imply lower revenues in the second half of the year, and we will manage our operating expenses below second quarter levels accordingly. Thank you for your interest today. We delivered solid second quarter and continue to make good progress in executing our strategy. Now let me turn it back over to Chris.\nChris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have an additional question, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are ready for our first question.\nOperator: At this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We are now ready to begin. Our first question comes from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJamie Cook: Hi, good morning. I guess two questions. One, the engine margin, I\u2019m just trying to understand. They were a little weaker than I thought. I understand there\u2019s some compensation and investment in there, but your JV income was really high as well and margins in the back half versus the first half were lower. So can you just help us understand what\u2019s going on, on the engine margin side and how to think about, like, what\u2019s required in investment over the longer-term? And does that continue to weigh on the engine margin? And then my second question, Jen, just bigger picture. I know you don\u2019t want to guide to 2024 \u2013 for 2024, but I know you\u2019re very close with your customers. So as you look out in 2024, given some of the industry forecasts that are out there, which markets are you more after this [indiscernible] markets that you\u2019re getting a little more cautious that we could see declines? Thank you.\nMark Smith: Okay. I\u2019ll go with the first question, Jamie. Thank you. Yes, so in the Engine business, there are really three themes to the numbers. One, we\u2019ve raised the investment level in engineering, really to support all the additional business that we\u2019ve won and meet future emissions and drive that profitable growth. Two, this is the business, more recently, it\u2019s continued to face some continued inflation on material costs. We\u2019re net pricing positive, but we\u2019ve also continued to experience some increase in material costs. And then for the second half of the year, really, we\u2019re expecting China JV earnings to weaken, which is typical having a weaker second half than the first half. And then yes, as you mentioned, the incentive compensation \u2013 we\u2019ll describe it as an issue. It is a factor in our results across the company in that our performance is exceeding our internal plan and we trued up our accruals in the second quarter, which happens from time to time and also compares to a quarter a year ago when we were lowering them. But the business issues are really the increased investment and then the lower JV earnings in the second half of the year.\nJennifer Rumsey: And on your second question, Jamie, in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the market, the performance of our products continues to be very positive and strong. And what I would say is my conversations in the \u2013 in recent months have continued to have conversations with customers, in particular in the medium-duty space, and even in the electrolyzer space, there\u2019s a lot of demand and interest in Cummins products. And I noted that we\u2019ve made some shifts in our global plants to increase capacity and medium-duty for North America to meet that demand. So there\u2019s still really strong demand in that market. And we\u2019re cyclical business. We\u2019re used to being a cyclical business, I think this is going to likely be a more gentle cycle across markets than what we\u2019ve typically seen, but we do see some indications in certain markets, a little bit softening in aftermarket, some anticipated down days and our guidance implies heavy-duty a little bit lower in the fourth quarter, in particular, construction a little bit lower. And China, really not growing significantly, seasonally softer in the second half versus first half. So I still feel quite good about market outlook and how we\u2019re performing. And yes, we think the Q2 is going to be our revenue peak and we\u2019re \u2013 our guide reflects that and we\u2019re taking actions to make sure we\u2019re prioritizing the places we need to invest for the future while also managing headcount discretionary spending and just SG&A down for the second half of the year.\nJamie Cook: Thank you.\nMark Smith: Thanks Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nMark Smith: Hey, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Jennifer. Hi. I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about the interest that you\u2019re seeing from your customers in alternative fuel technologies. Over the course of the quarter, we have the positive EPA mandate essentially for a landfill gas, given the changes in the RIN structure. I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about what you\u2019re seeing from your customers on interest in the 15-liter engine in North America specifically for that product. And any other comments that you would add on internal combustion hydrogen or other moving pieces, based on the visibility on the regulatory side? Thanks.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, great. Thanks, Jerry. Yes, as you noted, I think there\u2019s growing interest in what I call some of these bridge technologies, alternate fuels and engines, the natural gas product, we\u2019re seeing growth in that in China. We\u2019re going to launch that here. We expect to see some success in that market and looking at hydrogen engines where we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019re developing those and trying to figure out in which markets they\u2019ll play a role. It\u2019s slow going because of the infrastructure build out that\u2019s required. And so we\u2019re really focused on investing to have the right products, but at the right time. And so you\u2019re still going to see a lot of demand for diesel in the next few years. One key thing that happened this quarter was progress with the car regulation and the alignment now to EPA in \u201827, which is a real positive. So we could focus on a nationwide solution and then some of these bridge and zero emission solutions to start to adopt and applications and places where the infrastructure exists.\nJerry Revich: Super. And Mark, can I ask within components, your EBITDA margins were up a touch sequentially 2Q versus 1Q, given just all the different piece in the portfolio between Meritor and Atmus. Can you just talk about how the different parts of business are performing?\nMark Smith: Yes. I think in that business, they\u2019re all performing well. Obviously, the change in the mix has an impact, but clearly, Meritor results stepped up from the first quarter. So that was probably the biggest thing to change. I don\u2019t want to talk about Atmus. They\u2019re going to have their own earnings call shortly. But I would just say in general, the performance trends are strong across that portfolio.\nJerry Revich: I thought I\u2019d try. Thanks.\nMark Smith: Thank you, Jerry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nTim Thein: Thank you. Good morning. The first one is on power systems. I\u2019m just curious if maybe you could give an update there on anything of note within the order boards. I\u2019m guessing that as you walk through some of the end markets, a lot of the revisions were to the upside. And yet, if you look at the second half revenue growth, there is a slight step down from the first. So I\u2019m just curious, is that a capacity issue or has there been any changes in terms of, some of the individual end markets. Just curious, your thoughts on that.\nMark Smith: Hey, Tim, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. I think the only market change, which isn\u2019t new this quarter that\u2019s been coming for a few months has really been a weakening order board on some of the consumer side, particularly the RV market where we\u2019ve got a very strong presence, not surprising with interest rates where they are that overall market started to \u2013 the demand started to drift down. So I would say that\u2019s the only one with some momentum change. I mean, oil and gas, there are different opinions at different points in time. That\u2019s the one clear trend I would say right now. And then you\u2019re right. The backlog is seeing us through this year. So we\u2019re watching everything closely. But I would say, it\u2019s stable outside of RV.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. And the thing we\u2019ve been able to do, we had a lot of supply challenges in that business last year. So through the first half, we\u2019ve been able to really produce at a better level. And we see strong demand in particular data center demand, the order board is out through next year for the data center market. We revised \u2013 you heard us revise mining up a little bit. So we\u2019re seeing strength in parts of those markets. And then as Mark noted, it\u2019s a little bit of softening in other parts of that market. But the situation there is really stabilized from where it was last year.\nMark Smith: And then, of course, we\u2019re pleased with the step up in performance over the last year. And then you heard in my comments that we\u2019ve taken yet more actions to keep boosting that profitability up. So we\u2019re very pleased with the momentum in that business.\nTim Thein: Yes. Okay, good. And just \u2013 and then on distribution. So the \u2013 and maybe tying back to, Jen, to your comments on aftermarket activity. But if you look at parts had been in the kind of mid-40% as a percentage of distribution sales and it stepped down. I imagine there was some mix headwind associated with that, but \u2013 and maybe just is there an area worth calling out, typically that business can kind of be a good early warning signal? So maybe just a little bit more color on what you mentioned earlier in terms of that?\nJennifer Rumsey: No, I mean, the color I'll give there is, we were at incredibly high aftermarket levels because what was happening was customers couldn\u2019t buy new trucks. So they were using trucks longer that drove more aftermarket demand. And so it\u2019s still very healthy. We believe we\u2019ve seen some \u2013 we\u2019re seeing some inventory adjustment happening. And that the overall aftermarket demand has come down a little bit, but it\u2019s still very, very healthy to your point, the aftermarket business for us from our margin perspective is a favorable one, but we still see it being healthy is what I would say.\nTim Thein: Got it.\nMark Smith: A bit more signs, it\u2019s leveling off than accelerating, I would say, Tim.\nTim Thein: Yes, okay. Thanks for the time.\nMark Smith: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Raso: Hi, thank you. The comments about truck production in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a little more color on that in the sense of magnitude? How much is this your perspective versus already been laid out by your customers? And how to think about sort of dovetailing that into conversations for pricing for 2024?\nMark Smith: So I would say, first of all, it\u2019s a shorter quarter just because of the holiday periods. I think the industry has a lower build rate building at Q4, so that\u2019s not coming specific. And then, yes, I think the rest is our assumption, David. It is not current outside of the shorter quarter. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re hearing from customers at this point in time. The question is really going to be what are the order momentum for the rest of this year and what\u2019s sentiment as we get towards that end of the year? That\u2019s how I would characterize what we\u2019ve got embedded in our guidance and that doesn\u2019t change. We\u2019ve had that instance the start of the year.\nDavid Raso: That\u2019s what I was trying to figure out. Have you heard a tone change? Nothing to do with less production days. Just truly daily line rates being communicated. Hey, we\u2019re taking it down in the fourth quarter or so just your view. I\u2019m just trying to make sure we understand\u2026\nJennifer Rumsey: It\u2019s a tricky one. And as you can imagine, we are debating this a lot. So as I said, a little bit softer aftermarket is typically an indication that we\u2019re going to see some softening in the market more down days in the fourth quarter. There\u2019s just uncertainty from an economic perspective and the typical cyclical nature that we see in our markets that is causing us to anticipate in the fourth quarter. And as we look to next year that the market size is going to start to come down a little bit. As I said, I think it\u2019s a softer cycle than we would typically see, but it just \u2013 it\u2019s at a very high level right now. We \u2013 our Jamestown is producing as much as they can.\nMark Smith: Yes. We\u2019re not trying to signal some Cummins specific issue here, David. It\u2019s just assumption about the market activity at the end of the year.\nDavid Raso: That\u2019s fine. And the question on pricing?\nMark Smith: Can you repeat that, David, sorry. I don\u2019t think I pick it up.\nDavid Raso: The conversations for 2024 on pricing, and I know you have supply agreements, but just trying to get a sense of \u2013 and you might be able to take your costs down as much, but I think people are just trying to figure out, is there some price give back after the last 18 months or so very strong price increases. And I just want to see if you could provide some perspective on early conversations you\u2019re having for your truck engine pricing?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, look, we\u2019re \u2013 our goal is to continue to balance the price with the cost pressure that we\u2019ve been seeing, which is stabilized. And then we\u2019ll launch some new products next year as well. So that will allow us to continue to have those conversations with customers, but really nothing dramatic there.\nDavid Raso: Okay. Thank you very much.\nMark Smith: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRobert Wertheimer: Hi, I also had a question on price and then maybe just generally on the truck market and your market share and mix developments. So the first one is truck OEMs have had some really good success in margin as prices have gone up. I\u2019m actually just a little bit curious mechanically, when a customer walks in to buy a truck, and they choose either Cummins Engine or the OEMs engine, you don\u2019t control the price of that engine at retail, right? So, maybe, I guess, in effect, the truck OEM would be making margin on the increased price of the truck and engine. Is that the way to think about it? And do you still have catch up to come there?\nJennifer Rumsey: Correct. We don\u2019t control the pricing that happens to the end customer. We have long-term agreements and we price our engine and powertrain solutions and options to the OEM. And we typically follow those long-term agreements with metal market adjustments and have done some inflationary adjustments with them over the last few years, but we don\u2019t fundamentally dictate that pricing to the end customer. Our goal is to have a product offered to work with the end customers to create goal for our product through the performance of our powertrain compared to others in the market.\nMark Smith: We made a big shift away from influence in retail price 20 years ago.\nRobert Wertheimer: Okay. No, I think that\u2019s clear. And then just a big part...\nJennifer Rumsey: I was going to say, of course, in the heavy-duty space, a big factor and customer choices as fuel economy.\nRobert Wertheimer: Got it. Second one is just trying to get up to date on mix shifts in North American truck and how it flows through for Cummins. So, if long haul truck declines in vocational/day cab come up and I guess medium-duty comes up. I\u2019m just trying to sort out, which of those are market share/mix negative for you and not? So is your market share in long haul higher than your market share in vocational, or I guess your market share in medium-duty quite high? So I\u2019m just trying to think about how the evolving mix in the truck market affects Cummins?\nMark Smith: Yes. I mean, the main delta in all those things is \u2013 whilst our share has gone up in heavy-duty over the last couple of years and it\u2019s very strong. Medium-duty, it\u2019s much stronger, right? That\u2019s the main difference. And then I would say it\u2019s a different kind of angle to your question, Rob, the larger fleets, we tend to have higher share with the larger fleets than we do with the overall \u2013 within heavy duty than the overall market itself because that\u2019s where we\u2019ve got those deeper, stronger relationships. So there\u2019s a theme that\u2019s been support as larger fleets are becoming more effective, more competitive. That\u2019s been a trend that\u2019s been helping us. But individual take and we\u2019re really getting into splitting as the trend has been shared going up in heavy and in medium.\nRobert Wertheimer: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. So, can you update us on your price realization and price cost assumptions for the year?\nMark Smith: Well, yes, we\u2019ll be at about 3.5% to 3.75% plus on pricing. And on costs, we\u2019ll be about 1.5% inflation.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. And on your full-year guide, I\u2019m just trying to understand, the segment sales guide was raised for both distribution and power systems, but the full-year guide was unchanged. So can you help me bridge that?\nMark Smith: Yes, we really \u2013 well, Chris, why don\u2019t you go?\nChris Clulow: Yes. So, yes, Tami, you\u2019re right. We did raise in power systems and distributions. And as we looked at the overall guide, just given the uncertainty in the markets we elected not to change the overall, it probably would trend towards the higher end of that revenue guide is what we\u2019re looking at right now, but we didn\u2019t want to change it at this point.\nTami Zakaria: Okay got it. Thank you so much.\nMark Smith: I think construction, though, construction and Brazil truck were the two key areas. And then I would say parts, it\u2019s not dramatically different, but it\u2019s leveling out. Those are the three themes that are going \u2013 go in the other way or not improving.\nTami Zakaria: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the truck market messaging again. I have the sense that you guys were getting increasingly confident about the business for 2023 and thinking that 2024 might not be too much of a downturn, if at all. So has that thinking changed at all? And was that aftermarket trend you mentioned sort of, like, a catalyst for different thinking, or is it more just something in the macro that\u2019s gotten your thinking changed, or is it not really changed at all?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, I don\u2019t \u2013 it really hasn\u2019t changed notably from the thinking before and that this idea that we\u2019re going to see a gentle cycle. So, some downturn in the market, not dramatic and anticipating that, that happening. And it\u2019s really dependent on some of these broader economic things and what really happens, how that plays out.\nMark Smith: I think it\u2019s correct that the forecast for the industry are a lower Q4, right, just because of the number of the production days in the quarter. Part of it is just math for the remainder of the year, which is not. And then part of it is just history tells us if there is some erosion in confidence, which we haven\u2019t seen in customer orders. Just to be clear, if there is, we tend to have a bigger fade into the December holiday period and a slow ramp up. So we just \u2013 we built that into our guidance at the start of the year. That\u2019s simple as that.\nJennifer Rumsey: But in the meantime, layered on that, what you\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re improving gross margin across the business, right? The base business gross margin performance has been strong, Meritor has continued to improve quarter-over-quarter. And we think now is the time to start managing our operating costs, expecting that we\u2019re going to see some downturn and then continue to look at places as you\u2019ve seen us do some structural things to improve the business and the focus this year has really been within the Power Systems business where we\u2019re doing that.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. And it sounds like part of your second half outlook is a bit weaker trend in China. How are you thinking about the potential for stimulus there? And whether there\u2019s any chance for upside still that might come out of that?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. At this point, we\u2019re continuing to assume there\u2019s no stimulus. There was, in a meeting, a few weeks ago, well, the \u2013 I think the government recognizes that they want to try to improve the economy. They want to do it and fiscally responsible stable way. And so we\u2019re not assuming stimulus. China is playing out pretty much as we anticipated some improvement off of a very low 2022 and typical seasonality between first half and second half. And if there\u2019s stimulus that comes in that impacts demand that would impact our outlook as well.\nMark Smith: Yes, but I would say that just seem the most likely size source of upside to our guidance right now.\nSteven Fisher: Got it. Thank you very much.\nMark Smith: I\u2019m worried about it. Just looking for more and there is much sign of it right now.\nSteven Fisher: Right. Makes sense. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Elkott with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nMatthew Elkott: Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you guys still expect EBITDA neutral for Accelera by 2027, or are there any emerging new structural costs and investments needed that could change that timeline?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. We are still \u2013 with the strategy we have in place right now, we continue to work towards the EBITDA neutral in 2027. A big piece of that is this electrolyzer revenue growth as you saw with the comments on backlog that we continue to be confident in the outlook there and we \u2013 the increased investment this year is really focused on making sure we\u2019ve got the product and the supply chain right to enable us to do that.\nMatthew Elkott: Okay. And Jennifer, just one more question here on the construction side. The tempered outlook for the kind of latter part of the year, data centers are strong and public sector, non-residential construction is strong. Can you talk about some of the end markets driving a somewhat tempered outlook for construction in North America?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So, our outlook for U.S. construction down to flat, right? So data \u2013 and data centers would show up for us and power generation data center market is definitely strong. There\u2019s parts of the market where construction, infrastructure investment and construction remains strong and there\u2019s other segments of that market with rising interest rates and that we\u2019re seeing things.\nMark Smith: Part of it is just a timing issue of like what\u2019s the replenishment of the fleet been a lot of ordering of engines for construction equipment. So it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s just the demand on us is kind of leveled out, right now. And again, we\u2019ll see where that is going.\nMatthew Elkott: Does any of the data center construction market, does any of it show up in the \u2013 in construction for you guys, or it\u2019s all most of your exposure to business\u2026\nMark Smith: That\u2019s in our Power Systems segment.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, it\u2019s not a huge factor for us. I mean, the data center factor for us is that they buy these very large gensets for backup power and that drives significant revenue for power systems. The actual construction itself\u2026\nMark Smith: It\u2019s hard for us to track exactly where the construct \u2013 we\u2019re selling to the OEMs sometimes rental.\nMatthew Elkott: That makes sense. Thank you so much.\nMark Smith: Thank you.\nChris Clulow: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to expand if I could on Accelera and the increased investment spend this year about $50 million. I think you mentioned a couple of times it\u2019s really to get electrolyzer production and product right. It is an operating expense, right? So is this mainly engineering resources? Maybe you can give us a little color on what you felt you needed to spend on to get ready for this ramp? And maybe you can even put in the context of some of the industry and policy changes that you\u2019ve seen come through, obviously, some significant ones over the last year?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Yes. The industry and policy changes drive that optimism and the outlook and the growing demand, the higher cost of shifts, not capital expenses of the plants as much as it is operating costs in engineering and in customer support as we\u2019re scaling up that product or running higher than we had previously forecasted.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. So customer support as well as product engineering. All right. That\u2019s helpful. But just to make sure we understand, there\u2019s no change to the revenue guidance. The current book of business, which I think is more weighted towards EV, I mean, is that delivering kind of the expected margin contribution? We hear mixed indicators on EV adoption, particularly in North America, would love to sort of understand where that side of the business is tracking versus your expectations?\nMark Smith: Right. So on the EV side, no, our demand today is mostly concentrated in the bus markets. I would say our margins have definitely been improving. The Accelera leadership team has done good work on improving the margins even with, yes, relatively modest, albeit increasing demand at this point in time. Yes, so we\u2019re really looking for those next waves of demand, but the margins have been improving there. And on the electrolyzers, the demand keeps going up. The issue is not demand. It\u2019s just making sure that we\u2019re ready. There aren\u2019t that many electrolyzers, new ones out in the field yet, right? We\u2019re still building that capability. Yes, we\u2019re shipping some, but that\u2019s going to be going up to just making sure history shows a bit of investment now. It pays off multiple times in the long run.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Here\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s a couple of things that we watch on this, how the market develops. So on the electrolyzer side, there\u2019s investments, but the actual details of how that government money flows and when it flows are still being defined. So that is a bit of a timing impact on some of that. And then in the electrified powertrain, there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty beyond the bus market where you\u2019ve got cities and corporations that have incentives and want to electrify on exactly how that infrastructure is going to build out. So there\u2019s regulations that\u2019s going to start to drive more of that, but a lot of uncertainty I would say on the exact pace of that.\nNoah Kaye: Appreciate it. Good to see you making the investments. Thanks so much.\nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you.\nMark Smith: Yes. Thanks, Noah.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Chris Clulow for any closing remarks.\nChris Clulow: Great. Thanks very much. That concludes our teleconference for today. Thank you all for participating and your continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s Cummins Incorporated second quarter earnings conference call. Thank you, everyone, for your participation. Have a wonderful rest of your day.",

            "name": "Mark Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Second quarter revenues were a record $8.6 billion, up 31% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 31% and international sales increased 32%. Our organic sales growth rate was 12%, driven by improved pricing and strong end market demand for our products globally, with a balance of 19% increase in sales driven by the addition of Meritor. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1% overall. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.1% of sales for the quarter, including $23 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. EBITDA in the second quarter of 2022 was $1.1 billion or 16% of sales, including a one-time $47 million benefit related to the adjustment of our reserves as we suspended our operations in Russia and $29 million of costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus. Excluding the Atmus separation costs and the impact from Russia year ago, EBITDA in the second quarter of this year was 15.4% compared to 15.7% a year ago. Lower EBITDA percent was driven primarily by the dilutive impact of Meritor, higher variable compensation costs, which showed up largely in our SG&A line and in higher development spending. To provide clarity on operational performance and comparison to guidance and excluding the costs associated with the planned separation of Atmus and the impacts from Russia in my following comments. Now let's look in more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 24.9% of sales compared to $1.7 billion or 25.6% last year. As a percent of sales, gross margin decreased by 70 basis points as the benefits of higher volumes and improved pricing were offset by the dilutive impact of the Meritor acquisition and higher variable compensation expenses. Our Cummins Meritor business continued to show improvement in the second quarter and is performing in line with our expectations for the full-year. In fact, most of our businesses delivered gross margin expansion in the second quarter. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 14.3% of sales compared to $892 million or 13.5% last year. The increase in expenses was driven by the addition of Meritor, net of realized synergies, higher variable compensation, higher development costs as we continue to invest in the new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth. Income from our joint ventures was $133 million, up $38 million from a year ago due to a slow recovery in demand in China. Other income was $24 million, an improvement of $42 million from a year ago. In the second quarter last year, we incurred $48 million of mark-to-market losses on investments that underpin our unqualified benefit plans, and those did not repeat this year, which largely explains the change in other income. Interest expense increased by $65 million due to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor and also rising interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the second quarter was 22.3%, including $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share of unfavorable discrete tax items. All in net earnings for the quarter were $720 million or $5.05 per diluted share compared to $702 million or $4.94 a year ago. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $483 million, $116 million lower than the second quarter last year, primarily due to higher working capital associated with the higher sales. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes the impact of Meritor and assumes that the operations of Atmus will be included in our consolidated results for the full-year. Segment results and guidance exclude the costs and benefits related to the separation of the filtration business. Components revenue was $3.4 billion, an increase of 76%. EBITDA percent decreased from 18.2% to 14.7%, with EBITDA dollars growing from $355 million to $504 million, both the big driver of the growth in EBITDA dollars and the decline in the percent was the addition of the Meritor business, which added $1.2 billion in sales and $152 million or 12.2% of sales EBITDA. For the Components segment, we expect 2023 revenues to increase between 32% and 37% and EBITDA margins in the range of 14.1% to 14.8%, in line with our previous guidance. Within components, Meritor revenues are expected to be between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion and EBITDA in the range of 10.3% to 11%, consistent with our previous guidance. In the Engine segment, second quarter revenues were $3 billion, an increase of 8% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.2% compared to 15.2% in 2022 due to higher development spending and higher variable compensation costs linked to the stronger overall performance of Cummins year-over-year. In 2023, we project revenues for the engine business will increase 2% to 7% and EBITDA expected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5%, unchanged from our prior year guidance. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 15% from a year ago to a record $2.6 billion. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales to 11.5% compared to 11.2% a year ago. We now expect 2023 distribution revenues to be up 10% to 15% and EBITDA in the range of 11.7% to 12.4% with sales increasing 5% from our prior outlook and margins up 40 basis points, extending the track record of margin expansion in this business. In the Power Systems segment, revenues were a record $1.5 billion, an increase of 21% and EBITDA increased by 58%. As a percent of revenue, EBITDA rose from 10.6% to 13.8% of sales, driven by higher power generation volumes and improved pricing. We have an intense focus on improving the results of the Power Systems business, and this has yielded clear margin expansion over the past year, and we see much more potential for earnings growth going forward. Results for the second quarter include $18 million of costs associated with actions that we have taken to drive further improvement as we seek to transform the long-term earnings power of this business. In 2023, we expect revenues for Power Systems to be up 8% to 13%, an increase of 3% from our previous outlook. EBITDA is now projected to be 14.3% to 15%, an increase of 60 basis points from our last forecast. Accelera revenues more than doubled to $85 million, driven by higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market and the additions of the electric powertrain portion of Meritor business and Siemens commercial vehicle business. Our EBITDA loss was $114 million as we continue to invest in the product infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. In 2023, we anticipate revenues to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million, unchanged from our previous outlook. And loss is now expected to be in the range of $420 million to $440 million, an increase of $50 million in those losses as we increase the level of resources dedicated to successfully ramp up and meet growing electrolyzer demand. As Jen mentioned, our full-year outlook for the company is unchanged. We maintain our previous guidance with revenues expected to be up 15% to 20% and from last year and EBITDA margins in the range of 15% to 15.7%. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior outlook. In 2023, we will continue to focus deploying cash to reinvest in our business, grow the dividend and reduce debt. In summary, we delivered record solid profitability in the second quarter of 2023 with a key feature being the improvement in the gross margins in most parts of our business. In the second half of the year, our focus remains the same, delivering strong incremental margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, reducing inventory levels and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in lower carbon technologies. Our guidance does imply lower revenues in the second half of the year, and we will manage our operating expenses below second quarter levels accordingly. Thank you for your interest today. We delivered solid second quarter and continue to make good progress in executing our strategy. Now let me turn it back over to Chris. Okay. I'll go with the first question, Jamie. Thank you. Yes, so in the Engine business, there are really three themes to the numbers. One, we've raised the investment level in engineering, really to support all the additional business that we've won and meet future emissions and drive that profitable growth. Two, this is the business, more recently, it's continued to face some continued inflation on material costs. We're net pricing positive, but we've also continued to experience some increase in material costs. And then for the second half of the year, really, we're expecting China JV earnings to weaken, which is typical having a weaker second half than the first half. And then yes, as you mentioned, the incentive compensation \u2013 we'll describe it as an issue. It is a factor in our results across the company in that our performance is exceeding our internal plan and we trued up our accruals in the second quarter, which happens from time to time and also compares to a quarter a year ago when we were lowering them. But the business issues are really the increased investment and then the lower JV earnings in the second half of the year. Thanks Jamie. Hey, Jerry. Yes. I think in that business, they're all performing well. Obviously, the change in the mix has an impact, but clearly, Meritor results stepped up from the first quarter. So that was probably the biggest thing to change. I don't want to talk about Atmus. They're going to have their own earnings call shortly. But I would just say in general, the performance trends are strong across that portfolio. Thank you, Jerry. Hey, Tim, it's Mark. Thanks for the question. I think the only market change, which isn't new this quarter that's been coming for a few months has really been a weakening order board on some of the consumer side, particularly the RV market where we've got a very strong presence, not surprising with interest rates where they are that overall market started to \u2013 the demand started to drift down. So I would say that's the only one with some momentum change. I mean, oil and gas, there are different opinions at different points in time. That's the one clear trend I would say right now. And then you're right. The backlog is seeing us through this year. So we're watching everything closely. But I would say, it's stable outside of RV. And then, of course, we're pleased with the step up in performance over the last year. And then you heard in my comments that we've taken yet more actions to keep boosting that profitability up. So we're very pleased with the momentum in that business. A bit more signs, it's leveling off than accelerating, I would say, Tim. Thank you. So I would say, first of all, it's a shorter quarter just because of the holiday periods. I think the industry has a lower build rate building at Q4, so that's not coming specific. And then, yes, I think the rest is our assumption, David. It is not current outside of the shorter quarter. That's not what we're hearing from customers at this point in time. The question is really going to be what are the order momentum for the rest of this year and what's sentiment as we get towards that end of the year? That's how I would characterize what we've got embedded in our guidance and that doesn't change. We've had that instance the start of the year. Yes. We're not trying to signal some Cummins specific issue here, David. It's just assumption about the market activity at the end of the year. Can you repeat that, David, sorry. I don't think I pick it up. Thanks, David. We made a big shift away from influence in retail price 20 years ago. Yes. I mean, the main delta in all those things is \u2013 whilst our share has gone up in heavy-duty over the last couple of years and it's very strong. Medium-duty, it's much stronger, right? That's the main difference. And then I would say it's a different kind of angle to your question, Rob, the larger fleets, we tend to have higher share with the larger fleets than we do with the overall \u2013 within heavy duty than the overall market itself because that's where we've got those deeper, stronger relationships. So there's a theme that's been support as larger fleets are becoming more effective, more competitive. That's been a trend that's been helping us. But individual take and we're really getting into splitting as the trend has been shared going up in heavy and in medium. Well, yes, we'll be at about 3.5% to 3.75% plus on pricing. And on costs, we'll be about 1.5% inflation. Yes, we really \u2013 well, Chris, why don't you go? I think construction, though, construction and Brazil truck were the two key areas. And then I would say parts, it's not dramatically different, but it's leveling out. Those are the three themes that are going \u2013 go in the other way or not improving. I think it's correct that the forecast for the industry are a lower Q4, right, just because of the number of the production days in the quarter. Part of it is just math for the remainder of the year, which is not. And then part of it is just history tells us if there is some erosion in confidence, which we haven't seen in customer orders. Just to be clear, if there is, we tend to have a bigger fade into the December holiday period and a slow ramp up. So we just \u2013 we built that into our guidance at the start of the year. That's simple as that. Yes, but I would say that just seem the most likely size source of upside to our guidance right now. I'm worried about it. Just looking for more and there is much sign of it right now. Part of it is just a timing issue of like what's the replenishment of the fleet been a lot of ordering of engines for construction equipment. So it doesn't necessarily mean it's just the demand on us is kind of leveled out, right now. And again, we'll see where that is going. That's in our Power Systems segment. It's hard for us to track exactly where the construct \u2013 we're selling to the OEMs sometimes rental. Thank you. Right. So on the EV side, no, our demand today is mostly concentrated in the bus markets. I would say our margins have definitely been improving. The Accelera leadership team has done good work on improving the margins even with, yes, relatively modest, albeit increasing demand at this point in time. Yes, so we're really looking for those next waves of demand, but the margins have been improving there. And on the electrolyzers, the demand keeps going up. The issue is not demand. It's just making sure that we're ready. There aren't that many electrolyzers, new ones out in the field yet, right? We're still building that capability. Yes, we're shipping some, but that's going to be going up to just making sure history shows a bit of investment now. It pays off multiple times in the long run. Yes. Thanks, Noah."

            "name": "Jennifer Rumsey",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the second quarter that demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy. On April 3, United States President, Joe Biden, visited company facilities in Fridley, Minnesota to tour Accelera by Cummins, first U.S. manufacturing location for electrolyzers, a key technology to produce no-carbon hydrogen. Accelera is initially dedicating 89,000 square feet of the existing Cummins power generation facility in Fridley to electrolyzer production with the opportunity to expand to meet the growing demand. Accelera also reached a further milestone of electrolyzer order backlog totaling over $500 million at the end of the quarter. The Fridley facility will help address that growing demand, along with other capacity being added globally. Lastly, progress continues to be made on the separation of the Filtration business. On May 26, Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ATMU in connection with its initial public offering. Upon the completion of the IPO, Cummins retained approximately 80.5% of Atmus outstanding shares. The Atmus IPO generated $299 million of net proceeds and Atmus added $650 million of debt. Cummins realizes the benefit of the IPO proceedings and the debt issuance as Atmus will hold the debt at full separation. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products continued to be strong across many of our key markets and regions, resulting in record revenues in the second quarter of 2023. Revenues for the quarter were $8.6 billion, an increase of 31% compared to the second quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor, strong demand and improved pricing. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.1% compared to $1.1 billion or 16% a year ago. Second quarter 2023 results include $23 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. This compares to second quarter 2022 results, which include $47 million in recovery of amounts reserved related to the indefinite suspension of operations in Russia, offset by $29 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding those items, EBITDA percentage of 15.4% in the second quarter of 2023, represented a slight decline from the 15.7% we delivered in 2022, principally due to the addition of Meritor activity, which currently has a lower gross margin percentage than our other businesses and increased SG&A and development expenses. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the second quarter of 2022 as the benefits of higher volumes, pricing and the acquisition of Meritor exceeded the supply chain cost increases. The strong EBITDA performance of the business in the first half drove an increase in selling and administrative expenses versus the prior year as we recorded higher accruals related to our variable compensation plans during the quarter. Research and development expenses also increased in the second quarter as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components and Accelera segments. As we noted previously, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. In the second quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement with sales of $1.2 billion and EBITDA of 12.2%. The improvement in the profitability from the first quarter EBITDA margin of 9.4% was driven by pricing to cover inflation, operational improvements and cost reduction activities, which more than offset material cost increases that we expect to persist through the second half of the year. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 31% to $5.3 billion, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand in our core markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter was 77,000 units, up 11% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, also up 11% from 2022. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 37,000 units in the second quarter of 2023, an increase of 11% from 2022 levels, while our unit sales were 34,000, up 27% from 2022. We shipped 38,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the second quarter of 2023, flat with the 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America increased by 8%, driven primarily by positive net pricing. Revenues in North America power generation increased by 16% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply chain constraints eased modestly. Our international revenues increased by 32% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago, with the addition of Meritor and a strong demand across most markets. Second quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.7 billion, an increase of 37% and as markets began to recover compared to a very weak second quarter of 2022, which was impaired by COVID shutdowns in Shanghai and other regions. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 279,000 units, an increase of 61% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were 41,000, an increase of 63% due to increased penetration within our joint venture partners and new products launched to meet the NS VI standard. The light-duty market in China was up 21% from 2022 levels at 460,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 28,000, an increase of 23%. Industry demand for excavators in the second quarter was 51,000 units, a decrease of 23% from 2022 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to weaker activity and construction. Our units sold were 8,000 units, an increase of 5%, driven by improved share with new and expanded customer relationships for both domestic and export usage. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 8% in the second quarter, primarily driven by a decline in the data center market. Second quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $724 million, an increase of 22% from the second quarter of a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 2%, while our shipments increased 1%. Power generation revenues increased by 75% in the second quarter, driven by strong economic activity and customer demand ahead of a July 1 emissions regulation change. Now let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Based on our current forecast, we are maintaining full-year 2023 revenue guidance of up 15% to 20% versus last year. EBITDA is still expected to be in the range of 15% to 15.7%. We now expect stronger revenue and profitability in both our Power Systems and Distribution segments than we did three months ago, offset by increased cost in the Accelera business. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 270,000 to 290,000 units in 2023. Supply chain constraints continue to limit our industry's collective ability to produce and while end customer demand remains strong currently, our current guidance forecasts lower industry truck production in the fourth quarter. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are projecting the market size to be 135,000 to 150,000 units, up 5% to 15% from 2022. This is an increase from our previous guidance by 10,000 units. Similar to heavy-duty, supply chain constraints continue to limit our ability to produce and fully meet end customer demand. However, through the rebalancing across our global plant efforts to improve the supply base, we have been able to increase our production, resulting in the improved outlook. The improvement in the medium-duty outlook was offset by decreases in our forecast for two other markets. North America construction is now expected to be down 10% to flat versus our previous guidance of flat to up 10%. Secondly, Brazil truck is expected to be down 30% to 40%, a decline from our prior guidance of down 10% to 20% as the market adjusts to Euro 6 equivalent emission standards. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be $140,000 to $150,000 in 2023. Volume levels in line with 2022. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase approximately 15% in 2023, driven by share growth, better volumes and content increases. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 10% to 20% improvement in the light-duty truck demand coming off the low market levels in 2022, consistent with prior guidance. Despite the slow pace of recovery in the China truck market, we are continuing to see strong performance for our products, including the 15-liter natural gas engine, which we launched in 2021. Due to the fuel cost differential, approximately 20% of the heavy-duty market is expected to be natural gas powered by the end of 2023. In the short time since we launched our new natural gas product in China, our share has been ramping up with strong customer reception in the heavy-duty market, and we look forward to launching the 15-liter natural gas engine in North America in 2024. We expect China construction volumes to be flat to down 10%, in line with prior guidance, consistent with the tepid economy and weaker overall activity. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up approximately 6% in 2023, an improvement from our previous forecast of about 1%, propelled by stronger power generation and on-highway sales. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horse power markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales of mining engines are expected to be flat to up 10%, an improvement from our previous guidance of down 5% to up 5%. Revenues in global power generation markets are now expected to increase 15% to 20%, up from our previous guidance of a 10% to 15% increase, driven by non-residential construction and improvement in the data center markets. For Accelera, we expect full-year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, consistent with our previous guidance. As noted in my highlights, the electrolyzer market continues to gain momentum with our near-term focus on expanding capacity to meet the growing demand. As we scale up to serve the electrolyzer opportunity, continue to develop our products and support our customers in the field, costs are running higher than originally projected for the year. As a result, we have revised our EBITDA guidance for Accelera to an expected loss of $420 million to $440 million for 2023 versus our prior guidance of $370 million to $390 million. Within components, Cummins expects revenues contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, and EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% of sales, consistent with prior guidance. In summary, coming off a very strong first half where we produced record revenues and record EBITDA while delivering for our customers, we are maintaining our guidance of sales up 15% to 20% and EBITDA of 15% to 15.7%. Demand in most of our core markets is strong, while we continue to closely monitor global economic indicators. Should economic momentum slow, Cummins will remain in a strong position to keep investing in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our shareholders. Our guidance for the full-year implies weaker revenue in the second half of the year. While demand remained strong in several markets, a weaker outlook in China versus the first half, an expected decrease in the North American heavy-duty truck production in the fourth quarter and the previously mentioned North America construction and Brazil truck decrease are some of the factors driving the lower second half run rate. In view of the lowered forecasted revenues in the second half of the year, we expect to manage our operating expenses below the second quarter levels. During the quarter, we returned $223 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders. Shortly after quarter end, we announced a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.57 to $1.68 per share, the 14th consecutive year in which we have increased the dividend. The strong execution from the first quarter of 2023 continued into the second, resulting in record sales and strong profitability despite the ongoing challenges in our operating environment. I want to thank our Cummins employees who continue to work tirelessly to meet customer needs and respond to the strong demand levels by ensuring quality products, strengthening our customer relationships and navigating continued supply chain constraints. Our results reflect our focus on delivering strong operational performance, investing in future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and returning cash to our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark. And on your second question, Jamie, in terms of what we're seeing in the market, the performance of our products continues to be very positive and strong. And what I would say is my conversations in the \u2013 in recent months have continued to have conversations with customers, in particular in the medium-duty space, and even in the electrolyzer space, there's a lot of demand and interest in Cummins products. And I noted that we've made some shifts in our global plants to increase capacity and medium-duty for North America to meet that demand. So there's still really strong demand in that market. And we're cyclical business. We're used to being a cyclical business, I think this is going to likely be a more gentle cycle across markets than what we've typically seen, but we do see some indications in certain markets, a little bit softening in aftermarket, some anticipated down days and our guidance implies heavy-duty a little bit lower in the fourth quarter, in particular, construction a little bit lower. And China, really not growing significantly, seasonally softer in the second half versus first half. So I still feel quite good about market outlook and how we're performing. And yes, we think the Q2 is going to be our revenue peak and we're \u2013 our guide reflects that and we're taking actions to make sure we're prioritizing the places we need to invest for the future while also managing headcount discretionary spending and just SG&A down for the second half of the year. Yes, great. Thanks, Jerry. Yes, as you noted, I think there's growing interest in what I call some of these bridge technologies, alternate fuels and engines, the natural gas product, we're seeing growth in that in China. We're going to launch that here. We expect to see some success in that market and looking at hydrogen engines where we've \u2013 we're developing those and trying to figure out in which markets they'll play a role. It's slow going because of the infrastructure build out that's required. And so we're really focused on investing to have the right products, but at the right time. And so you're still going to see a lot of demand for diesel in the next few years. One key thing that happened this quarter was progress with the car regulation and the alignment now to EPA in \u201827, which is a real positive. So we could focus on a nationwide solution and then some of these bridge and zero emission solutions to start to adopt and applications and places where the infrastructure exists. Yes. And the thing we've been able to do, we had a lot of supply challenges in that business last year. So through the first half, we've been able to really produce at a better level. And we see strong demand in particular data center demand, the order board is out through next year for the data center market. We revised \u2013 you heard us revise mining up a little bit. So we're seeing strength in parts of those markets. And then as Mark noted, it's a little bit of softening in other parts of that market. But the situation there is really stabilized from where it was last year. No, I mean, the color I'll give there is, we were at incredibly high aftermarket levels because what was happening was customers couldn't buy new trucks. So they were using trucks longer that drove more aftermarket demand. And so it's still very healthy. We believe we've seen some \u2013 we're seeing some inventory adjustment happening. And that the overall aftermarket demand has come down a little bit, but it's still very, very healthy to your point, the aftermarket business for us from our margin perspective is a favorable one, but we still see it being healthy is what I would say. It's a tricky one. And as you can imagine, we are debating this a lot. So as I said, a little bit softer aftermarket is typically an indication that we're going to see some softening in the market more down days in the fourth quarter. There's just uncertainty from an economic perspective and the typical cyclical nature that we see in our markets that is causing us to anticipate in the fourth quarter. And as we look to next year that the market size is going to start to come down a little bit. As I said, I think it's a softer cycle than we would typically see, but it just \u2013 it's at a very high level right now. We \u2013 our Jamestown is producing as much as they can. Yes, look, we're \u2013 our goal is to continue to balance the price with the cost pressure that we've been seeing, which is stabilized. And then we'll launch some new products next year as well. So that will allow us to continue to have those conversations with customers, but really nothing dramatic there. Correct. We don't control the pricing that happens to the end customer. We have long-term agreements and we price our engine and powertrain solutions and options to the OEM. And we typically follow those long-term agreements with metal market adjustments and have done some inflationary adjustments with them over the last few years, but we don't fundamentally dictate that pricing to the end customer. Our goal is to have a product offered to work with the end customers to create goal for our product through the performance of our powertrain compared to others in the market. I was going to say, of course, in the heavy-duty space, a big factor and customer choices as fuel economy. Yes, I don't \u2013 it really hasn't changed notably from the thinking before and that this idea that we're going to see a gentle cycle. So, some downturn in the market, not dramatic and anticipating that, that happening. And it's really dependent on some of these broader economic things and what really happens, how that plays out. But in the meantime, layered on that, what you're seeing is we're improving gross margin across the business, right? The base business gross margin performance has been strong, Meritor has continued to improve quarter-over-quarter. And we think now is the time to start managing our operating costs, expecting that we're going to see some downturn and then continue to look at places as you've seen us do some structural things to improve the business and the focus this year has really been within the Power Systems business where we're doing that. Yes. At this point, we're continuing to assume there's no stimulus. There was, in a meeting, a few weeks ago, well, the \u2013 I think the government recognizes that they want to try to improve the economy. They want to do it and fiscally responsible stable way. And so we're not assuming stimulus. China is playing out pretty much as we anticipated some improvement off of a very low 2022 and typical seasonality between first half and second half. And if there's stimulus that comes in that impacts demand that would impact our outlook as well. Yes. We are still \u2013 with the strategy we have in place right now, we continue to work towards the EBITDA neutral in 2027. A big piece of that is this electrolyzer revenue growth as you saw with the comments on backlog that we continue to be confident in the outlook there and we \u2013 the increased investment this year is really focused on making sure we've got the product and the supply chain right to enable us to do that. Yes. So, our outlook for U.S. construction down to flat, right? So data \u2013 and data centers would show up for us and power generation data center market is definitely strong. There's parts of the market where construction, infrastructure investment and construction remains strong and there's other segments of that market with rising interest rates and that we're seeing things. Yes, it's not a huge factor for us. I mean, the data center factor for us is that they buy these very large gensets for backup power and that drives significant revenue for power systems. The actual construction itself... Yes. Yes. The industry and policy changes drive that optimism and the outlook and the growing demand, the higher cost of shifts, not capital expenses of the plants as much as it is operating costs in engineering and in customer support as we're scaling up that product or running higher than we had previously forecasted. Yes. Here's a \u2013 there's a couple of things that we watch on this, how the market develops. So on the electrolyzer side, there's investments, but the actual details of how that government money flows and when it flows are still being defined. So that is a bit of a timing impact on some of that. And then in the electrified powertrain, there's still a lot of uncertainty beyond the bus market where you've got cities and corporations that have incentives and want to electrify on exactly how that infrastructure is going to build out. So there's regulations that's going to start to drive more of that, but a lot of uncertainty I would say on the exact pace of that. Thank you."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nChris Clulow: Thank you Donna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins\u2019 results for the first quarter of 2023. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we will refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today\u2019s webcast presentations are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our President and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off. Thank you.\nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter. In March, Cummins announced the launch of Accelera by Cummins, a new brand for our New Power business unit. Accelera provides a diverse portfolio of zero emission solutions for many of the world's most vital industries, empowering customers to accelerate their transition to a sustainable future. Coupled with our brand announcement, Accelera shared that it will supply a 90-megawatt PEM electrolyzer system for Varennes Carbon Recycling plant in Quebec, Canada. This will be the largest PEM installation in North America and a key step in advancing the green hydrogen economy. Accelera and Blue Bird also announced, we will increase production of electric school buses more than doubling the zero emission school buses that we've collectively put into operation over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, progress continues to be made on the planned separation of the filtration business. In February, we announced that our filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed underwritten IPO of newly issued common stock. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America, before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products continue to be strong across all of our key markets and regions with a slow improvement in China, resulting in record revenues in the first quarter of 2023. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.5 billion, an increase of 32% compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor, strong demand, and improved pricing. EBITDA was a record $1.4 billion or 16.1% compared to $755 million or 11.8% a year ago. First quarter 2023 results include $18 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business, while the first quarter of 2022 results include $158 million related to the suspension of operations in Russia, and $17 million related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding these costs, EBITDA percentage increased in the first quarter, driven by higher volumes and improved pricing, offset by supply chain and compensation cost increases. Research and development expenses also increased in the first quarter of 2023 as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components, and Accelera segments. Gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2022 as the benefits of higher volume, pricing, and the acquisition of Meritor exceeded the supply chain cost increases. As we noted previously, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023 and we will continue to provide updates on the progress of our value capture initiatives, which will be focused on the portion of the business within our Components segment. In the first quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement with sales of $1.3 billion and EBITDA of 9.4%. The improvement in profitability from the comparable EBITDA margin of 7.2% in 2022 was driven by improved pricing, operational improvements, and cost reduction activities aligned with our value capture initiatives. Our first quarter revenues in North America grew 39% to $5.1 billion, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 76,000 units, up 17% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, up 27% from 2022. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 33,000 units in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 11% from 2022, while our unit sales were 30, 000, up 13% from 2022. We shipped 39,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the first quarter of 2023, down 5% from 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 6% as volumes declined, partially offset by positive net pricing. Revenues for North America power generation increased by 14% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply chain constraints began to ease. Our international revenues increased by 24% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago with the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most markets. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.7 billion, an increase of 16% as on-highway markets began to recover. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 268,000 units, an increase of 2% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were $46,000, an increase of 31% due to increased penetration within our joint venture partners and new product launches to meet NS VI standards. The light-duty market in China was up 2% from 2022 levels at 476,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 36,000 units, an increase of 6%. Industry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 57,000 units, a decrease of 26% from 2022 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to the change in emissions regulations and related adjustments and inventory levels. Our units sold were 9,000 units, a decrease of 8%. The decrease in the excavator market was offset by improved share with the new and expanded customer relationships and first quarter engine sales to replenish inventory levels at construction OEMs. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 28% in the first quarter, primarily driven by a decline in data center activity. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $752 million, an increase of 21% from first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 26%, while our shipments increased 7%. Power generation revenues increased by 30% in the first quarter as economic activity remains strong. In Brazil, our revenues increased 48%, driven by improved demand in most end markets. Now let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. We have raised our forecast for total company revenue in 2023 to be up 15% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of up 12% to 17%. This guidance reflects an improved outlook in North America, including stronger demand for Meritor. We are forecasting higher demand in heavy-duty truck and power systems markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2022. We are increasing our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 270,000 to 290,000 units in 2023 compared with our prior guide of 260,000 to 280,000. While supply chain constraints continue to limit our industry's collective ability to produce, end customer demand remains strong. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 125,000 to 140,000 units, flat to up 10% from 2022. Similar to heavy duty, supply chain constraints continue to limit our ability to produce and fully meet end customer demand. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 in 2023, volume levels consistent with 2022. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 16% in 2023, an improvement from the previous guidance of up 7% driven by share growth better than expected construction volumes and content increase. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 10% to 20% improvement in the demand in the light-duty truck market, coming off the low market levels in 2022, consistent with the prior guide. We expect China construction volume to be flat to down 10%, improved from our prior guidance of a decline of 25% to 30%. While the market is adjusting to new emissions regulations, shipments to replenish inventory and export demand exceed our prior expectations. As we discussed previously, our guidance assumes a slow recovery in demand in China this year. We have continued to improve our presence in the region, through the down cycle of 2022 and are well-positioned for continued outgrowth. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to outgrow the market and support our partners. We are seeing this in 2023 with improved on-highway share now that NSVI is fully implemented, along with higher share in the construction market as we expand our partnerships. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions as our market share increases in the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up 1% in 2023. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales and mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with the prior guidance. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 15% to 25% in 2023, driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10% to 15%, driven by increases in non-residential construction and improvement in the data center market. For Accelera, we are expecting full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, consistent with our prior guidance. Revenues are expected to approximately double from 2022 due to higher battery demand in North America school bus market and the additions of the electronic powertrain portion of the Meritor business and Siemens commercial vehicle business. The electrolyzer market continues to gain momentum as well with the near-term forecast on expanding capacity to meet the growing demand. As mentioned on our previous call, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. Within components, Cummins expects revenue contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be between $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, an increase from $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in our previous guidance. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% of sales, consistent with prior guidance. In summary, coming off a very strong first quarter with visibility to strong demand beyond the first half of the year, we have raised our sales growth outlook for the year to 15% to 20%. We have also revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 15% to 15.7% from our previous guidance of 14.5% to 15.2%, reflecting very strong incremental margins while continue to invest for the future within our core business and Accelera. Demand in most of our core markets is strong. Our products are performing well, and we are excited about the investments we are making in the future. During the quarter, we returned $222 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. Strong execution resulted in record sales, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share in the first quarter, despite the continued challenging operating environment. I'm impressed and grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world who are delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Our excellent results further enhance Cummins' ability to keep investing in future growth, bringing sustainable solutions that will protect the planet for future generations and return cash to our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark.\nMark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter with organic revenue growth of 12%, record quarterly EBITDA, net income and earnings per share, an improved operating cash flow compared to a year ago. Given the strength of the first quarter results and improved outlook, we have raised our full year expectations for sales and profitability. Now, let me go into some more details of the first quarter performance. Revenues were a record $8.5 billion, up 32% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 39% and international revenues increased 24%. Of the total increase, 20% was driven by the addition of Meritor. Organic growth was driven by strong demand for products in all segments and improved pricing. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 2%. EBITDA was a record $1.4 billion or 16.1% of sales for the quarter, including $18 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 was $755 million or 11.8% of sales, including $158 million of costs related to the suspension of our operations in Russia, and $17 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding these items, the higher EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes and improved pricing, partially offset by increased investment in new products and capabilities. To provide clarity on the first quarter operational performance of our business and allow comparison to prior year and guidance and excluding the costs related to the separation of the Filtration business and the suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments. Let's look a little more detail by line item. Gross margin of $2 billion increased $440 million, but as a percent of sales decreased by 90 basis points, as the benefits of higher volumes and improved pricing were offset by the dilutive effect of Meritor. Across our businesses, we saw mixed trends on input costs, with the Engine business experiencing some increases, while other segments saw some benefits in freight and commodity costs. Results for Meritor improved from prior quarters due to improved pricing and operational improvements. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $191 million, driven by the addition of Meritor, higher variable compensation and research costs, as we continue to invest in new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth. Selling, admin and R&D decreased 110 basis points as a percent of sales. Joint venture income of $119 million decreased $8 million from the prior year, with higher earnings from joint ventures operations offset by lower technology fees. In China, we did see higher earnings than anticipated, as truck OEMs increased build rates to restock channels after a very challenging 2022. We not yet seeing signs of sustained improvement in end user demand, however. Other income was $71 million, an increase of $123 million from a year ago. The improvement in other income is driven by a gain of $19 million in mark-to-market investments compared to a loss of $37 million a year ago. We -- also, a year ago, we incurred an asset write-down of $36 million. Interest income and gains on foreign exchange also increased year-over-year in this line item. Interest expense increased by $70 million due to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor and rising interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 21.7%, including $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter were $790 million or $5.55 per diluted share, up 90% from the $418 million or $2.92 per diluted share a year ago. Our strong performance in Q1 continues our trend of raising performance over successive cycles. All-in, operating cash flow was an inflow of $495 million, $331 million higher than the first quarter last year, primarily due to higher earnings. I'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes the impact of Meritor all year and it assumes that the operations of the Filtration business will be included in our consolidated results for the full year. Segment results and guidance exclude the costs or benefits related to the separation of the Filtration business as and when that occurs. Components segment revenue was a record $3.6 billion, an increase of 79%, while EBITDA decreased from 16.4% of sales to 14.6%, primarily driven by the addition of Meritor. Meritor revenues in the first quarter in the segment were $1.3 billion and EBITDA was $120 million or 9.4% of sales, up from last quarter and in line with our expectations. Components, we expect total 2023 revenues to increase between 32% and 37%, up 4% from prior year guidance and EBIT margin to be in the range of 14.1% to 14.8%, unchanged from three months ago. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were a record $3.3 billion, an increase of 8% from a year ago. EBITDA was 15.3%, flat with a year ago as the benefit from pricing was offset by higher material and variable compensation expenses. In 2023, we expect revenues for the Engine business to grow between 2% and 7%, up 2% at the midpoint from our prior guide, driven by continued strength in the North American truck market and a lower pace of deceleration in the China construction market. 2023 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5% of sales, flat with previous guidance. And our overall projections for the Engine business include a modest tapering in both the top line and the bottom line in the fourth quarter. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago to a record $2.4 billion. EBITDA also increased to 13.9% of sales compared to 9.9% a year ago, driven by higher volumes in both whole goods and aftermarket as well as improved net pricing. We expect 2023 distribution revenues to be up 5% to 10% and EBITDA margins in the range of 11.3% to 12%, and we've raised our guidance for sales by 3% at the midpoint and margins by 100 basis points. In the Power Systems business, we also had a strong quarter with the revenues of $1.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. EBITDA increased from 9.5% to 16.3% of sales driven by higher volumes, strong Parts business, and higher pricing. In 2023, we expect revenues to be up 5% to 10% consistent with our prior guidance. EBITDA is projected to be approximately 13.7% to 14.4%, an increase of 70 basis points from our prior projections. Accelera revenues more than doubled to $85 million, driven by higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market, and the additions of the electric powertrain portion of Meritor and Siemens commercial vehicle business. Our EBITDA loss was $94 million as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. In 2023, we anticipate Accelera revenues to increase to the range of $350 million to $400 million and net losses to be in the range of $380 million at the midpoint, entirely consistent with our projections from three months ago. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the outlook in our key regions and end markets, we are raising full year company guidance. We now project 2023 company revenues to be up 15% to 20%, a 3% increase from our prior guidance. Company EBITDA margins are now expected to be approximately 15% to 15.7%, up 50 basis points from our prior projections. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%, 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior forecast. As we continue to make the critical investments necessary to bring to market new products and capacity expansion to support future growth. We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning 50% of operating cash to shareholders over time. And as we said last time, in 2023, our primary focus will be on dividends and strengthening our balance sheet by reducing debt for this year, whilst we continue to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. In summary, we delivered record sales, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share in a very strong first quarter. Our customers are indicating stronger visibility into the second half of the year, giving us confidence to raise our forecast. We will continue to focus on delivering strong incremental margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, reducing inventory levels and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in the adoption of new technologies. There is one last matter I would like to bring to your attention. You will see in our Form 10-Q to be filed later today that we have updated our risk factor disclosure related to our ongoing discussions with the EPA and CARB on their review of our emission systems, most notably our pickup truck applications. We understand that these agencies are likely to propose resolving this matter by requesting in the relatively near future that we agree to one or more consent decrees and pay certain civil penalties. We are not able to estimate the amount of these penalties today, but we anticipate that the amount is likely to be material. We look forward to providing additional information on this topic when we reach a resolution. Thank you for joining us today, and now I'll turn it back over to Chris.\nChris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Out of consideration to others on the call, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and a related follow-up. If you have any additional questions, please rejoin the queue. Operator, we are ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. The first question today is coming from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone.\nJennifer Rumsey: Good morning, Jerry.\nMark Smith: Good morning, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Congratulations on a really strong quarter. I just wanted to ask for the Power Systems and Distribution businesses, outstanding first quarter, the guidance is for margins to decline significantly off of the first quarter run rate. Can you just step through? Is that just early in the year, and we want to make sure the results are sustainable, or are there any discrete items that you think declined sequentially for these two businesses?\nMark Smith: Yes, we've definitely been asking those questions internally as well, Jerry. Really strong results from both. I think pricing, of course, has been positive. I think in both those businesses, we haven't yet seen some of the cost increases that we anticipated for the full year. We had some beneficial moves in commodities that help power systems. So we're not assuming that they continue. And then in distribution, of course, very strong parts margins, and some lag effect before some of the cost increases take place. So we're still expecting strong full year results. Of course, we'll continue to push for improvement everywhere we can. And again, there was modest benefits from one or two corporate items that improved all of the segments. But I think the main takeaway I want you to leave with, we're really pleased with the performance in particular of those businesses. The Distribution business now has established quite a track record of improving margins over time, and we're really encouraged over the last three or four quarters by the progress in the Power Systems business. So we'll keep pushing for more. But I think one or two factors that we're not certain can continue through the subsequent quarters. And we are trying to drive down inventory a little bit, which may have some absorption impact in the Power Systems business a little.\nJerry Revich: Super. Thank you, Mark. And then can I just shift gears, Jennifer, you folks do a really good job of expanding your market share every time we have new regulations. I'm wondering can you just expand on the comments that you folks made in the prepared remarks and just talk about the opportunities that you folks have in terms of potential market share gains as we do see rising content and rising complexity on these engines, particularly within the context of the EPA's electric vehicle plans laid out recently as well? Thanks.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great. Thanks for the question, Jerry. So as I commented and you saw start to come through in Q1, our pattern of leveraging emissions regulation change to drive outgrowth in market position as well as added content is playing out in China now following the launch of the NSVI. We've seen that playing out in India with BSVI regulation previously. And we do believe that there's continued opportunity both in the Engine space with future EPA regulations of the ultra-low NOx build rule to -- to some degree, increase our position in the market, although, of course, we have a strong position today in the US market. So content expansion. So that continues to be a tailwind and outgrowth opportunity slowing to some degree in North America on-highway, but there continues to be upside there. And then we are working clearly in our Accelera business to establish position in the electrified powertrain and in particular, our position in key components and as well as integrated powertrain. So batteries, power electronics and motor generators, eAxles, fuel cells. We feel like we've got the right portfolio of technologies and are forming partnerships and getting experience in the market to position ourselves over time as that market starts to electrify.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Tim Thein of Citi. Please, go ahead.\nTim Thein: Thank you. Good morning. Mark, maybe just one on -- to start on the Engine segment. You've taken up the full year revenue outlook and as well as JV income and the margin guidance, I believe, was unchanged. So what's working against the top line there in terms of the profit or the EBITDA guidance?\nMark Smith: Yes. In the near term, that's the one segment where we've actually faced more pressure on the cost front, on input cost inflation. We made quite a bit of progress in some of the other areas. So that's probably the biggest single factor in there. The JV income, we're not sure we've got -- found a footing in the market yet, Tim, it was better than we expected in Q1. It wasn't exceptional. It was just better than we expected. But we're just not -- we don't have a clear sight into the improving end user demand. I mean, eventually, that will pick up and that will be an upside. We just don't have visibility to it right now. But basically, that's the one business that's still wrestling with -- I wouldn't say the other businesses don't have challenges, but that's the one that continues to have some challenges on the supply side, and that's the biggest factor.\nTim Thein: Got it. Okay. And then, just on -- wouldn't be a Cummins call without an update on China. And you mentioned that on the on-highway side, you've seen a pickup from a production standpoint is not translating yet on the retail side. What just -- what is the team seeing and hearing, not just on the on-highway, but maybe some of the other key end markets for you. You mentioned excavators, but maybe some of the other ones in China and just kind of what's baked in into the balance of the year for the China operations as a whole? Thank you.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, I'll start and then Mark can add additional points that he'd like to. But as you -- as Mark alluded to, in the on-highway business, we're forecasting and believe we're seeing a slow recovery in the market and that there was some inventory buildup in the quarter, not significant increase in end user demand to slow recovery and opportunity outgrowth as we've already talked about. In off-highway, in construction, we have the emissions changeover that is negatively impacting the China market, less so than our previous guide, because we've seen again, some stocking up in the channel as well as higher export demand. We continue to see markets holding up in mining and oil and gas. And so, overall, a little bit of upside in on-highway kind of a mixed story and off-highway construction and power gen.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead.\nJamie Cook: Hi. Good morning and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess, Mark, first question, similar to engines, on components too were increasing our sales guidance marginally, but the margins are unchanged. So what would be the reason behind that? And then, Jen, I guess, based on what you're saying, it sounds like you're seeing fairly good demand trends everywhere in your order book, is pretty good for 2023. But are there any areas where you're sort of seeing red flags? And in the event of a recession or downturn, how do we think about decrementals, or is there any other self-help that Cummins could do to sustain higher earnings, assuming the macro weakens? Thank you.\nMark Smith: Yes. I think, Jamie, I think components continues to do well. The main factor is just really the mix in the business. The underlying businesses are performing well. Again, not such a big help from price/cost in this segment relative to power systems and components. But I think really it's really some minor changes in the mix going forward. We've obviously got strong North America. Meritor continues to improve, but it's still dilutive to that overall segment, but no fundamental .\nJennifer Rumsey: And I'll just add, I mean, from a margin performance perspective, we're really focused on improving the Meritor business performance consistent with what we said when we did the acquisition, driving the incremental margin improvement across our other core businesses and then scaling up investing in a sustainable way and moving towards breakeven and Accelera business. And so we're paying attention to those -- each of those items to track that we're driving towards our targets. In terms of the broader picture, Jamie, to your question, the end market demand, order boards, our customers have, the comments that we continue to get from end customers remains fairly strong. Our confidence, as we said, is growing into the second half of the year, and we continue to watch these broader macroeconomic indicators and understand that we're in a cyclical business. And while this hasn't been a typical cycle because of the supply constraints, we are preparing and we'll take action to deliver decremental margins and outperform through the down cycle as we have in the past. So, already this year, we are making investments in key areas for our future, but also limiting investment in headcount growth in other areas and continue to monitor plant operations and operate at the level appropriate for the demand that we're seeing, and we'll continue to watch that closely and adjust as we need to.\nJamie Cook: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from David Raso of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Raso: Hi. Sort of picking up on trying to look beyond 2023. I'm just curious, the conversations you're having with your off-highway customers for initial thoughts on what they need from you in 2024 relative to on-highway. Just curious if you have any distinguishing features between those different conversations?\nMark Smith: David, is in the construction area or more in the high horsepower markets just to make sure we're answering your question correctly?\nDavid Raso: Open question on purpose. Off-highway versus on-highway.\nMark Smith: Yes. So I would say on the -- we don't really have -- we haven't given guidance, of course, for 2024. We haven't seen any weakening in the construction markets in North America similar to what we're seeing in on-highway, though we're watching this one closely. I think it's probably a very similar state as we look at construction versus on-highway, cautious probably as we move into the fourth quarter, but good visibility now that that's probably going into the -- well into the third quarter now.\nJennifer Rumsey: And I'll just add, of course, in China, you talked about the emissions changeover. So, there's a dynamic in that market and a question on does China do any action in the economy there that we'll pay attention to. And in Power Systems, same in terms of broader macroeconomic indicators I'm watching that, but we do have places where we're starting to take orders into 2024. And so it's a space that we're just watching closely at this point.\nDavid Raso: I appreciate that. And people also are just curious about truck historically hasn't been the best market for maintaining price. But it's also been a pretty unique pricing power era we're living through right now. So, I'm just curious how are you thinking about or what are the early conversations like for 2024. I'm not saying if you have to give back price, there can't be commensurate offset and lower cost for you. But just trying to think about pricing in isolation, what are the initial conversations for 2024 given the pricing levels where we've been coming up to the last 12, 18 months?\nJennifer Rumsey: Well, we have emissions change overcoming in some of our markets in 2024. So, of course, that's a factor. But what I would say is we have long-term agreements with some of our customers. We price more regularly with some other customers in the market. We're continuing to pay attention to what's going on with price costs. As Mark said, it's still a mixed picture. And so we're committed to continuing to deliver strong returns and stay on top of price cost as that moves. But right now, this year, we're seeing improvements in some areas, and we're still seeing inflationary pressure and other areas. So it's a little bit difficult in -- 2024, yeah.\nDavid Raso: But for price -- I'm just curious, any price concessions. When we hear some component suppliers, or I mean they were even being asked for concessions mid-year because I guess the answer would be why not if you're the OEM. But I'm just curious more structural for 2024. Is -- are we getting some price concession request? Should that be a base case and then it's about getting the cost down even more ideally?\nMark Smith: I think there a lot of factors go into pricing, David, included in input costs, agreements with customers, supplier available. A lot of those things, but that's not a main topic conversation right now at all. I think the thing we're most thinking about is the -- how long does this cycle run on and off-highway and right now, customers are telling us their confidence for the rest of the year is, on average, has gone up, not stayed the same. We recognize and appreciate the same questions really about demand levels for 2024. That's our radar is mostly upon any signals around demand. That's going to be the biggest driving factor of our performance.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Almost just following up on that question with maybe a slightly different plant. Your businesses where you, I think, have more pricing control and distribution power systems did really well at margin. And the OEMs that you serve and on-highway truck have had a really good quarter as well. Just overall, is your general sense that you're pricing to those OEMs and components should catch up over time, and there's still your runway to go, or is that too strong?\nMark Smith: Well, first of all, we can't really -- we can't -- we're not aware of all the dynamics of the OEM pricing. That's really their business. We really have to look at the costs and the performance of our business. The other thing that's going on within our margins, of course, quite significant investment, we've got a lot of new products that we're excited about, and some of our customers are excited about. So the engineering cost of elevated. So that is the other factor that's really particularly in the engine components. I'm going to accelerate everything new and doesn't come with an enormous amount of revenue today. But in the engines and components, we have secured more business for the future, right? And we're planning to secure even more with the new technologies that we're bringing forward. We're price cost positive for this year. That's clearly a factor in our results, so where we can get pricing, we will do that. Aftermarket, there's obviously a stronger source of pricing for us generally, Rob. But I think looking at the margins, you've got to take into effect, how much are we investing? Because I think how much others are investing is also a signal about who's investing for more growth. And right now, we are putting more into the engineering across the business because we're excited about the future.\nRob Wertheimer: That's a helpful answer. Thank you. And if I can -- I think I've asked this before, I am not \u2013 easy to answer, but in Accelera, how should we think about as revenue start to ramp, what margins do? I mean are project level economics going to be consistently positive on the margin line and maybe not more be. Are you still bidding loss-making deliveries as your volumes to come through? How do we sort of think about what the underlying dynamics are of the margin there?\nMark Smith: I think there have been some higher fixed costs on the battery electric side. And then on electrolyzers, we are going to expect to have positive gross margins as we ramp up. And then we've stated previously that based on our current strategy, we're aiming to get at or around EBITDA neutral by 2027. So yes, as revenues go up, we're going to expect to see those losses clearly come down over time. And we've got -- we're building momentum on the sales, particularly yesterday, the Q1, most of the sales growth was on battery electric, excuse me. But as we've talked about recently, the electrolyzer backlog is really -- I won't use the word accelerate, has picked up quite a lot. And so we're bullish about that. But yes, very focused on the margins as the volumes come up. Battery is a little bit higher fixed cost rate.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Tami Zakaria of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Ishan [ph] on behalf of Tami. Congratulations on the great print. My first question is, are you preparing to ramp production assuming 2025 or 2026 could be pre-buy years ahead of the emission regulations in 2027? And then if I may ask a second on -- sorry, if I may ask a second on Meritor as well. Are you able to pass on cost inflation as anticipated, or are customers pushing back? Thanks.\nMark Smith: Yes. So what I'd say is we are making planned investments because we're -- irrespective of the economic cycle, we're expecting to pick up more business. So we're increasing capacity in parts of our business and launching new products. The nature of our business is such that we have to be prepared to ramp up and ramp down based on the economic cycle. So it's hard to predict with great certainty two or three years out. But as a general statement, yes, our CapEx is up this year because we're kind of bullish on our longer-term prospects. And then on pricing cost, of course, it's always competitive and challenging. But I think we're all aware that there's been significant inflation across the industrial space over time, and that's what's really necessitated the price increases and quite frankly, earlier on in the cycle late in 2021. It took us a while before we were able to increase prices. So to an extent, we've been kind of catching up with the trends there. Yes, so that's an ongoing\u2026\nJennifer Rumsey: You saw some of that as Meritor specifically reflected in the EBITDA improvement.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Steven Fisher of UBS. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fisher: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Wanted to just follow up, if I could, on the EPA and CARB legal situation that you mentioned, if there's any color on the potential timing of resolution that you can offer? And then I know this is obviously sensitive and I suspect you don't want to negotiate with yourself on a conference call, but just how to think about framing the size of what this might be? Is this something that might be in sort of the multi-hundreds of millions of dollars? Is this something that you could fund within your just ongoing cash flow and might it affect any other investment plans or spending plans that you might have?\nJennifer Rumsey: So, first, thanks for the question. I do want to start by saying that Cummins is fully committed to emissions compliance. We have been and we'll continue to cooperate with agencies all along and work through this matter to the best of our abilities. And our updated disclosure today is consistent with what we've done since we first announced our voluntary internal review in 2019 of disclosing transparently throughout this process. So, as Mark said, we think that we are nearing the end. It's premature to speculate though exact timing or exact amount at this point. We feel like the business is well positioned in a strong financial position and continuing to generate strong returns.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I'm wondering, just to follow up on some of the price versus cost discussions. Are you able to actually quantify the price versus cost kind of cadence for this year and sort of the margin cadence for the rest of the year? And I'm thinking about the whole company, but if it makes sense to talk about highlight any specific segments, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nMark Smith: Well, in first quarter, we were about 2% net positive between price and cost. And as we said on the -- in the earlier remarks, it very much varied by business. And in fact, you can see it, since you're asking a lot of questions about the different margins in the business, you can see that. I mean, the pricing is pretty much set. Aftermarket is one area where we have the potential that were just prices more frequently. That's the nature of the aftermarket business. I don't think that's unique to Cummins. But pretty much, I think, the course is largely set for this year and then, it's really looking for efficiencies in every part of operations, working with customers, working with suppliers. We all enjoy it when the costs are lower. That's just not where we'd be. It's been an unprecedented period of supply constrains, some of which, frankly, we're not out of yet and it's been a period of unprecedented complexity and very, very robust demand. And we've continued to grow our business faster than some of the underlying markets. So that's been a positive, but that\u2019s been a lot of work for our supply chain teams. But I think, largely, it's going to be a net positive for this year, Steve. I don't imagine dramatic changes quarter-to-quarter. The commodities can ebb and flow a little bit, and we saw some benefit copper prices in the Power Systems business. And again, we're using hedging and other techniques to try and smooth out those costs. But I don't expect fundamental changes to the reason for variation in earnings. We're really focused on this demand side. And right now, our confidence has gone up based on the confidence of our customers through the rest of this year.\nJennifer Rumsey: And just to keep in mind as context here. Over the last couple of years, as we saw that rapid increase in demand, there's really been two factors at play with the inflationary pressure and supply challenges. So one is cost versus our ability to pass that on a price, and we made a lot of progress through 2022, and you see that continue in 2023 to offset the inflationary pressure and then it's operating leverage. And because of all the supply disruptions we didn't see in those early quarters, the normal operating leverage that we would, and that has also improved and is reflected in some of the numbers that you see in Q1. So just to give you a sense of what that's like for us now in our Rocky Mount Engine Plant, which produces midrange engines. Last year, our on-time delivery from our suppliers was at 60%. In Q1, it was at 70%. And historically, we would expect something closer to 80%. And so that plays out in operating efficiency for us in our plant. So, it's improved. There's still a little bit of opportunity. But running at the rate that we are, we are continuing to be constrained by a couple of our supplier components. I'm shocked we've made it this far into the call without asking -- anybody asking me about supply chain. Yes, chips and electronics have improved, but they're still operating at capacity, which means small disruption hasn't impacted. But overall, underlying operating leverage has improved.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Matt Elkott of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Elkott: Good morning. Thank you On the rail side, wondering if you see any potential long-term content opportunities from the new locomotive rule that California issued on Thursday, which includes mandates on freight, passenger, and industrial locomotives. So, if it stands and goes national, there could be a big build cycle as well as a lot of new technology upgrades. Is there any opportunity for you guys from that?\nJennifer Rumsey: It's still early for me to add a lot of response here. We, of course, now are in the passenger rail business with our 95-liter engine. We have a Tier 4 compliant product, and then we've also entered the rail market with certain customers with fuel cells. And so we'll continue to explore opportunities with the product offerings that we have in that market.\nMatt Elkott: Got it. And just one higher level question in light of your strong results and improved outlook. Do you see this bifurcation between your strength and the strength of the machinery sector as a whole on one hand and the rest of the economy being weak? Is that nearly a function of just catching up the demand from the last two and a half years or so while disruptions hampered production levels, or is this -- you mentioned, Jen, that this is not a typical cycle. Is there something more than that, more than just catching up the demand?\nJennifer Rumsey: Well, there is -- I mean, definitely, what you said is a factor, limitations in supply and high use, right, at high use and then new products are more fuel efficient. So, there's still a lot of factors that are causing customers to -- in commercial trucking to continue to want to buy. There's investments in infrastructure that's driving demand and construction and there's growing investments in the cloud, it's driving data center demand. And so there are some specific indicators for our business that maybe are decoupled from the broader economy. That said, the broader economy does have some influence, which is why we continue to be cautious about where we're making investments and increasing headcount.\nMark Smith: We do -- just like you as an observer of other parts of the economy and sometimes wonder at the rate of hiring and resources being added into new areas, and then you get retrenchment. And sometimes, that's very different from the business model that we operate in. We work with very efficient customers. A lot of efficiency is the focus, right, even when some growing are going through strong cycles in other sectors of the economy, you see some very different dynamics that just don't translate well to what we have experienced.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, we have run out of time for questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Clulow for closing comments.\nChris Clulow: Thanks very much, Donna. Before we conclude, I want to turn it back over to Jennifer for a few closing comments.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Just to wrap up today, I want to again recognize the strong performance of the company in the first quarter, delivering record revenue, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share. We're in a strong financial position and are confident in our strategy and our leaders in the future of the company and look forward to continuing to update you on our progress in future calls.\nChris Clulow: Thank you. That concludes our teleconference for today, and thank you all for participating and your continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time or log off the webcast, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Mark Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong first quarter with organic revenue growth of 12%, record quarterly EBITDA, net income and earnings per share, an improved operating cash flow compared to a year ago. Given the strength of the first quarter results and improved outlook, we have raised our full year expectations for sales and profitability. Now, let me go into some more details of the first quarter performance. Revenues were a record $8.5 billion, up 32% from a year ago. Sales in North America increased 39% and international revenues increased 24%. Of the total increase, 20% was driven by the addition of Meritor. Organic growth was driven by strong demand for products in all segments and improved pricing. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 2%. EBITDA was a record $1.4 billion or 16.1% of sales for the quarter, including $18 million of costs related to the planned separation of the Filtration business. EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 was $755 million or 11.8% of sales, including $158 million of costs related to the suspension of our operations in Russia, and $17 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding these items, the higher EBITDA percent was driven by higher volumes and improved pricing, partially offset by increased investment in new products and capabilities. To provide clarity on the first quarter operational performance of our business and allow comparison to prior year and guidance and excluding the costs related to the separation of the Filtration business and the suspension of our operations in Russia in my following comments. Let's look a little more detail by line item. Gross margin of $2 billion increased $440 million, but as a percent of sales decreased by 90 basis points, as the benefits of higher volumes and improved pricing were offset by the dilutive effect of Meritor. Across our businesses, we saw mixed trends on input costs, with the Engine business experiencing some increases, while other segments saw some benefits in freight and commodity costs. Results for Meritor improved from prior quarters due to improved pricing and operational improvements. Selling, admin and research expenses increased by $191 million, driven by the addition of Meritor, higher variable compensation and research costs, as we continue to invest in new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth. Selling, admin and R&D decreased 110 basis points as a percent of sales. Joint venture income of $119 million decreased $8 million from the prior year, with higher earnings from joint ventures operations offset by lower technology fees. In China, we did see higher earnings than anticipated, as truck OEMs increased build rates to restock channels after a very challenging 2022. We not yet seeing signs of sustained improvement in end user demand, however. Other income was $71 million, an increase of $123 million from a year ago. The improvement in other income is driven by a gain of $19 million in mark-to-market investments compared to a loss of $37 million a year ago. We -- also, a year ago, we incurred an asset write-down of $36 million. Interest income and gains on foreign exchange also increased year-over-year in this line item. Interest expense increased by $70 million due to financing costs related to the acquisition of Meritor and rising interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 21.7%, including $3 million or $0.02 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All-in net earnings for the quarter were $790 million or $5.55 per diluted share, up 90% from the $418 million or $2.92 per diluted share a year ago. Our strong performance in Q1 continues our trend of raising performance over successive cycles. All-in, operating cash flow was an inflow of $495 million, $331 million higher than the first quarter last year, primarily due to higher earnings. I'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, 2023 guidance includes the impact of Meritor all year and it assumes that the operations of the Filtration business will be included in our consolidated results for the full year. Segment results and guidance exclude the costs or benefits related to the separation of the Filtration business as and when that occurs. Components segment revenue was a record $3.6 billion, an increase of 79%, while EBITDA decreased from 16.4% of sales to 14.6%, primarily driven by the addition of Meritor. Meritor revenues in the first quarter in the segment were $1.3 billion and EBITDA was $120 million or 9.4% of sales, up from last quarter and in line with our expectations. Components, we expect total 2023 revenues to increase between 32% and 37%, up 4% from prior year guidance and EBIT margin to be in the range of 14.1% to 14.8%, unchanged from three months ago. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were a record $3.3 billion, an increase of 8% from a year ago. EBITDA was 15.3%, flat with a year ago as the benefit from pricing was offset by higher material and variable compensation expenses. In 2023, we expect revenues for the Engine business to grow between 2% and 7%, up 2% at the midpoint from our prior guide, driven by continued strength in the North American truck market and a lower pace of deceleration in the China construction market. 2023 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 13.8% to 14.5% of sales, flat with previous guidance. And our overall projections for the Engine business include a modest tapering in both the top line and the bottom line in the fourth quarter. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 14% from a year ago to a record $2.4 billion. EBITDA also increased to 13.9% of sales compared to 9.9% a year ago, driven by higher volumes in both whole goods and aftermarket as well as improved net pricing. We expect 2023 distribution revenues to be up 5% to 10% and EBITDA margins in the range of 11.3% to 12%, and we've raised our guidance for sales by 3% at the midpoint and margins by 100 basis points. In the Power Systems business, we also had a strong quarter with the revenues of $1.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. EBITDA increased from 9.5% to 16.3% of sales driven by higher volumes, strong Parts business, and higher pricing. In 2023, we expect revenues to be up 5% to 10% consistent with our prior guidance. EBITDA is projected to be approximately 13.7% to 14.4%, an increase of 70 basis points from our prior projections. Accelera revenues more than doubled to $85 million, driven by higher demand for battery electric systems in the North American school bus market, and the additions of the electric powertrain portion of Meritor and Siemens commercial vehicle business. Our EBITDA loss was $94 million as we continue to invest in the products, infrastructure and capabilities to support strong future growth. In 2023, we anticipate Accelera revenues to increase to the range of $350 million to $400 million and net losses to be in the range of $380 million at the midpoint, entirely consistent with our projections from three months ago. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the outlook in our key regions and end markets, we are raising full year company guidance. We now project 2023 company revenues to be up 15% to 20%, a 3% increase from our prior guidance. Company EBITDA margins are now expected to be approximately 15% to 15.7%, up 50 basis points from our prior projections. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%, 22% in 2023, excluding any discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior forecast. As we continue to make the critical investments necessary to bring to market new products and capacity expansion to support future growth. We remain committed to our long-term goal of returning 50% of operating cash to shareholders over time. And as we said last time, in 2023, our primary focus will be on dividends and strengthening our balance sheet by reducing debt for this year, whilst we continue to deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. In summary, we delivered record sales, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share in a very strong first quarter. Our customers are indicating stronger visibility into the second half of the year, giving us confidence to raise our forecast. We will continue to focus on delivering strong incremental margins in our core business, driving improvements in the performance of Meritor, reducing inventory levels and investing in the products and technologies that position us to lead in the adoption of new technologies. There is one last matter I would like to bring to your attention. You will see in our Form 10-Q to be filed later today that we have updated our risk factor disclosure related to our ongoing discussions with the EPA and CARB on their review of our emission systems, most notably our pickup truck applications. We understand that these agencies are likely to propose resolving this matter by requesting in the relatively near future that we agree to one or more consent decrees and pay certain civil penalties. We are not able to estimate the amount of these penalties today, but we anticipate that the amount is likely to be material. We look forward to providing additional information on this topic when we reach a resolution. Thank you for joining us today, and now I'll turn it back over to Chris. Good morning, Jerry. Yes, we've definitely been asking those questions internally as well, Jerry. Really strong results from both. I think pricing, of course, has been positive. I think in both those businesses, we haven't yet seen some of the cost increases that we anticipated for the full year. We had some beneficial moves in commodities that help power systems. So we're not assuming that they continue. And then in distribution, of course, very strong parts margins, and some lag effect before some of the cost increases take place. So we're still expecting strong full year results. Of course, we'll continue to push for improvement everywhere we can. And again, there was modest benefits from one or two corporate items that improved all of the segments. But I think the main takeaway I want you to leave with, we're really pleased with the performance in particular of those businesses. The Distribution business now has established quite a track record of improving margins over time, and we're really encouraged over the last three or four quarters by the progress in the Power Systems business. So we'll keep pushing for more. But I think one or two factors that we're not certain can continue through the subsequent quarters. And we are trying to drive down inventory a little bit, which may have some absorption impact in the Power Systems business a little. Yes. In the near term, that's the one segment where we've actually faced more pressure on the cost front, on input cost inflation. We made quite a bit of progress in some of the other areas. So that's probably the biggest single factor in there. The JV income, we're not sure we've got -- found a footing in the market yet, Tim, it was better than we expected in Q1. It wasn't exceptional. It was just better than we expected. But we're just not -- we don't have a clear sight into the improving end user demand. I mean, eventually, that will pick up and that will be an upside. We just don't have visibility to it right now. But basically, that's the one business that's still wrestling with -- I wouldn't say the other businesses don't have challenges, but that's the one that continues to have some challenges on the supply side, and that's the biggest factor. Yes. I think, Jamie, I think components continues to do well. The main factor is just really the mix in the business. The underlying businesses are performing well. Again, not such a big help from price/cost in this segment relative to power systems and components. But I think really it's really some minor changes in the mix going forward. We've obviously got strong North America. Meritor continues to improve, but it's still dilutive to that overall segment, but no fundamental . David, is in the construction area or more in the high horsepower markets just to make sure we're answering your question correctly? Yes. So I would say on the -- we don't really have -- we haven't given guidance, of course, for 2024. We haven't seen any weakening in the construction markets in North America similar to what we're seeing in on-highway, though we're watching this one closely. I think it's probably a very similar state as we look at construction versus on-highway, cautious probably as we move into the fourth quarter, but good visibility now that that's probably going into the -- well into the third quarter now. I think there a lot of factors go into pricing, David, included in input costs, agreements with customers, supplier available. A lot of those things, but that's not a main topic conversation right now at all. I think the thing we're most thinking about is the -- how long does this cycle run on and off-highway and right now, customers are telling us their confidence for the rest of the year is, on average, has gone up, not stayed the same. We recognize and appreciate the same questions really about demand levels for 2024. That's our radar is mostly upon any signals around demand. That's going to be the biggest driving factor of our performance. Well, first of all, we can't really -- we can't -- we're not aware of all the dynamics of the OEM pricing. That's really their business. We really have to look at the costs and the performance of our business. The other thing that's going on within our margins, of course, quite significant investment, we've got a lot of new products that we're excited about, and some of our customers are excited about. So the engineering cost of elevated. So that is the other factor that's really particularly in the engine components. I'm going to accelerate everything new and doesn't come with an enormous amount of revenue today. But in the engines and components, we have secured more business for the future, right? And we're planning to secure even more with the new technologies that we're bringing forward. We're price cost positive for this year. That's clearly a factor in our results, so where we can get pricing, we will do that. Aftermarket, there's obviously a stronger source of pricing for us generally, Rob. But I think looking at the margins, you've got to take into effect, how much are we investing? Because I think how much others are investing is also a signal about who's investing for more growth. And right now, we are putting more into the engineering across the business because we're excited about the future. I think there have been some higher fixed costs on the battery electric side. And then on electrolyzers, we are going to expect to have positive gross margins as we ramp up. And then we've stated previously that based on our current strategy, we're aiming to get at or around EBITDA neutral by 2027. So yes, as revenues go up, we're going to expect to see those losses clearly come down over time. And we've got -- we're building momentum on the sales, particularly yesterday, the Q1, most of the sales growth was on battery electric, excuse me. But as we've talked about recently, the electrolyzer backlog is really -- I won't use the word accelerate, has picked up quite a lot. And so we're bullish about that. But yes, very focused on the margins as the volumes come up. Battery is a little bit higher fixed cost rate. Yes. So what I'd say is we are making planned investments because we're -- irrespective of the economic cycle, we're expecting to pick up more business. So we're increasing capacity in parts of our business and launching new products. The nature of our business is such that we have to be prepared to ramp up and ramp down based on the economic cycle. So it's hard to predict with great certainty two or three years out. But as a general statement, yes, our CapEx is up this year because we're kind of bullish on our longer-term prospects. And then on pricing cost, of course, it's always competitive and challenging.

It took us a while before we were able to increase prices. So to an extent, we've been kind of catching up with the trends there. Yes, so that's an ongoing... Well, in first quarter, we were about 2% net positive between price and cost. And as we said on the -- in the earlier remarks, it very much varied by business. And in fact, you can see it, since you're asking a lot of questions about the different margins in the business, you can see that. I mean, the pricing is pretty much set.

It's been an unprecedented period of supply constrains, some of which, frankly, we're not out of yet and it's been a period of unprecedented complexity and very, very robust demand. And we've continued to grow our business faster than some of the underlying markets. So that's been a positive, but that's been a lot of work for our supply chain teams. But I think, largely, it's going to be a net positive for this year, Steve. I don't imagine dramatic changes quarter-to-quarter. The commodities can ebb and flow a little bit, and we saw some benefit copper prices in the Power Systems business. And again, we're using hedging and other techniques to try and smooth out those costs. But I don't expect fundamental changes to the reason for variation in earnings. We're really focused on this demand side. And right now, our confidence has gone up based on the confidence of our customers through the rest of this year. We do -- just like you as an observer of other parts of the economy and sometimes wonder at the rate of hiring and resources being added into new areas, and then you get retrenchment. And sometimes, that's very different from the business model that we operate in. We work with very efficient customers. A lot of efficiency is the focus, right, even when some growing are going through strong cycles in other sectors of the economy, you see some very different dynamics that just don't translate well to what we have experienced."

            "content": "Thank you, Chris. Good morning. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2023. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter. In March, Cummins announced the launch of Accelera by Cummins, a new brand for our New Power business unit. Accelera provides a diverse portfolio of zero emission solutions for many of the world's most vital industries, empowering customers to accelerate their transition to a sustainable future. Coupled with our brand announcement, Accelera shared that it will supply a 90-megawatt PEM electrolyzer system for Varennes Carbon Recycling plant in Quebec, Canada. This will be the largest PEM installation in North America and a key step in advancing the green hydrogen economy. Accelera and Blue Bird also announced, we will increase production of electric school buses more than doubling the zero emission school buses that we've collectively put into operation over the next 12 to 18 months. In addition, progress continues to be made on the planned separation of the filtration business. In February, we announced that our filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed underwritten IPO of newly issued common stock. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2023 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America, before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products continue to be strong across all of our key markets and regions with a slow improvement in China, resulting in record revenues in the first quarter of 2023. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.5 billion, an increase of 32% compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by the addition of Meritor, strong demand, and improved pricing. EBITDA was a record $1.4 billion or 16.1% compared to $755 million or 11.8% a year ago. First quarter 2023 results include $18 million of costs related to the separation of the Filtration business, while the first quarter of 2022 results include $158 million related to the suspension of operations in Russia, and $17 million related to the separation of the Filtration business. Excluding these costs, EBITDA percentage increased in the first quarter, driven by higher volumes and improved pricing, offset by supply chain and compensation cost increases. Research and development expenses also increased in the first quarter of 2023 as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future, particularly in the Engine, Components, and Accelera segments. Gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2022 as the benefits of higher volume, pricing, and the acquisition of Meritor exceeded the supply chain cost increases. As we noted previously, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023 and we will continue to provide updates on the progress of our value capture initiatives, which will be focused on the portion of the business within our Components segment. In the first quarter, Meritor operating performance and financial results showed improvement with sales of $1.3 billion and EBITDA of 9.4%. The improvement in profitability from the comparable EBITDA margin of 7.2% in 2022 was driven by improved pricing, operational improvements, and cost reduction activities aligned with our value capture initiatives. Our first quarter revenues in North America grew 39% to $5.1 billion, driven by the addition of Meritor and strong demand. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 76,000 units, up 17% from 2022 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 29,000, up 27% from 2022. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 33,000 units in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 11% from 2022, while our unit sales were 30, 000, up 13% from 2022. We shipped 39,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the RAM pickups in the first quarter of 2023, down 5% from 2022 levels. Engine sales to construction customers in North America decreased by 6% as volumes declined, partially offset by positive net pricing. Revenues for North America power generation increased by 14% as industrial and data center demand improved and supply chain constraints began to ease. Our international revenues increased by 24% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago with the addition of Meritor and strong demand across most markets. First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.7 billion, an increase of 16% as on-highway markets began to recover. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 268,000 units, an increase of 2% from last year. Our sales and units, including joint ventures, were $46,000, an increase of 31% due to increased penetration within our joint venture partners and new product launches to meet NS VI standards. The light-duty market in China was up 2% from 2022 levels at 476,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 36,000 units, an increase of 6%. Industry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 57,000 units, a decrease of 26% from 2022 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to the change in emissions regulations and related adjustments and inventory levels. Our units sold were 9,000 units, a decrease of 8%. The decrease in the excavator market was offset by improved share with the new and expanded customer relationships and first quarter engine sales to replenish inventory levels at construction OEMs. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 28% in the first quarter, primarily driven by a decline in data center activity. First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures were $752 million, an increase of 21% from first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 26%, while our shipments increased 7%. Power generation revenues increased by 30% in the first quarter as economic activity remains strong. In Brazil, our revenues increased 48%, driven by improved demand in most end markets. Now let me provide our outlook for 2023, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. We have raised our forecast for total company revenue in 2023 to be up 15% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of up 12% to 17%. This guidance reflects an improved outlook in North America, including stronger demand for Meritor. We are forecasting higher demand in heavy-duty truck and power systems markets and expect aftermarket revenues to increase compared with 2022. We are increasing our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 270,000 to 290,000 units in 2023 compared with our prior guide of 260,000 to 280,000. While supply chain constraints continue to limit our industry's collective ability to produce, end customer demand remains strong. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are continuing to project the market size to be 125,000 to 140,000 units, flat to up 10% from 2022. Similar to heavy duty, supply chain constraints continue to limit our ability to produce and fully meet end customer demand. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 140,000 to 150,000 in 2023, volume levels consistent with 2022. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 16% in 2023, an improvement from the previous guidance of up 7% driven by share growth better than expected construction volumes and content increase. We project a 15% to 25% improvement in the heavy and medium-duty truck demand and a 10% to 20% improvement in the demand in the light-duty truck market, coming off the low market levels in 2022, consistent with the prior guide. We expect China construction volume to be flat to down 10%, improved from our prior guidance of a decline of 25% to 30%. While the market is adjusting to new emissions regulations, shipments to replenish inventory and export demand exceed our prior expectations. As we discussed previously, our guidance assumes a slow recovery in demand in China this year. We have continued to improve our presence in the region, through the down cycle of 2022 and are well-positioned for continued outgrowth. Our technological expertise and emissions experience positions us well to outgrow the market and support our partners. We are seeing this in 2023 with improved on-highway share now that NSVI is fully implemented, along with higher share in the construction market as we expand our partnerships. We also continue to ramp production and expand our presence in automated manual transmissions as our market share increases in the heavy-duty market is increasingly adopting this technology. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to be up 1% in 2023. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. We project our major global high horsepower markets to remain strong in 2023. Sales and mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with the prior guidance. Demand for new oil and gas engines is expected to increase by 15% to 25% in 2023, driven by increased demand in North America. Revenues in global power generation markets are expected to increase 10% to 15%, driven by increases in non-residential construction and improvement in the data center market. For Accelera, we are expecting full year sales to be $350 million to $400 million, consistent with our prior guidance. Revenues are expected to approximately double from 2022 due to higher battery demand in North America school bus market and the additions of the electronic powertrain portion of the Meritor business and Siemens commercial vehicle business. The electrolyzer market continues to gain momentum as well with the near-term forecast on expanding capacity to meet the growing demand. As mentioned on our previous call, Meritor results are included in our overall guidance for 2023. Within components, Cummins expects revenue contributed by the Meritor business for 2023 to be between $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion, an increase from $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in our previous guidance. EBITDA is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11% of sales, consistent with prior guidance. In summary, coming off a very strong first quarter with visibility to strong demand beyond the first half of the year, we have raised our sales growth outlook for the year to 15% to 20%. We have also revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 15% to 15.7% from our previous guidance of 14.5% to 15.2%, reflecting very strong incremental margins while continue to invest for the future within our core business and Accelera. Demand in most of our core markets is strong. Our products are performing well, and we are excited about the investments we are making in the future. During the quarter, we returned $222 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. Strong execution resulted in record sales, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share in the first quarter, despite the continued challenging operating environment. I'm impressed and grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world who are delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Our excellent results further enhance Cummins' ability to keep investing in future growth, bringing sustainable solutions that will protect the planet for future generations and return cash to our shareholders. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Good morning, Jerry. Yes. Great. Thanks for the question, Jerry. So as I commented and you saw start to come through in Q1, our pattern of leveraging emissions regulation change to drive outgrowth in market position as well as added content is playing out in China now following the launch of the NSVI. We've seen that playing out in India with BSVI regulation previously. And we do believe that there's continued opportunity both in the Engine space with future EPA regulations of the ultra-low NOx build rule to -- to some degree, increase our position in the market, although, of course, we have a strong position today in the US market. So content expansion. So that continues to be a tailwind and outgrowth opportunity slowing to some degree in North America on-highway, but there continues to be upside there. And then we are working clearly in our Accelera business to establish position in the electrified powertrain and in particular, our position in key components and as well as integrated powertrain. So batteries, power electronics and motor generators, eAxles, fuel cells. We feel like we've got the right portfolio of technologies and are forming partnerships and getting experience in the market to position ourselves over time as that market starts to electrify. Yes, I'll start and then Mark can add additional points that he'd like to. But as you -- as Mark alluded to, in the on-highway business, we're forecasting and believe we're seeing a slow recovery in the market and that there was some inventory buildup in the quarter, not significant increase in end user demand to slow recovery and opportunity outgrowth as we've already talked about. In off-highway, in construction, we have the emissions changeover that is negatively impacting the China market, less so than our previous guide, because we've seen again, some stocking up in the channel as well as higher export demand. We continue to see markets holding up in mining and oil and gas. And so, overall, a little bit of upside in on-highway kind of a mixed story and off-highway construction and power gen. And I'll just add, I mean, from a margin performance perspective, we're really focused on improving the Meritor business performance consistent with what we said when we did the acquisition, driving the incremental margin improvement across our other core businesses and then scaling up investing in a sustainable way and moving towards breakeven and Accelera business. And so we're paying attention to those -- each of those items to track that we're driving towards our targets. In terms of the broader picture, Jamie, to your question, the end market demand, order boards, our customers have, the comments that we continue to get from end customers remains fairly strong. Our confidence, as we said, is growing into the second half of the year, and we continue to watch these broader macroeconomic indicators and understand that we're in a cyclical business. And while this hasn't been a typical cycle because of the supply constraints, we are preparing and we'll take action to deliver decremental margins and outperform through the down cycle as we have in the past. So, already this year, we are making investments in key areas for our future, but also limiting investment in headcount growth in other areas and continue to monitor plant operations and operate at the level appropriate for the demand that we're seeing, and we'll continue to watch that closely and adjust as we need to. And I'll just add, of course, in China, you talked about the emissions changeover. So, there's a dynamic in that market and a question on does China do any action in the economy there that we'll pay attention to. And in Power Systems, same in terms of broader macroeconomic indicators I'm watching that, but we do have places where we're starting to take orders into 2024. And so it's a space that we're just watching closely at this point. Well, we have emissions change overcoming in some of our markets in 2024. So, of course, that's a factor. But what I would say is we have long-term agreements with some of our customers. We price more regularly with some other customers in the market. We're continuing to pay attention to what's going on with price costs. As Mark said, it's still a mixed picture. And so we're committed to continuing to deliver strong returns and stay on top of price cost as that moves. But right now, this year, we're seeing improvements in some areas, and we're still seeing inflationary pressure and other areas. So it's a little bit difficult in -- 2024, yeah. You saw some of that as Meritor specifically reflected in the EBITDA improvement. So, first, thanks for the question. I do want to start by saying that Cummins is fully committed to emissions compliance. We have been and we'll continue to cooperate with agencies all along and work through this matter to the best of our abilities. And our updated disclosure today is consistent with what we've done since we first announced our voluntary internal review in 2019 of disclosing transparently throughout this process. So, as Mark said, we think that we are nearing the end. It's premature to speculate though exact timing or exact amount at this point. We feel like the business is well positioned in a strong financial position and continuing to generate strong returns. And just to keep in mind as context here. Over the last couple of years, as we saw that rapid increase in demand, there's really been two factors at play with the inflationary pressure and supply challenges. So one is cost versus our ability to pass that on a price, and we made a lot of progress through 2022, and you see that continue in 2023 to offset the inflationary pressure and then it's operating leverage. And because of all the supply disruptions we didn't see in those early quarters, the normal operating leverage that we would, and that has also improved and is reflected in some of the numbers that you see in Q1. So just to give you a sense of what that's like for us now in our Rocky Mount Engine Plant, which produces midrange engines. Last year, our on-time delivery from our suppliers was at 60%. In Q1, it was at 70%. And historically, we would expect something closer to 80%. And so that plays out in operating efficiency for us in our plant. So, it's improved. There's still a little bit of opportunity. But running at the rate that we are, we are continuing to be constrained by a couple of our supplier components. I'm shocked we've made it this far into the call without asking -- anybody asking me about supply chain. Yes, chips and electronics have improved, but they're still operating at capacity, which means small disruption hasn't impacted. But overall, underlying operating leverage has improved. It's still early for me to add a lot of response here. We, of course, now are in the passenger rail business with our 95-liter engine. We have a Tier 4 compliant product, and then we've also entered the rail market with certain customers with fuel cells. And so we'll continue to explore opportunities with the product offerings that we have in that market. Well, there is -- I mean, definitely, what you said is a factor, limitations in supply and high use, right, at high use and then new products are more fuel efficient. So, there's still a lot of factors that are causing customers to -- in commercial trucking to continue to want to buy. There's investments in infrastructure that's driving demand and construction and there's growing investments in the cloud, it's driving data center demand. And so there are some specific indicators for our business that maybe are decoupled from the broader economy. That said, the broader economy does have some influence, which is why we continue to be cautious about where we're making investments and increasing headcount. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Just to wrap up today, I want to again recognize the strong performance of the company in the first quarter, delivering record revenue, EBITDA, net income and earnings per share. We're in a strong financial position and are confident in our strategy and our leaders in the future of the company and look forward to continuing to update you on our progress in future calls."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nChristopher Clulow: Thanks, Julian. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the third quarter of 2024. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future. Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. I will now turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off.\nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter accomplishments and financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our financial performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major accomplishments from the third quarter. In September, we started full production of our X15N natural gas engine at our Jamestown Engine plan, which is the first version of our 15-liter helm platform to launch in the U.S. the X15N delivers performance, durability and power required in a variety of applications and is an excellent alternative for fleet looking to significantly reduce their carbon footprint. This is an important milestone in the execution of our Destination Zero strategy as we work to reduce the impact of our products today while investing in cleaner power solutions for the future. Some of North America's largest and most demanding heavy-duty fleets are actively engaged with Cummins, following their own tests of the natural gas engine in the field. For example, UPS has purchased 250 Kenworth X15N powered trucks in a move the company highlights as an important part of decarbonizing its ground fleet. Cummins had the opportunity to further showcase our Destination Zero strategy in action through our diverse portfolio of power solutions at the recent IAA transportation event in Hannover, Germany. At this event, we displayed our fully integrated powertrain concept featuring our helm engine platforms and e-components. I also personally had an opportunity to hear feedback from Cummins' customers on the challenges they are experiencing with their decarbonization strategies. Common remains confident that our customers' needs will not be met with a single solution. And this event was a great opportunity to further demonstrate that Cummins and Accelera have the right components in our portfolio to provide the necessary solutions for our customers and their needs as they evolve over time. In addition, in October, Accelera by Cummins celebrated the opening of its electrolyzer manufacturing plant in Spain. The plant has a capacity to produce 500 megawatts of electrolyzers per year, scalable to more than 1 gigawatt per year in the future. The sustainably designed facility is expected to create 150 highly skilled jobs in the region with the potential to reach 200 jobs as production grows, and will help scale up development, manufacturing and adoption of zero emissions technologies in Europe. Lastly, I'd like to express that our hearts are with those who were impacted and are still recovering from Hurricanes Helene and Milton here in the U.S. We are grateful that our employees in the impacted areas are all accounted for and safe. While we did see minor impacts in our third quarter financial results, I'm proud of how our Cummins employees rallied together to help impacted employees, communities and facilities, and respond to this tragedy while minimizing disruption in our industry. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America, before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remains strong across many of our key markets and regions, offset by softening in the North America heavy-duty truck market that was in line with our expectations. Sales for the quarter were $8.5 billion, flat compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by continued high demand in our global power generation markets and improved pricing. This was offset by lower North America heavy-duty truck volumes and the reduction in sales from the separation of Atmus. EBITDA was $1.4 billion or 16.4% compared to $1.2 billion or 14.6% a year ago. Third quarter 2023 results included $26 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the third quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiency more than exceeded the reduction in margin from the Atmos separation. Our third quarter revenues in North America declined 1% to $5.2 billion as a softening heavy-duty market, lower light-duty volumes and a reduction in sales from the Atmos separation were mostly offset by strong demand in the medium-duty truck and power generation markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 68,000 units, down 10% from 2023 levels, while [indiscernible] unit sales were $25,000, down 14% from a year ago. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 12% from 2023 levels, while our unit sales were 38,000, up 18%. We shipped 28,000 engines Vistalantis for use in the RAM pickups in the third quarter of 2024, down 31% from 2023. Revenues in North America Power generation increased by 18%, driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. The impressive power generation performance in North America and across the globe helped us achieve record sales and profitability in the Power Systems segment. Our third quarter international revenues increased by 2% compared to last year. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 4% as weaker domestic truck and construction volumes were partially offset with higher data center demand. Industry demand for medium heavy-duty trucks in China was 207,000 units, a decrease of 15% from last year. Demand in the China truck market continues to run at low levels with continued weak domestic diesel market and now softening natural gas orders as the diesel gas price differential narrows. The light-duty market in China was down 4% from 2023 levels at 424,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 30,000, an increase of 14%. Industry demand for excavators in China in the third quarter was 44,000 units, an increase of 10% from 2023 levels. Our units sold were 8,000 units, an increase of 14% as a result of QSM 15 penetration of both new and existing OEM partners and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China roughly doubled in the third quarter, primarily driven by continued growth in data center demand. Third quarter revenue in India, including joint ventures, was $641 million, a decrease of 12% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production decreased by 12%, while our shipments decreased by 18%, driven by a slowdown in manufacturing and government infrastructure spending. Power generation's revenues increased 49% year-on-year, driven by prebuy demand for stationary power out of the CPCB4 emissions regulation changes as well as increased data center demand. Now let me provide our outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Our revenue outlook for 2024 remains consistent with our prior guidance of down 3% to flat. We are improving our overall EBITDA guidance for the year to be approximately 15.5%, the top end of our prior guide of 15% to 15.5%. We now expect higher revenue and stronger profitability in our Power Systems and Distribution segments, offsetting lower revenue and profitability expected in our Components segment. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024. In the third quarter, we saw industry demand softening in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect further softening in the fourth quarter. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are also maintaining our forecast to be 150,000 to 160,000 units, flat to up 5% from 2023 as we continue to benefit from an elevated backlog and strength of vocational orders. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 units in 2024, with the planned model year changeover likely to drive sharp, but temporary production decline in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to decrease 4% in 2024 as a continued weak domestic diesel truck market is partially offset by higher power generation demand. While we have not yet seen a material impact from the recent stimulus actions, we are encouraged that the emphasis on demand side policies is a positive step forward to build economic momentum in China. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 1% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation demand, which is offsetting lower on-highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be down 5% to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, consistent with our prior guidance due to weaker demand in China. We are maintaining our guidance for global power generation markets to be up 15% to 20%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, also consistent with our prior guidance. For aftermarket, our guidance remains at flat to up 5% for 2024, with some softening in rebuild demand expected in the fourth quarter. In summary, we are maintaining our guidance on sales of down 3% to flat and improving our EBITDA guidance to be approximately 15.5%. Our performance in the third quarter, particularly in our Power Systems and Distribution segments resulted in strong profitability despite a softening North America heavy-duty truck market. While we do expect continued softening in several of our key markets in the fourth quarter, we are committed to delivering strong financial performance and returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. I continue to be grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world who are delivering for our customers while also achieving strong financial performance. Our impressive third quarter results and improved full year guidance continue to demonstrate that we remain well positioned to invest in our future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and improve financial performance cycle over cycle. Now let me turn it over to Mark.\nMark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong revenue and profitability in the third quarter. Given the strength, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance and have increased our expectations for EBITDA percent to be at the top end of our prior guidance range. Third quarter revenues were $8.5 billion, flat from a year ago as organic growth offset the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America decreased 1%, while international revenues gained 2%. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1.4 billion or 16.4% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.2 billion or 14.6% of sales a year ago. That those year ago numbers included $26 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. The benefits of pricing, strong operational efficiency and the absence of the Atmus separation costs were the primary drivers behind the improved profitability. Now let's look at each line item in a bit more detail. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 25.7% of sales compared to $2.1 billion or 24.6% last year. The improved margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing, which varied across our different segments, and operational improvements. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 13.8% of sales compared to $1.2 billion or 14.3% last year, which included costs related to the separation of Atmus. Joint venture income of $99 million decreased $19 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower technology fees in our engine business, costs incurred in the start-up of the AMPLIFY Cell Technologies, our battery cell joint venture, which is reported within Accelera and was formed last quarter. Other income was $22 million, an increase of $29 million from a year ago or improvement, driven by mark-to-market gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance. Interest expense was $83 million, a decrease of $14 million from prior year, primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19.2%, including $36 million or $0.26 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $809 million or $5.86 per diluted share compared to $656 million or $4.59 per diluted share in 2023. EPS benefited from the increased earnings and also a lower share count resulting from the tax-free share exchange associated with the separation of Atmus that was completed in the first quarter. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $640 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow was an inflow of $65 million, which included $1.9 billion of payments required by the previously disclosed settlement agreement with the regulatory agencies. Excluding the settlement, third quarter year-to-date operating cash flow was $2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the first 9 months of last year. The lower operating cash flow this year is primarily due to higher inventory. We do expect to see stronger operating cash flow in the fourth quarter this year. I'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, guidance for 2024 includes the operations of Atmus in our consolidated results up until the full separation, which occurred on March 18. Components revenue was $2.7 billion, a decrease of 16% from the prior year, while EBITDA decreased from 13.6% of sales to 12.9%, driven primarily by the dilutive impact of the Atmus separation and a weaker heavy-duty truck market in North America. Several facilities within our Drivetrain and Braking Systems business in North Carolina were impacted by Hurricane Helene at the end of Q3, disrupting production and causing us to record some costs in our third quarter results. Our employees have shown incredible resilience in extremely challenging circumstances and are working very hard to raise production levels. For Components, we expect 2024 full year revenues to decrease 12% to 15%, a decrease of 2% from the prior guidance at the midpoint, and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.3% to 13.8%, lowering the range from our previous guide of 13.7% to 14.2%. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, a decrease of 1% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.7%, an increase from 13.5% a year ago due to operational improvements and positive pricing, including a retroactive pricing agreement in our light-duty business that was finalized within the third quarter. The benefits from pricing and lower operating costs more than offset weaker North American heavy-duty truck volumes. In 2024, we project revenues for the Engine business to be down 2% to [ 1% ], narrowing the range of the prior guidance, and EBITDA to be in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%, consistent with our communication last quarter. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 16% from a year ago to a record $3 billion, driven by increased demand for power generation products particularly for data center applications. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales 12.5% compared to 12.1% a year ago, primarily due to higher volumes and pricing. We now expect 2024 Distribution revenues to be up 8% to 11%, an increase of 2% at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to stronger power generation markets. EBITDA margins are now expected in the range of 11.5% to 12%, also up from our previous guide of 11.3% to 11.8%. Results for the Power Systems segment set another new quarterly record. Revenues were $1.7 billion, an increase of 17%, and EBITDA increased from 16.2% to 19.4% of sales, driven by higher volumes, particularly in the power generation markets, improved pricing and other operational improvements. In 2024, we expect Power Systems revenues to be 8% to 11%, an increase of 4% at the midpoint from our prior guide. EBITDA expectations have also increased to approximately 18.3% to 18.8%, up from 17.75% at the midpoint of the prior guide. Accelera revenues increased 7% to $110 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $115 million compared to a loss of $114 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support those parts of the business where strong growth is expected while reducing costs in areas where we assess the prospects for growth have extended into the future. In 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million and net losses to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million, both unchanged from last quarter. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the third quarter particularly in Power Systems and Distribution, we're improving the full year company guidance for profitability. We still project 2024 company revenues to be down 3% to flat. Company EBITDA margins are now expected -- projected to be approximately 15.5%, which is at the top end of our prior guidance range. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5% for the full year 2024, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items, and down from our prior guidance of an expected tax rate of [ 24 ]. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. In summary, we delivered strong sales and record profitability in the third quarter of 2024. We will experience moderation in some markets in the fourth quarter, most notably North America heavy-duty truck. We have updated our projection for EBITDA to the high end of the prior guidance range due to strong execution, particularly the projected record full year EBITDA in Power Systems and Distribution. We took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forwards, leaving us well positioned to navigate any further economic cyclicality. We are on track to continue our trend of raising performance cycle over cycle whilst continuing to invest in the future. And that's encouraging given that this is projected to be a down year for North American heavy-duty truck production. Our priorities for the remainder of this year for capital allocation remains to reinvest for profitable growth, pay out our strong cash dividends and support our strong credit rating. Thanks for your interest today. Now let me turn it back to Chris.\nChristopher Clulow: Thank you, Mark. Now we'll begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steven Fisher, UBS.\nSteven Fisher: Congrats on the beat and raise. It's hard to find those in machinery world these days. Nevertheless, I think there were some investors that were a little concerned that maybe the Q4 guidance looks a little conservative after the strong Q3. I don't know how much of that is related to the storm impact in Components. But I guess the bigger picture question here is, even though it's maybe a little early, do you think there are enough positives to offset the rest of the downturn that we have in the heavy-duty truck market, however long that may last to keep EBITDA growing over the next year?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So let me just comment first, Steve. Thanks. Great to hear from you. Let me comment a little bit on the fourth quarter and what we expect. There's really 3 factors that I'd point to in the revenue guide for fourth quarter. We expect further softening in the heavy-duty market. I talked about the product changeover with [indiscernible] that will drive further volume reduction in that pickup truck business. And then just working days with year-end will be fewer, and we see across many of our markets, fewer working days associated with the holidays and normal maintenance and [indiscernible] during that period of time. So those are really the factors. As you can see, we're -- the team has done a great job of continuing to focus on profitability across the business, delivering strong decremental margins where we've seen reductions in heavy-duty, which takes a lot of effort. I just want to acknowledge the great work of the team and then leveraging some of the places that we have strength with really strong performance, of course, power gen that impacted Power Systems and DB. And we expect that to continue as we go into next year.\nSteven Fisher: Okay. And maybe just building on that last part there, I mean, how would you describe the momentum in Power Gen right now? I mean, is that new record revenues in the quarter? You're sold out on the 95 liters. Where are you on the capacity utilization on 50 and 78? What's driving the further upside from here? Is it mainly pricing? Or can you kind of push out more volumes?\nJennifer Rumsey: It's really both. So over the course of this year, we've worked on strategic pricing and offsetting some of the inflationary costs that we've seen and pricing for value in that business. And we've been working on capacity in the supply base and our own operational improvements and launching the new [indiscernible] product. So all of those things have given us improvement over the course of the year. 95-liter is at capacity, but we've been able to increase capacity through these improvements by about 30% on that product in '24 of the new products. And then as we talked about previously, we are investing right now to double capacity in the 95-liter. That will come online late next year as we go into '26. We don't see any end in sight in terms of demand in that market. We're the rebuilds up on the 95-liter out the [ '27 ]. So really focused on how do we leverage the capacity we have now, investment we have now while we're bringing more online late next year.\nMark Smith: And I think, Steve, the only thing I'd add to your first question is, we're not -- we're building our plans with a relatively modest start on heavy-duty truck to the first half of next year with what we see right now. So hear your comments and questions, and we're very focused on kind of managing through the cycle.\nJennifer Rumsey: I will say, I mean, in terms of the impact of Helene and Milton, we're back to regular operation in that business and trying to just work through some of the backlog that built up during the period that we were most severely impacted, but it's been a really tremendous effort by the team there. We have multiple facilities in the Western North Carolina region within Cummins Drivetrain and breaking systems that have been dealing with the impact of that working.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Angel Castillo, Morgan Stanley.\nAngel Castillo Malpica: Congrats on a strong quarter. Just wanted to dive a little bit deeper into some of the dynamics that are maybe impacting the next couple of years. I saw some headlines around maybe the California Omnibus low NOx regulation, and some states maybe delaying the kind of model year '25 to maybe model year '26 type enforcement. Just any comments or maybe read-throughs to what maybe that tells you about the underlying kind of enforcement of those regulations and the potential for kind of prebuy into '25, just any broader read-through to maybe or just industry demand for your engines?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean what we've seen, of course, this year is the [indiscernible] bus regulations have gone into place. As we get into '27, we see commonization again between EPA and CARB, which we believe is a positive for the industry. What happens between now and then in terms of different states following those CARB regulations, as you noted some have pushed out, it's a little bit difficult to predict. But certainly, you see lower volumes this year in CARB even with some of the flexibilities that they've put in place to sell 200-milligram NOx product and strong demand nationwide. And so we're watching that space closely. I would say, overall, as Mark noted, we're projecting softening as we go into next year in the heavy-duty truck market and then still anticipating, depending on economic conditions, the prebuy likely starting at some point during '25 ahead of the '27 regulations.\nAngel Castillo Malpica: That's very helpful. And then just wanted to circle back on the prior question around 2025 for power generation. I think you indicated you kind of see growth in power systems and momentum continuing there. Just curious, it seems like your power generation guide of 15% to 20% was unchanged despite continued strong performance there. Can you talk about 2025, just early indications based on your backlog? Should we anticipate kind of that 15% to 20% type growth to persist into next year? Or how do you kind of see that based on kind of pricing and backlog indications today?\nJennifer Rumsey: I mean, really that demand in that market is going to remain strong. So it's all about what we can do in terms of capacity and managing our supply base.\nMark Smith: And that's one of the factors that gives us confidence going at the start of the year, that strong backlog and then, of course, distribution should be -- continue to be pretty resilient absent a big economic shock.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Menges, City.\nKyle Menges: I was hoping I noticed within Power Systems, the Industrial portion actually pretty strong growth in the quarter despite certainly some competitors not showing great results in mining this quarter. So just would love to hear kind of what's driving that reacceleration and growth in that industrial portion and just how you're thinking about that into 4Q and into 2025?\nJennifer Rumsey: I mean, overall, our guidance is pretty flat in the mining market. We've seen some rebuilds demand that you're seeing in those results, but really not significant shifts in that market right now.\nChristopher Clulow: Yes. I think overall, Kyle, I'd just add, yes, the mining is really the key market for us in the industrial side, as you know, and that has remained pretty resilient from our perspective, where it's moved a little down the world. We've maintained a pretty good both in the first-fit side as well as in the aftermarket, which drives the rebuild.\nMark Smith: Don't overread in one quarter it.\nKyle Menges: Got it. And then just a follow-up on Power Systems. -- looks like with the new guidance going to be doing incrementals of about 60% in 2024. So it would be helpful if you could frame just how we might think about incremental margins in that segment and in 2025? And I guess why wouldn't it be kind of close to 40% to 60% again? And what factors maybe could cause weaker incrementals next year for that...\nMark Smith: I do get a use of pushing the Power Systems business a bit hard, so I'll probably stay off the 40% to 60%, but here's what I'd say. Part of the improvement was really a reprioritization and cost kind of reset at the start of this journey, which has really been going on for a couple of years now. So you get that benefit early on, and then there's been a lot more focus on pricing capacity and efficient capacity improvements. So yes, we still think there is more to come on the top line and the bottom line. I don't think we can continue to expect 40% to 60% incremental margins. We will provide specific updates here in February. But with what we know today, we would expect more improvement going into next year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering if you folks can just expand on the margin performance in engine, really outstanding results in the third quarter. The guidance implies margin expansion in the fourth quarter on lower sales. You mentioned operating efficiencies in the prepared remarks. Can you just expand on where those efficiencies are versus pre-COVID levels? And it feels like there's momentum into '25 even if demand is softer, just given where the exit rate looks to be in the fourth quarter versus the cost structure in the first. But I'm wondering if you could just expand around those points, if you don't mind?\nMark Smith: Yes. I think there's been a lot of improvement pre-COVID, no doubt about that, but we're still not all the way back to those kind of 2019 operating levels. So I still think there's more room to come on operational efficiencies. And then we've talked about kind of being at the peak part of this investment cycle. Of course, the strong medium-duty demand has really helped in this environment and our positions continue to strengthen there. So that's really helped. And whilst we have flagged, and it is going to happen, there is going to be short, but sharp reduction in pickup truck engine production in the fourth quarter, we view that as largely temporary. And I think that with all the information we have today that that's going to resume. So I think the top line will face some first half year pressure on heavy duty relative to the first half of this year, but yes, continuing to focus on operating costs. I mentioned briefly in my remarks that we've really been making adjustments to our organization structure and costs since for the fourth quarter of last year. And whilst that hasn't been dramatic in any period, I think that helps set us up well going into next year. Just so you didn't miss it, I did point out not to make a huge deal, but we did get some extra pricing, which helped in the third quarter that was retroactive back to the start of the year. So we won't get all of that again in the fourth quarter, but nevertheless, I think the cost base, the operational efficiencies, maybe not in the short term, but maybe in the medium term, we get some boost from China as well because our earnings are okay, but far from what the full potential of China is in the engine business. So I think there's a lot to look forward to, but the exact timing of earnings accelerating the engine business isn't clear yet. So we've kind of got to focus on the cost and efficiency certainly through the next 9 months.\nJerry Revich: Super. And can I shift gears and ask about the natural gas engine demand now that you've opened up a full rate production. Can you just update us on your expectations of natural gas share in the market 6 to 12 months out based on the demand and the performance of the production ramp that you alluded to in the prepared remarks, please?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean we've said that we think we could get up to a -- potentially 8% share in the market with the natural gas product. We had several big fleets that we're testing it during development. And I noted the [indiscernible] UPS has played. So how they start to ramp up volume, get increasing confidence in the strong performance and efficiency. Fundamentally, in most places, it can provide, not only a reduction in CO2 for fleets that want to lower the CO2 footprint, but also reductions in operating costs because of the fuel price differential between natural gas and diesel. And so fleets that are interested in pursuing that, I think over time, we'll ramp up a target for me to exactly predict because it also depends on some of the economic conditions that are impacting [indiscernible] today of what that will be over 12 months. But we're excited to have that product out now with Kenworth and Daimler will be launched as well in '25. So they'll be positioned with that in the market also.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jamie Cook, Truist Securities.\nJamie Cook: Nice quarter. I guess my first question, you guys have talked about adding capacity on the large engine side. One of your peers came out last quarter and talked about adding even additional capacity in large engines because of demand. So I'm wondering if you're making any changes to your capacity increase that you've talked about historically? And then to what degree do -- how much incremental capacity are you adding that could potentially benefit 2025? And then my follow-up question, Mark. Again, I know someone asked the questions on Q4 versus Q3 margins, and there's an implied step down, but how much was that repricing that you talked about that helped the engine business that maybe we view as onetime? And then within Components, how much of an impact was the hurricanes?\nJennifer Rumsey: Thanks, Jamie. I'll take the first one and let Mark take the second one. So over the course of this year, what you've seen is new products for power generation, capacity within the constraints of the equipment and our supply chain that we have today going up about 30% on the 95-liter. And so that, of course, is going to carry over into next year. And the mantra and power systems right now is just one more, and how do we continue to squeeze every shift, every day, one more out of what we have within our current constraints. And so we'll continue to focus on that and then, of course, working to try to get that doubling of capacity for the 95 by next year. We're continuing to look at it. We want to be smart about where we can make reasonable investments to take capacity up further where we see strong market conditions. So nothing really specific to say right now, but just that we're continuing to look at our footprint and where there may be opportunities.\nMark Smith: On the second part, the first thing I said, we're going to get natural -- I will answer the specific questions you Jamie. I just want to share that we're going to get natural variations from quarter-to-quarter, but I just want to remind that we're very focused on the cost side, on the efficiency side, of course, getting value for the products, which are helping our customers be successful is also important. So yes, the the kind of retroactive element of the pricing was about 50 basis points ballpark for the company in the quarter. There is a go-forward benefit just not as much as that. And then the costs you're talking you're talking low tens of millions of dollars between components and the elimination segment where we incurred some costs for the impacts of Hurricane Helene. So there are puts and takes. There are some positives, there are some negatives in the results. I think the revenue guide, you can see we haven't changed because we are very clear the heavy, medium and pickup truck production and the way that the very well-run customers like to work is to have predictability around the production level. So I think the revenue is well pinned. And I think the key for us is maintaining this strong cost and efficiency discipline as we go into next year and continue to focus on preparing ourselves for more demand and growth in the future and raising these margins as we set out at the Analyst Day and generating more cash, that's a big focus.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tami Zakaria, JP Morgan.\nTami Zakaria: Good morning. Thank you so much. So I sort of adding one more question on incremental margin because I think it's really the start of your performance in recent quarters. So when I look at your incremental margin in the third quarter, it's almost 50% ex the filtration separation, which is quite impressive versus a long-term target of over [ 25 ]. So do you believe your incremental margin target can move up for the long term given the pargeneration product success, engines are seeing some retroactive pricing as well it seems and you have a lot of new products coming in, in the next couple of years. So would you consider revisiting your long-term incremental EBITDA margin target as you begin next year?\nMark Smith: I don't think -- I think we'll give guidance just for the year, and then we'll see how we do. There's a lot of moving parts to our portfolio. Of course, we're feeling like we've done a pretty good job in our core business. Since we had our Analyst Day, incrementally, there have been more headwinds to the Accelera side of the business. But overall, we're pleased with this year. Let's focus on finishing strong for this year. We'll give you our full guidance with all its technicolor when we get to February. So I appreciate the question, but today, we're not going to talk about longer-term targets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer, Melius Research.\nRobert Wertheimer: Just a clarification. On the retroactive pricing, I wonder if you can describe what that is or how much continues? And more fundamentally, whether that indicates that you have any enhanced pricing power through engines, if that was something new and different and then I have a more substantial question after that.\nMark Smith: I don't think we should read anything into it other than it's been a protracted discussion. It's back to January 1 Rob. So that's just sometimes things take a while to resolve.\nChristopher Clulow: Yes. As a reminder, Rob, that's in our light-duty space. So it was more localized there.\nRobert Wertheimer: Perfect. Okay. That helps a lot. Just more fundamentally, obviously, you and largest competitor in large engines are seeing a lot of demand, and your customers must be telling you that you have a big role to play years and years ahead. Is it very clear that even the biggest hyperscale data centers will use RESIP engines on backup. I wonder if you can just talk about what your customers are telling you about the changing sort of design and scope and scale of data centers and where you fit in for the next decade to come?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, I think at this point in the next decade, we think reciprocating engines are going to be the solution for backup power. Of course, they're looking at different potential options for prime power and evaluating what that looks like, but other technologies that we might use from from a lead time cost, reliability, it's hard to match what a diesel gen set can do for backup power. So we really think that's going to be a solution for some time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Raso, Evercore.\nDavid Raso: Back to the prebuy question, I know we're sitting here on election day, so curious to get your thoughts if anything around the election could alter your thoughts around...\nJennifer Rumsey: I'm surprised you made it this far without that question, David.\nDavid Raso: Make sure if you could answer the timing of your introduction of a '27-compliant engine, can you take us through your thoughts around that, the idea of maybe introducing that early, building some credits? Obviously, the nat gas engines already are providing some credits as well. Can you just take us through how you're thinking about the timing of your introductions? And obviously, woven within that, anything you want to comment on on whoever wins the White House and Congress how that impacts your thoughts?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, at the end of the day, Cummins is going to do what we've always done. We're going to work across party lines and engage on issues that are important for our business and our industry, and we'll do that. We've done that with the bid administration of the pass administration will do with the next administration. And what's really important to us and our industry is having that regulatory and legislative stability. And we do not expect any change regardless of the outcome of the election on the [ '27 ] regulations for our industry. So as we have in the past, we're really -- we have a history of being first into the market with products that comply with new regulations and deliver increased value to our customers, and we're always focusing on the landscape, what's the right product at the right time, how do we take -- consider regulatory flexibility and credits as a part of that strategy. And given all that, we do intend to launch the diesel version of the 15-liter helm platform in '26 ahead of the '37 regulation. And with that launch, not only deliver a lower NOx product into the market, but also one that had significant improvement in fuel efficiency and operating costs to decline to 7% efficiency improvement in that product that will deliver value to our customers and then looking to how do we further strengthen our position in that market through these regulatory changes. And this is really consistent with our past strategy, and what's worked well for Cummins over the years is delivering value to our customers through these regulatory changes and strengthening our position in the market. So that's our intention. We've got the 15-liter natural gas out now. We'll add a diesel version of that in '26 and then launch our midrange products at the start of '27.\nDavid Raso: The early introduction of the I assume you were thinking first quarter '26 with the new model years. Can you help us though, it appears in the channel there is some sense that there might be a prebuy of your engines in 25 to get in front of that early '26 introduction. Can you help us a bit, a, is that maybe helping some of the truck orders we're seeing in the industry? I mean you are 40% of the trucks out there. So prebuying cummins would impact total industry numbers pretty meaningfully. And the cost of the new '27 engine coming out early in '26, can you give us some sense of the cost to the customer? And the follow-up will be, how much is the warranty versus the components? I'm just trying to get a sense how much you're bring all '27 costs into '26. It's a case of...\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So let me try to frame it to hope you're thinking that, of course, the specifics on pricing, we're still discussing that with customers, the exact timing and transition between the current and the next-generation 15-liter in '26, we're still in discussions with our customers. So I'm not going to give exact answers there. What I will say is that we are adding meaningful engine and aftertreatment content and technology to both comply with the lower NOx regulation as well as deliver better fuel efficiency and operating cost and value to our customers. And that will be added as we launch this new product in '26. The requirement for a longer emissions warranty does not take effect until '27. So customers that buy this this new high-efficiency market-leading products in '26 will not be [indiscernible].\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye, Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: And related to this transition, I guess, is probably one of the biggest R&D investments the company has ever made. So as we start to kind of get past that. Can you maybe think -- help us think about the direction of R&D spend? It seems like maybe an obvious place to get leverage on future growth. But you did $1.5 billion of spend in '23, going to be around that range for '24. How should we think about that level of spending going forward?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean you've got it. We're investing at a record level, high level with these new platforms that we're bringing into the market. We think those will position us well for the future. And so you'll see some normalization of that. Now the exact shape of that is going to depend, frankly, on how regulations evolve and what the -- what I call the bridge period of technology looks like and how that transitions to zero emissions. But we'll see that coming off of our peak as we get past the '27 product launches, and we'll continue to be investing in R&D to create differentiation and value in the market to grow the business over the long term.\nNoah Kaye: So if you're launching next -- late next year -- or sorry, I think you said '26, then implies we'll start to back down on those peaks.\nJennifer Rumsey: [indiscernible]\nNoah Kaye: Okay. And then just sort of switching gears -- can you characterize the durability of strength in medium duty. I think the 6 and 7 classes have done pretty well. There's still some backlog there. but just talk about the demand you're seeing now in the market and whether that kind of continues into next year. You already kind of commented on some of your expectations for heavy duty. So medium-duty color would be helpful.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, for the year, we're seeing medium -- North America medium-duty up a little bit, flat to up 5%. We're continuing to see pretty strong demand. I mean you've seen a little bit of inventory and normalization of backlog, but we continue to see really strong demand. And with future regulations on that horizon, we expect that's likely to continue into next year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tim  Thein, Raymond James.\nTimothy Thein: The first question is just on the Distribution business. And I'm curious what, if any, mix impact, there could be given the -- if you look at the strength that we've seen and you're projecting to continue for some time in power gen, that's now running at, call it, 10 points higher as a percentage of distribution revenues from a couple of years ago. And while some of that's coming as we've seen parts come down. So maybe in historical terms, that's a mix negative, just as the whole goods grows as a percentage of revenues, but maybe just given the strength in demand and tightness in supply, that's not the case. So maybe just your thoughts on just the mix within distribution and how to think about that going forward?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, as you noted, that typically whole goods is mix margin negative compared to aftermarket for us. If you just step back and look at the business in total, you've got to consider what we've done around inflationary pricing and operational efficiencies have tried to flex up to higher volume, and we're going to continue to focus on those operational efficiencies. But power generation gross revenue mix compared to aftermarket will be negative on the margin line.\nTimothy Thein: Got it. Okay. And then maybe 1...\nMark Smith: Tim, that's where we continue to drive on those operational efficiencies and other areas and, of course, continue to drive as much of the parts business as we can underline. But the most important thing is we're meeting customer expectations and growing earnings in an efficient way.\nTimothy Thein: Got it. And then, Mark, just on the gross margin color that you gave earlier, was the -- you highlighted pricing several times. Was there -- was that -- was all of that from this retroactive deal you had in the light duty? Or was there maybe just...\nMark Smith: I mean year-over-year, there's other pricing, it just -- it was appropriate for the engine to note for the engine business that that was a particular fact. But no, there was other pricing and the overall expectations haven't significantly changed for the rest of the business. Quite frankly, this other pricing we'd expect it to get it at the start of the year and it's just taking time. The most important thing is it's been reset. It's more of a timing issue and a concentration in Q3, we always anticipated something in our full year numbers. So on a full year basis, there's not much to say, but it just came in a more lumpy fashion because of the catch-up nature.\nOperator: Thank you for our last question. I would now like to turn the floor back to Chris Clulow for closing remarks.\nChristopher Clulow: Great. Thanks very much. I appreciate everyone joining today. That concludes our teleconference. I appreciate your participation and continued interest. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call.\nOperator: We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong revenue and profitability in the third quarter. Given the strength, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance and have increased our expectations for EBITDA percent to be at the top end of our prior guidance range. Third quarter revenues were $8.5 billion, flat from a year ago as organic growth offset the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America decreased 1%, while international revenues gained 2%. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1.4 billion or 16.4% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.2 billion or 14.6% of sales a year ago. That those year ago numbers included $26 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. The benefits of pricing, strong operational efficiency and the absence of the Atmus separation costs were the primary drivers behind the improved profitability. Now let's look at each line item in a bit more detail. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.2 billion or 25.7% of sales compared to $2.1 billion or 24.6% last year. The improved margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing, which varied across our different segments, and operational improvements. Selling, admin and research expenses were $1.2 billion or 13.8% of sales compared to $1.2 billion or 14.3% last year, which included costs related to the separation of Atmus. Joint venture income of $99 million decreased $19 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower technology fees in our engine business, costs incurred in the start-up of the AMPLIFY Cell Technologies, our battery cell joint venture, which is reported within Accelera and was formed last quarter. Other income was $22 million, an increase of $29 million from a year ago or improvement, driven by mark-to-market gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance. Interest expense was $83 million, a decrease of $14 million from prior year, primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19.2%, including $36 million or $0.26 per diluted share of favorable discrete items. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $809 million or $5.86 per diluted share compared to $656 million or $4.59 per diluted share in 2023. EPS benefited from the increased earnings and also a lower share count resulting from the tax-free share exchange associated with the separation of Atmus that was completed in the first quarter. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $640 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow was an inflow of $65 million, which included $1.9 billion of payments required by the previously disclosed settlement agreement with the regulatory agencies. Excluding the settlement, third quarter year-to-date operating cash flow was $2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the first 9 months of last year. The lower operating cash flow this year is primarily due to higher inventory. We do expect to see stronger operating cash flow in the fourth quarter this year. I'll now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, guidance for 2024 includes the operations of Atmus in our consolidated results up until the full separation, which occurred on March 18. Components revenue was $2.7 billion, a decrease of 16% from the prior year, while EBITDA decreased from 13.6% of sales to 12.9%, driven primarily by the dilutive impact of the Atmus separation and a weaker heavy-duty truck market in North America. Several facilities within our Drivetrain and Braking Systems business in North Carolina were impacted by Hurricane Helene at the end of Q3, disrupting production and causing us to record some costs in our third quarter results. Our employees have shown incredible resilience in extremely challenging circumstances and are working very hard to raise production levels. For Components, we expect 2024 full year revenues to decrease 12% to 15%, a decrease of 2% from the prior guidance at the midpoint, and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.3% to 13.8%, lowering the range from our previous guide of 13.7% to 14.2%. For the Engine segment, third quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, a decrease of 1% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.7%, an increase from 13.5% a year ago due to operational improvements and positive pricing, including a retroactive pricing agreement in our light-duty business that was finalized within the third quarter. The benefits from pricing and lower operating costs more than offset weaker North American heavy-duty truck volumes. In 2024, we project revenues for the Engine business to be down 2% to [ 1% ], narrowing the range of the prior guidance, and EBITDA to be in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%, consistent with our communication last quarter. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 16% from a year ago to a record $3 billion, driven by increased demand for power generation products particularly for data center applications. EBITDA increased as a percent of sales 12.5% compared to 12.1% a year ago, primarily due to higher volumes and pricing. We now expect 2024 Distribution revenues to be up 8% to 11%, an increase of 2% at the midpoint from our prior guidance, primarily due to stronger power generation markets. EBITDA margins are now expected in the range of 11.5% to 12%, also up from our previous guide of 11.3% to 11.8%. Results for the Power Systems segment set another new quarterly record. Revenues were $1.7 billion, an increase of 17%, and EBITDA increased from 16.2% to 19.4% of sales, driven by higher volumes, particularly in the power generation markets, improved pricing and other operational improvements. In 2024, we expect Power Systems revenues to be 8% to 11%, an increase of 4% at the midpoint from our prior guide. EBITDA expectations have also increased to approximately 18.3% to 18.8%, up from 17.75% at the midpoint of the prior guide. Accelera revenues increased 7% to $110 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $115 million compared to a loss of $114 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support those parts of the business where strong growth is expected while reducing costs in areas where we assess the prospects for growth have extended into the future. In 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million and net losses to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million, both unchanged from last quarter. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the third quarter particularly in Power Systems and Distribution, we're improving the full year company guidance for profitability. We still project 2024 company revenues to be down 3% to flat. Company EBITDA margins are now expected -- projected to be approximately 15.5%, which is at the top end of our prior guidance range. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23.5% for the full year 2024, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items, and down from our prior guidance of an expected tax rate of [ 24 ]. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. In summary, we delivered strong sales and record profitability in the third quarter of 2024. We will experience moderation in some markets in the fourth quarter, most notably North America heavy-duty truck. We have updated our projection for EBITDA to the high end of the prior guidance range due to strong execution, particularly the projected record full year EBITDA in Power Systems and Distribution. We took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forwards, leaving us well positioned to navigate any further economic cyclicality. We are on track to continue our trend of raising performance cycle over cycle whilst continuing to invest in the future. And that's encouraging given that this is projected to be a down year for North American heavy-duty truck production. Our priorities for the remainder of this year for capital allocation remains to reinvest for profitable growth, pay out our strong cash dividends and support our strong credit rating. Thanks for your interest today. Now let me turn it back to Chris. And I think, Steve, the only thing I'd add to your first question is, we're not -- we're building our plans with a relatively modest start on heavy-duty truck to the first half of next year with what we see right now. So hear your comments and questions, and we're very focused on kind of managing through the cycle. And that's one of the factors that gives us confidence going at the start of the year, that strong backlog and then, of course, distribution should be -- continue to be pretty resilient absent a big economic shock. Don't overread in one quarter it. I do get a use of pushing the Power Systems business a bit hard, so I'll probably stay off the 40% to 60%, but here's what I'd say. Part of the improvement was really a reprioritization and cost kind of reset at the start of this journey, which has really been going on for a couple of years now. So you get that benefit early on, and then there's been a lot more focus on pricing capacity and efficient capacity improvements. So yes, we still think there is more to come on the top line and the bottom line. I don't think we can continue to expect 40% to 60% incremental margins. We will provide specific updates here in February. But with what we know today, we would expect more improvement going into next year. Yes. I think there's been a lot of improvement pre-COVID, no doubt about that, but we're still not all the way back to those kind of 2019 operating levels. So I still think there's more room to come on operational efficiencies. And then we've talked about kind of being at the peak part of this investment cycle. Of course, the strong medium-duty demand has really helped in this environment and our positions continue to strengthen there. So that's really helped. And whilst we have flagged, and it is going to happen, there is going to be short, but sharp reduction in pickup truck engine production in the fourth quarter, we view that as largely temporary. And I think that with all the information we have today that that's going to resume. So I think the top line will face some first half year pressure on heavy duty relative to the first half of this year, but yes, continuing to focus on operating costs. I mentioned briefly in my remarks that we've really been making adjustments to our organization structure and costs since for the fourth quarter of last year. And whilst that hasn't been dramatic in any period, I think that helps set us up well going into next year. Just so you didn't miss it, I did point out not to make a huge deal, but we did get some extra pricing, which helped in the third quarter that was retroactive back to the start of the year. So we won't get all of that again in the fourth quarter, but nevertheless, I think the cost base, the operational efficiencies, maybe not in the short term, but maybe in the medium term, we get some boost from China as well because our earnings are okay, but far from what the full potential of China is in the engine business. So I think there's a lot to look forward to, but the exact timing of earnings accelerating the engine business isn't clear yet. So we've kind of got to focus on the cost and efficiency certainly through the next 9 months. On the second part, the first thing I said, we're going to get natural -- I will answer the specific questions you Jamie. I just want to share that we're going to get natural variations from quarter-to-quarter, but I just want to remind that we're very focused on the cost side, on the efficiency side, of course, getting value for the products, which are helping our customers be successful is also important. So yes, the the kind of retroactive element of the pricing was about 50 basis points ballpark for the company in the quarter. There is a go-forward benefit just not as much as that. And then the costs you're talking you're talking low tens of millions of dollars between components and the elimination segment where we incurred some costs for the impacts of Hurricane Helene. So there are puts and takes. There are some positives, there are some negatives in the results. I think the revenue guide, you can see we haven't changed because we are very clear the heavy, medium and pickup truck production and the way that the very well-run customers like to work is to have predictability around the production level. So I think the revenue is well pinned. And I think the key for us is maintaining this strong cost and efficiency discipline as we go into next year and continue to focus on preparing ourselves for more demand and growth in the future and raising these margins as we set out at the Analyst Day and generating more cash, that's a big focus. I don't think -- I think we'll give guidance just for the year, and then we'll see how we do. There's a lot of moving parts to our portfolio. Of course, we're feeling like we've done a pretty good job in our core business. Since we had our Analyst Day, incrementally, there have been more headwinds to the Accelera side of the business. But overall, we're pleased with this year. Let's focus on finishing strong for this year. We'll give you our full guidance with all its technicolor when we get to February. So I appreciate the question, but today, we're not going to talk about longer-term targets. I don't think we should read anything into it other than it's been a protracted discussion. It's back to January 1 Rob. So that's just sometimes things take a while to resolve. Tim, that's where we continue to drive on those operational efficiencies and other areas and, of course, continue to drive as much of the parts business as we can underline. But the most important thing is we're meeting customer expectations and growing earnings in an efficient way. I mean year-over-year, there's other pricing, it just -- it was appropriate for the engine to note for the engine business that that was a particular fact. But no, there was other pricing and the overall expectations haven't significantly changed for the rest of the business. Quite frankly, this other pricing we'd expect it to get it at the start of the year and it's just taking time. The most important thing is it's been reset. It's more of a timing issue and a concentration in Q3, we always anticipated something in our full year numbers. So on a full year basis, there's not much to say, but it just came in a more lumpy fashion because of the catch-up nature."

            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter accomplishments and financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our third quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our financial performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major accomplishments from the third quarter. In September, we started full production of our X15N natural gas engine at our Jamestown Engine plan, which is the first version of our 15-liter helm platform to launch in the U.S. the X15N delivers performance, durability and power required in a variety of applications and is an excellent alternative for fleet looking to significantly reduce their carbon footprint. This is an important milestone in the execution of our Destination Zero strategy as we work to reduce the impact of our products today while investing in cleaner power solutions for the future. Some of North America's largest and most demanding heavy-duty fleets are actively engaged with Cummins, following their own tests of the natural gas engine in the field. For example, UPS has purchased 250 Kenworth X15N powered trucks in a move the company highlights as an important part of decarbonizing its ground fleet. Cummins had the opportunity to further showcase our Destination Zero strategy in action through our diverse portfolio of power solutions at the recent IAA transportation event in Hannover, Germany. At this event, we displayed our fully integrated powertrain concept featuring our helm engine platforms and e-components. I also personally had an opportunity to hear feedback from Cummins' customers on the challenges they are experiencing with their decarbonization strategies. Common remains confident that our customers' needs will not be met with a single solution. And this event was a great opportunity to further demonstrate that Cummins and Accelera have the right components in our portfolio to provide the necessary solutions for our customers and their needs as they evolve over time. In addition, in October, Accelera by Cummins celebrated the opening of its electrolyzer manufacturing plant in Spain. The plant has a capacity to produce 500 megawatts of electrolyzers per year, scalable to more than 1 gigawatt per year in the future. The sustainably designed facility is expected to create 150 highly skilled jobs in the region with the potential to reach 200 jobs as production grows, and will help scale up development, manufacturing and adoption of zero emissions technologies in Europe. Lastly, I'd like to express that our hearts are with those who were impacted and are still recovering from Hurricanes Helene and Milton here in the U.S. We are grateful that our employees in the impacted areas are all accounted for and safe. While we did see minor impacts in our third quarter financial results, I'm proud of how our Cummins employees rallied together to help impacted employees, communities and facilities, and respond to this tragedy while minimizing disruption in our industry. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the third quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America, before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remains strong across many of our key markets and regions, offset by softening in the North America heavy-duty truck market that was in line with our expectations. Sales for the quarter were $8.5 billion, flat compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by continued high demand in our global power generation markets and improved pricing. This was offset by lower North America heavy-duty truck volumes and the reduction in sales from the separation of Atmus. EBITDA was $1.4 billion or 16.4% compared to $1.2 billion or 14.6% a year ago. Third quarter 2023 results included $26 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the third quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher power generation volumes, pricing and operational efficiency more than exceeded the reduction in margin from the Atmos separation. Our third quarter revenues in North America declined 1% to $5.2 billion as a softening heavy-duty market, lower light-duty volumes and a reduction in sales from the Atmos separation were mostly offset by strong demand in the medium-duty truck and power generation markets. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the third quarter was 68,000 units, down 10% from 2023 levels, while [indiscernible] unit sales were $25,000, down 14% from a year ago. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 12% from 2023 levels, while our unit sales were 38,000, up 18%. We shipped 28,000 engines Vistalantis for use in the RAM pickups in the third quarter of 2024, down 31% from 2023. Revenues in North America Power generation increased by 18%, driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. The impressive power generation performance in North America and across the globe helped us achieve record sales and profitability in the Power Systems segment. Our third quarter international revenues increased by 2% compared to last year. Third quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 4% as weaker domestic truck and construction volumes were partially offset with higher data center demand. Industry demand for medium heavy-duty trucks in China was 207,000 units, a decrease of 15% from last year. Demand in the China truck market continues to run at low levels with continued weak domestic diesel market and now softening natural gas orders as the diesel gas price differential narrows. The light-duty market in China was down 4% from 2023 levels at 424,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 30,000, an increase of 14%. Industry demand for excavators in China in the third quarter was 44,000 units, an increase of 10% from 2023 levels. Our units sold were 8,000 units, an increase of 14% as a result of QSM 15 penetration of both new and existing OEM partners and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China roughly doubled in the third quarter, primarily driven by continued growth in data center demand. Third quarter revenue in India, including joint ventures, was $641 million, a decrease of 12% from the third quarter a year ago. Industry truck production decreased by 12%, while our shipments decreased by 18%, driven by a slowdown in manufacturing and government infrastructure spending. Power generation's revenues increased 49% year-on-year, driven by prebuy demand for stationary power out of the CPCB4 emissions regulation changes as well as increased data center demand. Now let me provide our outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. Our revenue outlook for 2024 remains consistent with our prior guidance of down 3% to flat. We are improving our overall EBITDA guidance for the year to be approximately 15.5%, the top end of our prior guide of 15% to 15.5%. We now expect higher revenue and stronger profitability in our Power Systems and Distribution segments, offsetting lower revenue and profitability expected in our Components segment. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024. In the third quarter, we saw industry demand softening in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect further softening in the fourth quarter. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are also maintaining our forecast to be 150,000 to 160,000 units, flat to up 5% from 2023 as we continue to benefit from an elevated backlog and strength of vocational orders. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 units in 2024, with the planned model year changeover likely to drive sharp, but temporary production decline in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures to decrease 4% in 2024 as a continued weak domestic diesel truck market is partially offset by higher power generation demand. While we have not yet seen a material impact from the recent stimulus actions, we are encouraged that the emphasis on demand side policies is a positive step forward to build economic momentum in China. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 1% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation demand, which is offsetting lower on-highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be down 5% to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, consistent with our prior guidance due to weaker demand in China. We are maintaining our guidance for global power generation markets to be up 15% to 20%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, also consistent with our prior guidance. For aftermarket, our guidance remains at flat to up 5% for 2024, with some softening in rebuild demand expected in the fourth quarter. In summary, we are maintaining our guidance on sales of down 3% to flat and improving our EBITDA guidance to be approximately 15.5%. Our performance in the third quarter, particularly in our Power Systems and Distribution segments resulted in strong profitability despite a softening North America heavy-duty truck market. While we do expect continued softening in several of our key markets in the fourth quarter, we are committed to delivering strong financial performance and returning cash to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders. I continue to be grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world who are delivering for our customers while also achieving strong financial performance. Our impressive third quarter results and improved full year guidance continue to demonstrate that we remain well positioned to invest in our future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and improve financial performance cycle over cycle. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Yes. So let me just comment first, Steve. Thanks. Great to hear from you. Let me comment a little bit on the fourth quarter and what we expect. There's really 3 factors that I'd point to in the revenue guide for fourth quarter. We expect further softening in the heavy-duty market. I talked about the product changeover with [indiscernible] that will drive further volume reduction in that pickup truck business. And then just working days with year-end will be fewer, and we see across many of our markets, fewer working days associated with the holidays and normal maintenance and [indiscernible] during that period of time. So those are really the factors. As you can see, we're -- the team has done a great job of continuing to focus on profitability across the business, delivering strong decremental margins where we've seen reductions in heavy-duty, which takes a lot of effort. I just want to acknowledge the great work of the team and then leveraging some of the places that we have strength with really strong performance, of course, power gen that impacted Power Systems and DB. And we expect that to continue as we go into next year. It's really both. So over the course of this year, we've worked on strategic pricing and offsetting some of the inflationary costs that we've seen and pricing for value in that business. And we've been working on capacity in the supply base and our own operational improvements and launching the new [indiscernible] product. So all of those things have given us improvement over the course of the year. 95-liter is at capacity, but we've been able to increase capacity through these improvements by about 30% on that product in '24 of the new products. And then as we talked about previously, we are investing right now to double capacity in the 95-liter. That will come online late next year as we go into '26. We don't see any end in sight in terms of demand in that market. We're the rebuilds up on the 95-liter out the [ '27 ]. So really focused on how do we leverage the capacity we have now, investment we have now while we're bringing more online late next year. I will say, I mean, in terms of the impact of Helene and Milton, we're back to regular operation in that business and trying to just work through some of the backlog that built up during the period that we were most severely impacted, but it's been a really tremendous effort by the team there. We have multiple facilities in the Western North Carolina region within Cummins Drivetrain and breaking systems that have been dealing with the impact of that working. Yes. I mean what we've seen, of course, this year is the [indiscernible] bus regulations have gone into place. As we get into '27, we see commonization again between EPA and CARB, which we believe is a positive for the industry. What happens between now and then in terms of different states following those CARB regulations, as you noted some have pushed out, it's a little bit difficult to predict. But certainly, you see lower volumes this year in CARB even with some of the flexibilities that they've put in place to sell 200-milligram NOx product and strong demand nationwide. And so we're watching that space closely. I would say, overall, as Mark noted, we're projecting softening as we go into next year in the heavy-duty truck market and then still anticipating, depending on economic conditions, the prebuy likely starting at some point during '25 ahead of the '27 regulations. I mean, really that demand in that market is going to remain strong. So it's all about what we can do in terms of capacity and managing our supply base. I mean, overall, our guidance is pretty flat in the mining market. We've seen some rebuilds demand that you're seeing in those results, but really not significant shifts in that market right now. Yes. I mean we've said that we think we could get up to a -- potentially 8% share in the market with the natural gas product. We had several big fleets that we're testing it during development. And I noted the [indiscernible] UPS has played. So how they start to ramp up volume, get increasing confidence in the strong performance and efficiency. Fundamentally, in most places, it can provide, not only a reduction in CO2 for fleets that want to lower the CO2 footprint, but also reductions in operating costs because of the fuel price differential between natural gas and diesel. And so fleets that are interested in pursuing that, I think over time, we'll ramp up a target for me to exactly predict because it also depends on some of the economic conditions that are impacting [indiscernible] today of what that will be over 12 months. But we're excited to have that product out now with Kenworth and Daimler will be launched as well in '25. So they'll be positioned with that in the market also. Thanks, Jamie. I'll take the first one and let Mark take the second one. So over the course of this year, what you've seen is new products for power generation, capacity within the constraints of the equipment and our supply chain that we have today going up about 30% on the 95-liter. And so that, of course, is going to carry over into next year. And the mantra and power systems right now is just one more, and how do we continue to squeeze every shift, every day, one more out of what we have within our current constraints. And so we'll continue to focus on that and then, of course, working to try to get that doubling of capacity for the 95 by next year. We're continuing to look at it. We want to be smart about where we can make reasonable investments to take capacity up further where we see strong market conditions. So nothing really specific to say right now, but just that we're continuing to look at our footprint and where there may be opportunities. Yes. I mean, I think at this point in the next decade, we think reciprocating engines are going to be the solution for backup power. Of course, they're looking at different potential options for prime power and evaluating what that looks like, but other technologies that we might use from from a lead time cost, reliability, it's hard to match what a diesel gen set can do for backup power. So we really think that's going to be a solution for some time. I'm surprised you made it this far without that question, David. Yes. I mean, at the end of the day, Cummins is going to do what we've always done. We're going to work across party lines and engage on issues that are important for our business and our industry, and we'll do that. We've done that with the bid administration of the pass administration will do with the next administration. And what's really important to us and our industry is having that regulatory and legislative stability. And we do not expect any change regardless of the outcome of the election on the [ '27 ] regulations for our industry. So as we have in the past, we're really -- we have a history of being first into the market with products that comply with new regulations and deliver increased value to our customers, and we're always focusing on the landscape, what's the right product at the right time, how do we take -- consider regulatory flexibility and credits as a part of that strategy. And given all that, we do intend to launch the diesel version of the 15-liter helm platform in '26 ahead of the '37 regulation. And with that launch, not only deliver a lower NOx product into the market, but also one that had significant improvement in fuel efficiency and operating costs to decline to 7% efficiency improvement in that product that will deliver value to our customers and then looking to how do we further strengthen our position in that market through these regulatory changes. And this is really consistent with our past strategy, and what's worked well for Cummins over the years is delivering value to our customers through these regulatory changes and strengthening our position in the market. So that's our intention. We've got the 15-liter natural gas out now. We'll add a diesel version of that in '26 and then launch our midrange products at the start of '27. Yes. So let me try to frame it to hope you're thinking that, of course, the specifics on pricing, we're still discussing that with customers, the exact timing and transition between the current and the next-generation 15-liter in '26, we're still in discussions with our customers. So I'm not going to give exact answers there. What I will say is that we are adding meaningful engine and aftertreatment content and technology to both comply with the lower NOx regulation as well as deliver better fuel efficiency and operating cost and value to our customers. And that will be added as we launch this new product in '26. The requirement for a longer emissions warranty does not take effect until '27. So customers that buy this this new high-efficiency market-leading products in '26 will not be [indiscernible]. Yes. I mean you've got it. We're investing at a record level, high level with these new platforms that we're bringing into the market. We think those will position us well for the future. And so you'll see some normalization of that. Now the exact shape of that is going to depend, frankly, on how regulations evolve and what the -- what I call the bridge period of technology looks like and how that transitions to zero emissions. But we'll see that coming off of our peak as we get past the '27 product launches, and we'll continue to be investing in R&D to create differentiation and value in the market to grow the business over the long term. [indiscernible] Yes. I mean, for the year, we're seeing medium -- North America medium-duty up a little bit, flat to up 5%. We're continuing to see pretty strong demand. I mean you've seen a little bit of inventory and normalization of backlog, but we continue to see really strong demand. And with future regulations on that horizon, we expect that's likely to continue into next year. Yes. I mean, as you noted, that typically whole goods is mix margin negative compared to aftermarket for us. If you just step back and look at the business in total, you've got to consider what we've done around inflationary pricing and operational efficiencies have tried to flex up to higher volume, and we're going to continue to focus on those operational efficiencies. But power generation gross revenue mix compared to aftermarket will be negative on the margin line."

I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey, to kick us off.\nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris and good morning. I'm excited to be with all of you today as I celebrate my two-year anniversary of becoming CEO of Cummins. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major accomplishments from the second quarter. At our recent Analyst Day, I shared that we are raising our long-term financial targets as a result of our of our strengthening portfolio and continued execution our Destination Zero strategy. The strong partnerships that we have with customers and stakeholders are key to driving our strategy and growth profile forward. In this quarter, we strengthened those partnerships even further. In May, we announced with Isuzu Motors Limited the launch of a new 6.7-liter engine designed for use in Isuzu medium-duty truck lineup. This engine will power on-highway truck applications for the Japan market and will be available for Asia-Pacific markets and other global markets later this year. We also announced plans to launch a battery electric powertrain for Isuzu's F-Series in North America. Availability of the medium-duty truck is expected in 2026 and will include Accelera's next-generation lithium-ion phosphate or LFP battery technology. These advancements mark an important milestone for both Cummins and Isuzu as Cummins enters the Japan on-highway market for the first time in our history. We are proud of the partnership our two companies have built, and I'm excited to leverage our collective strength and scale to deliver profitable growth for both partners. Also this quarter, we further progressed our partnership with Daimler Trucks and buses and PACCAR as we completed the formation of joint venture now known as Amplify Cell Technologies, to localize battery cell production in the in the battery supply chain the United States. This included naming the Chief Executive Officer of joint venture and breaking ground at a new manufacturing plant in Marshall County, Mississippi. Amplify Cell Technologies will enable Accelera by Cummins and our partners to advance battery cells focused on commercial and industrial applications in North America and serve our customers' evolving needs. This is a significant step forward as we continue leading our industry into the next era of smarter, cleaner power. And in July, Accelera was awarded $75 million from the Department of Energy to convert approximately 360,000 square feet of existing manufacturing space at our Columbus, Indiana engine plant for zero emissions components, including battery packs and electric powertrain systems. The $75 million grant is the largest federal grant ever awarded solely to Cummins and as part of the appropriations related to the inflation Reduction Act. The Columbus engine plant is also where we manufacture blocks and heads for our current and next-generation engine-based solutions, further showcasing our Destination Zero strategy in action. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions, resulting in record revenues the second quarter of 2024. Sales for the quarter were $8.8 billion, an increase of 2% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by continued high demand and improved pricing. EBITDA was $1.35 billion or 15.3% compared to $1.3 billion or 15.1% a year ago. Second quarter 2023 results included $23 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the second quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded supply chain cost increases and offset the impact of the Atmus separation. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 4% to $5.5 billion, driven by the strong demand in our core markets more than offsetting the impact of the separation of Atmus. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter were 75,000 units, up 1% from 2023 levels. While our heavy-duty unit sales were 31,000, up 7% from a year ago. The second quarter marked record production volume for our heavy-duty engines at the Jamestown Engine plant. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 4% from 2023 levels, while our unit sales were 38,000, up 13% and also outpacing the market growth. We shipped 41,000 engines to Stellantis for using the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2024, up 8% from 2023. Revenues in North America power generation increased by 23% and driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. The impressive power generation performance in North America and across the globe helped us achieve record sales and profitability in the Power Systems segment. Our second quarter international revenues decreased 2% compared to last year. Second quarter in China, including joint venture, were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 2% as weaker domestic volumes were partially offset with higher data center demand. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 270,000 units, a decrease of 3% from last year. Demand in the China truck market continues to run at low levels with higher orders for natural gas engines and strong exports offsetting weak domestic diesel demand. In light-duty market in China, we were up 4% from 2023 levels at 480,000 units while our units sold, including joint ventures, were $33,000, an increase of 18%. The industry demand for excavators in China in the second quarter was 53,000 units, an increase of 4% from 2023 levels. Our units sold were 10,000 units, an increase of 19% as a result of QSM15 penetration at both new and existing OEM partners and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 36% in the second quarter, primarily driven by accelerating demand in data centers. This helped drive impressive financial performance at our Cummins Chongqing joint venture within our Power Systems business. Second quarter revenues in India, including joint venture, were $649 million, a decrease of 10% from the second quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 11% and while our shipments increased by 5%. Power Generation revenues decreased by 17% year-on-year as the second quarter of 2023 benefited from pre-buy demand ahead of emissions regulation changes. Now, let me provide our outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. We have raised our expectations for 2024, while still anticipating the second half to be weaker than the first half, primarily in the North America heavy-duty truck market. We are increasing our revenue guidance to down 3% to flat compared to our prior guidance of down 2% to down 5%. We are also increasing our EBITDA guide to be 15% to 15.5%, compared to our prior guide of 14.5% to 15.5%. We now expect higher revenue in our Engine, Power Systems and Distribution segments, offsetting slightly lower revenue expectations for the Accelera business. We also expect stronger profitability in our Engine and Power Systems segments, driving most of the improvement in EBITDA. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024 as we still expect softening in the second half of the year. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are raising our forecast to be 150,000 to 160,000 units, flat to up 5% from 2023. This is an increase from our previous guidance by 10,000 units as we continue to benefit from an elevated backlog and strength in vocational orders. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 in 2024, with a planned model year changeover likely to drive a temporary dip in production in the second half. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 8% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect slightly weaker property investment and slowing export demand in China. We are raising our guidance for the global power generation market to be up 15% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of up 10% to 15%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with our prior guidance. For aftermarket, we have improved our guidance to flat to up 5% for 2024, raising the bottom end of our previous guidance of a decline of 5%, with demand holding up better than expected in on- and off-highway markets. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $400 million to $450 million, a reduction of $50 million from the prior guide. As we noted at our Analyst Day, the energy transition is progressing more slowly, impacting both our e-mobility and electrolyzer revenues. In summary, coming off a strong first half of the year, we are raising our guidance on sales to down 3% to flat and raising our EBITDA guidance to 15% to 15.5%. While we anticipate softening in the North America heavy-duty market in the second half of the year, demand in several of our core markets remain strong. Should economic momentum slow, Cummins is in a strong position to keep investing in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash shareholders. In July, we announced an 8.3% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.68 to $1.82 per share, the 15th consecutive year in which we have increased the dividend. During the quarter, we returned $230 million to shareholders in the form of dividends consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders. Our diluted earnings per share benefited from a lower number of shares outstanding with the impact of the Atmus split more fully reflected in the weighted average share count in the second quarter. In summary, we had a strong performance in the first half of 2024, driven by record demand for Cummins products in our core markets. It is exciting to see our business grow with long-established customers in existing markets and to see newer partnerships yield additional opportunities in previously untapped markets for Cummins. I'm grateful for our employees who continue to execute on our strategy and deliver solutions that help our customers win wherever they operate. Our results reflect our dedication to delivering strong financial performance while also investing in our future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and returning cash to our shareholders. As we discussed at Analyst Day, there is a lot to be excited about in our future. Now let me turn it over to Mark.\nMark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the second quarter. Given the strength of those results and our improved outlook, we've raised the midpoint of our full year expectations for 2024. Second quarter revenues were $8.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago, as organic growth more than offset the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America increased 4%, while international revenues decreased 2%. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1.35 billion or 15.3% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.3 billion or 15.1% a year ago. The year ago numbers included $23 million of costs related to the separation of apps. The benefits of higher volumes and pricing as well as the absence of the separation costs were the primary drivers behind the improved profitability. Now I'll go into a little more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.19 billion or 24.9% of sales compared to $2.15 billion or also 24.9% a year ago. Flat margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, offset by the removal of Atmus and higher compensation expenses. Selling, admin, and research expenses were $1.21 billion or 13.7% of sales compared to $1.26 billion or 14.6% last year. Joint venture income of $103 million decreased $30 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower technology fees and the weak domestic truck market in China. Other income was negative $3 million, a decrease of $27 million a year ago. Interest expense was $109 million, an increase of $10 million from prior year, primarily driven by higher weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%, including $9 million or $0.07 per diluted share of favorable discrete tax items. All in net earnings for the quarter were $726 million or $5.26 per diluted share compared to $720 million or $5.05 per diluted share in Q2 last year. The second quarter reflected the lower weighted average share count as a result of the tax-free share exchange that there was the final separation of Atmus was completed in the first quarter. All-in, operating cash flow was an outflow of $851 million compared to an inflow of $483 million in the second quarter last year, and the decrease was driven mainly by the $1.9 billion payment required by the previously disclosed settlement agreements with the regulatory agencies. Excluding the settlement, operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.1 billion, more than double the cash generated in the second quarter last year. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, guidance for 2024 includes the operations Atmus in our consolidated results up until the full separation that occurred on March 18th. Components segment revenue was $3 billion, a decrease of 13% from the prior year, while EBITDA decreased from 14.2% of sales to 13.6%, with both sales and EBITDA primarily impacted by the Atmus separation. For Components, we expect 2024 revenues to decrease 9% to 14%, consistent with our prior projections and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%, narrowing the range from our previous guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. For the Engine segment, second quarter revenues were a record $3.2 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.1%, a slight decrease from 14.2% a year ago. As the benefit from pricing and record on-highway volumes in North America was offset by higher research costs and lower joint venture income, primarily in China. In 2024, we now project 2024, we now project -- for the full year sorry, we now project revenues for the Engine business to be down 3% to up 2%, an increase of 2% from the prior midpoint, driven by a revised outlook in the North American medium-duty truck market. Full year Engine EBITDA is projected to be in the range of $13.7 million to $14.2 million, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint from our prior projections due to higher volumes and ongoing operational efficiencies. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 9% from a year ago to a record $2.8 billion. EBITDA as a percent of sales decreased to 11.1% compared to 11.4% a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation expenses and a higher mix of power generation sales, which are positive for the company overall, but have a dilutive impact on the Distribution segment margins. We now expect 2024 Distribution revenues to be up 5% to 10%, an increase of 5% from the prior midpoint, mainly due to stronger power generation markets. And we've revised our EBITDA margin expectations to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.8%, down a little from our prior range of 11.5% to 12.5%. Results for the Power Systems segment set a new quarterly record. Revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 9% and EBITDA increased from 13.8% and to 18.9%, driven by higher volumes, particularly in power generation markets, improved pricing and other operational improvements and cost reduction. For 2024, we expect Power Systems revenues to be up 3% to 8%, an increase of 3% from the prior year guide. EBITDA is now projected to be approximately 17.5% to 18% and up from the previous projections of 16% to 17%. Accelera revenues increased 31% to $111 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $117 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $114 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support those parts of the business where strong growth is expected, whilst reducing costs in areas where we accept the prospects for growth have extended into the future. In 2024, we expect Accelera revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million, down $50 million from our prior guide. Net losses are still expected to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the second quarter and the revised outlook in our key region end markets, we have raised our full year company guidance. We now expect revenues to be down 3% to flat, which is better than our previous guidance of down 2% to down 5%. EBITDA margins are now projected to be approximately 15% to 15.5%, narrowing the range and increasing the midpoint 25 basis points from our prior guide. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in 2024, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, unchanged from three months ago, as we continue make critical investments in new products and capacity expansion to support future growth. In summary, we delivered record sales and solid profitability in the second quarter of 2024. We still do expect some moderation in some key markets in the second half of the year, especially North American heavy-duty truck, as we pointed out at our recent Analyst Day also. We've taken some cost to reduce -- we took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forward, leaving us well-positioned to navigate any economic cyclicality that we may experience. We continue to deliver strong financial results raising our performance cycle over cycle while still investing for future growth. Our priorities for this year for capital allocation remain to reinvest for growth, increase the dividend, and reduce debt. Overall, a very strong quarter. Thanks for your time today. Now, let me turn it back over to Chris.\nChris Clulow: Thank you, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Fisher: Thanks. Good morning. Just on China truck, you didn't change your expectations there. Wondering how you're thinking about some of the new incentives that the government put in place there to support the second half of the year. Is that a potential point of conservatism in your outlook? Or do you think it may not materialize in there?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Thanks for the question, Steven. Good morning. We've seen pretty consistent performance out of China and the economic conditions over the last 18 to 24 months, and there's been previous indications of actions the government may take, none of which has really translated into any meaningful change in our industry. So, really, we're seeing the strong performance still with natural gas product an export and a relatively weak domestic diesel market and are not anticipating that changing in the near-term.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Cook: Hi, congratulations on a nice and clean quarter. I guess two questions. One, Mark, the margins in Power Systems are quite remarkable on a pretty muted sales growth assumption for 2024. So, if you could just help us understand what's going on there, sort of what's structural versus -- and do you see the opportunity for margins to improve from these levels in the out years given you're already assuming a close to 18% margin this year? And then my second question, Jen, just -- I know you don't want to give a guide for 2025, but how you're thinking about the markets? Is there -- as you think about the U.S. with the potential -- with the election and the overruling of Chevron, are you more conservative about a potential pre-buy? Do you think that gets pushed out? I guess the two positives would be China comes back and then the power system. So, I'm wondering, ultimately, is the incremental margin potential better in 2025 with those assumptions on a muted 2025 pre-buy with better mix from Power Systems in China? Thanks.\nMark Smith: Okay. Good questions. We'll try and fit in our answers with the time available for us this evening. On Power Systems, there's really three elements to the margins. And to answer the last part of your question, yes, we do expect there's still more to come. So, the team there is doing a fantastic job, started with some cost reduction, reprioritizing where we're where we're investing, investing less, strong pricing environment on the Power Systems side and then yes, there's more to do on the operational efficiency. So really, it's several strings to the bow in terms of what's been driving the results and still more to come. So we're really, really excited. Hopefully, you felt the confidence from Jenny Bush and to the team from the Analyst Day and have continued to deliver here in the second quarter, and we're bullish on that segment. That's -- those are really the main drivers on Power Systems.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. On the market outlook, what I would say is in the power gen market, the continued growth that we see there, in particular the data center, I don't see that letting up anytime soon, and where we have strong demand, high backlog. And as you know, we talked about in May, making some capacity investments to take advantage of the growing market there. In US on-highway, the medium-duty truck has continued to be strong. We see strong backlog and demand and don't see that letting up in the foreseeable future. and heavy duty, we do see build rates coming down, projecting about 10% down in the third quarter and 20% overall for the second half of year. And the question is what will happen next year with the broader economic environment because well stabilized spot rates and these truck prices are at a lower level than they've been historically, and that's impacted some of our customers demand. And so how that comes together with a pre-buy. The Supreme Court overturning of the Chevron deference, we don't anticipate any impacting regulations in the near-term. We believe that 2027 regulations will continue to move forward. And probably the bigger question is what we see with Phase 3 greenhouse gas in the 2030 time frame. And so we still anticipate some amount of pre-buy ahead of that emissions changeover. But the industry has also demonstrated there's capacity constraints that we've seen in the last couple of years. So how large that pre-buy will be, I think is still question, but we're preparing to have strong demand as we go into the 2027 regulation change.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Volkmann: Great. Thank you, guys. Mark, I think you mentioned maybe both of your pricing being positive. It sounds like it was positive in truck. It sounds like its positive in Power Gen. Can you just double-click on that for us a little bit? I mean how much pricing are you seeing? And sort of how should we think about that for the rest of the year?\nMark Smith: Yes. Great questions. So on average, across the company, very, very much by segment, but 2.5% for the year, and that really hasn't changed. That's not changed in the results, but it definitely has been an important driver of the Power Systems results. And I don't think it's going to vary a lot that year-over-year increase should mostly hold across all the quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. And Jennifer, Happy Anniversary.\nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you.\nJerry Revich: I wanted to ask on the medium-duty engine platforms globally, right? So you folks are picking up Daimler's business, now you're picking up Isuzu business in Japan. Can you just expand and talk to us about how many more medium-duty engines, you folks expect to ship globally 2026 versus, I don't know, call it, two or three years ago, given the timing of the transition? And if you could just comment on Japan, is it -- help place to import product into given the currency. Can you just talk about how you folks are able to do that economically? Thank you.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah, sure. So you've seen this trend and some of the announcement that we made over the last few years playing out now as regulations start to occur. So we're seeing growing medium-duty demand in the US, of course, with Daimler transitioning to us and us as well as some other customers like keno here in the US. So we're growing our position in the medium-duty market here. We've now launched the medium-duty product in India with Daimler. So we'll start to see some volume there. Their strategy is really driven by regulation change. So when you see regulation change in Europe and Brazil will continue to grow volume with Daimler. On the Isuzu business, we are building that new B6.7 and their Tohoku plant in Japan. So we're not importing that engine. We're building it in the market. First time we've been on-highway market, we've been in the off-highway market there, of course, for many years. And so we'll see some slow volume growth there in Japan. And then as I noted, they'll then launch that truck into other Asia Pacific and global markets later this year. So you're just going to see steady growth, I would say, from Cummins year-over-year in the medium-duty space as these new customer partnerships grow and emissions regulations change and ads.\nMark Smith: In India and Brazil to the later 2027.\nJennifer Rumsey: 2027 through 2029. Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAngel Castillo: Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong quarter. I was hoping we could just unpack a little bit more the engine segment. You raised the outlook there on margins, and you've been talking about medium duty, but just as we think about your second half that is expected to decelerate on the heavy-duty side, can you talk about the components driving your margin improvement there? And just helping us kind of quantify what's ultimately driving that and how are you thinking about kind of 2025 margin improvement?\nMark Smith: Yeah. So we've got a little bit of help. We've improved the parts outlook. So that certainly helps overall -- we've been taking some measured actions across the company since the second half of fourth quarter of last year into the fourth quarter -- into the first quarter of this year, those should help with some lower costs in the second half of the year. And then we've got a stronger outlook in medium-duty truck. So those are really the three key elements. We're not going to get into breaking down the profitability by us. Those are really the three things that have helped improve. Yeah, and I think the conversion on the volume and the second quarter showed us there's still more room for improvement just in general operating efficiencies. No real change in -- in pricing most of the segments.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Raso: Hi. Thank you my question is on the guide. One area little skeptical on -- one area where it seems like you have some upside. The engine business, the second half of the year, you're guiding the revenues down only 3% year-over-year. And I'm just trying to go through heavy truck builds down double digit or the parts business mutes that. The light duty has the soft fourth quarter on the model change. Off-highway, comp fees, China a little better but big declines in Ag and some in construction. So I'm trying to understand why the revenue going down 3%? Or is it there's enough new penetration of customers that can push against all that, and at the same time, the engine margins only go down 30 bps sequentially on lower revs. And then the upside is PowerGen revenue growth less than 5% year-over-year in the second half, you're up over 6% in the first half. And the margins are down sequentially, I mean I understand the industrial piece within power can be down, but at least there are comp fees. So I'm just trying to understand, I assume PowerGen has a little more focus, a little more capacity, right, being pushed at minimum, good pricing. So again, why the -- or maybe it's just conservative, conservative on PowerGen, and if you can make us more comfortable on that engine? Thank you.\nMark Smith: Thanks, David. Good question. So I think on Power Systems, I don't think there's any fundamental changes. So it's really a key like how much do we -- how much product do we deliver to our customers and the conversion. We've given a range of outcomes for the margin. The business is performing well. And quite frankly, we're raising capacity. So I don't think the sales will go a lot above, but yet we're leaning on the profitability strongly, the business is really doing well. So I don't think there's much to be concerned about there, and we've raised the outlook. On the engine business, I think what's helping mitigate the margins, which is, I guess, the most important part is really some of the cost reduction actions that we've taken during the year, slightly better outlook for parts. And then there's just some of the puts and takes on the revenue. But those are the reasons why the margins at those revenue levels, we expect to hold up. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nTami Zakaria: Hi, good morning. Very nice quarter. I have two quick clarification questions. One is on the distribution segment. I think margins were lower, but sales were great. So is that margin guide prudently conservative? Or is this a function of the mix headwind from PowerGen? Or is there anything I need to be aware of for that? And then the other question is on price costs. I think you just said price still you expect 2.5% at the enterprise level. Since some of the raw material prices are coming down, do you expect some improvement in price cost for the year?\nMark Smith: So to the latter, not significantly, we've probably got about 50 basis points of cost headwind across all the different categories, varies by business and segment. And then on distribution, you're right to point out the margins. So there's really -- yes, for distribution, PowerGen is a little bit dilutive relative to the rest of the segment, even though obviously within Power Systems, its very accretive. So that's true. We've called that out. Also in the first and the second quarter, there was some modest individual charges that didn't merit to be called out in the overall results. So I don't merit a lot of commentary, but just say they've trimmed the margins a little bit. And, therefore, we're really just reflecting where we are for the year. We do believe distribution margins have still got significant potential to improve over time, so that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Thein: Hi. Good morning. I'll maybe combine these before I get the hook. Actually both pertaining to the North America heavy-duty segment. And the first part is just around market shares, Mark. Obviously, those can and do shift around quarter-to-quarter. And I'm just thinking big picture as we get in a softer back half of the year where the sleeper segment likely is disproportionately impacted from a production standpoint at the expense of vocational. I would imagine that favors Cummins from a share perspective, just absent any kind of specific OEM programs and other factors. So, maybe just your thoughts on that. And then the second part is just on the parts business, obviously, has been kind of a choppy past few quarters, but the commentary seems to be more positive, whereas some of the dealers and OEMs that have reported recently have flagged softness there. So I'm just curious, is that just kind of an absence of customer destocking that you went through last year or better just fleet utilization? What's driving that? If you can things. Thank you.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. And as you noted, I mean, we work to create customer pull for the heavy-duty product across different segments. But generally, as you said, for the vocational segment, we have stronger customer pull compared to the truckload, and that's the portion of the market that's been stronger right now. But of course, our goal is always to have the best product and create demand for Cummins products. But as you see that shift between the different segments of market and what OEMs are doing around incentives that could -- as well as capacity that can shift around a little bit over time. On the parts, it's somewhat demand driven and also this inventory destocking was a pretty big factor. There was a focused effort last year to reduce some of the inventory levels that have been carried because of the disruptions that we were all seeing and coming back down to more normal inventory levels. It was a little bit hard to separate between destocking and demand in the market. And so now you see us settling into what we see as pretty steady and solid demand in both our on- and off-highway markets.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks. Maybe hoping to get an update on demand in the order books for the X15? And how is it looking for the back half? How is it tracking the expectations and basically what's the response so far from the OEs?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. No, we are launching that product this month. with PACCAR excited to get it out in the market and then we'll launch it next year with DTNA, so have more offering there. We've got some early demand from some of the big fleet customers that have sustainability goals in the market, and we'll see how that develops over time, really with those fleet and other customers. And so we've projected we could get up to about 8% in the market, but I think it's going to take some time for us to get up to that. that level and for that market to develop in these operating costs and sustainability goals to drive demand up.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the engine slowdown that you're projecting for the second half of the year and maybe try and carry this into early 2025 because I think there's a perception that we're weak for a quarter or two and then the pre-buy kicks in and we're off to the races. When do you believe we start to show positive comparisons potentially in North American engines? And then we have an election this November, and I don't really know which way it's going, but just any thoughts on how a Republican victory or a Democratic victory might change the outlook for engines or new power?\nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So in terms of the heavy-duty demand, we all wish we had a crystal ball that could project how this is going to play out. This cycle has been very different than past cycles because of the pent-up demand that we had seen and then, of course, getting into pre-buy expectations. So it's really difficult to predict at what point next year we'll start to see improvement and economic conditions will certainly play a role in that. So I'm not going to project exactly when, but I think at some point in next year, we'll see recovery. And we've taken the steps to be prepared for that softening over the next few quarters. In terms of the election, again, I'm not going to make a prediction on that one either. What I will say is, as always, we worked in the past with the Trump administration, and we worked with the Biden administration. We worked across party lines to make sure that the opportunities and the challenges in our industry are understood and that regulation and policy reflects appropriately what those are. We will continue to do that in particular with the regulations that are in front of us. and our destination strategy at its core is about recognizing the economic importance of commercial and industrial applications and a need to decarbonize that industry over time and how do you take the appropriate steps to regulation and incentives to do that. So we're going to continue advocate for that. And some of the money that has come out of the inflation production Act has been allocated and is flowing into the market and creating jobs across the United States. So we'll continue to do that [indiscernible] those points and the opportunities and challenges that we're facing and how we navigate the energy transition. I think Cummins is really well positioned, regardless of how that plays out, but the industry, of course, is making investments in preparing for that. And so we want to make sure that we have stability and regulation, most importantly.\nMark Smith: And I just -- I know there's a lot of questions about heavy duty. But as we mentioned earlier, the demand for medium duty is getting stronger. We're actually investing to raise capacity over time, partly because of the strength of the market part because of the new business we've won. So right now, the expectation is that less volatility and a sustained high demand is what we're being told right now. Things can change based on the economy. But there's more question marks about heavy. Clearly, it's going down in the near-term and a lot less questions about medium duty for now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Kyle Menges with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nKyle Menges: Thank you. I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the power systems and really focus on the unit outlook and how to think about capacity for the remainder of the year and then how you think about you could exit the year from a capacity standpoint or just doing the math, it seems like. And assuming you're running pretty hot from a capacity standpoint, it seems like unit shipments capacity for the year would be around 20,000 or so units. I'm curious what that might look like the capacity on an annualized basis exiting the year and looking into 2025 with some of the investments you're making?\nMark Smith: Well, there's a lot of there, unfortunately, in that business, there's more variation, right? There's just such a wide range of engines and applications. And so it's not a -- unfortunately, it's not a simple explanation as it would be, say, for on-highway markets where there's a narrower range of products across the market. I don't think there's going to be dramatic capacity increases this year, but we're working towards, obviously, supporting the one key global secular theme, which is the data center capacity, Jenny Bush talked about at Analyst Day. That's the one. It varies by segment, some of our more consumer-facing segments demand has dropped over the last 18 months. So there's some more capacity there. So it very much depends by end market. But the general theme is some investment in capacity, some reorganizing where we make product around the world. We feel confident about the revenue guide for this year. We feel confident we can support through our production revenue going into next year. But unfortunately, I just because of the variation in the products, the pricing, the applications that like a rule of thumb on the unit isn't quite as applicable in that segment.\nJennifer Rumsey: Yeah. The only thing I'll add to Mark's comments, which are absolutely accurate is, in particular, the data center market. What you've seen happen in the first half of the year was we worked really hard on our supply base and production and the 95 liter, which is running now at capacity, and then we launched the Symptoms product, which adds -- adds additional platforms, including a 78-liter that's able to run at this 3-megawatt key data center point. And so helped us the supply chain improvement as well as the new product launches helped us increased revenue and what we're selling into the market. But we're continuing to run into capacity constraints on some of the platforms in that data center market, in particular, which is why we're making some modest investments to be able to take up capacity over the next couple of years.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Clulow for any closing remarks.\nChris Clulow: Thanks, everybody, for participating today. That concludes it for today. As always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions further after the call and throughout the rest of the week. Thank you. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong results in the second quarter. Given the strength of those results and our improved outlook, we've raised the midpoint of our full year expectations for 2024. Second quarter revenues were $8.8 billion, up 2% from a year ago, as organic growth more than offset the reduction in sales driven by the separation of Atmus. Sales in North America increased 4%, while international revenues decreased 2%. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted sales by 1%. EBITDA was $1.35 billion or 15.3% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.3 billion or 15.1% a year ago. The year ago numbers included $23 million of costs related to the separation of apps. The benefits of higher volumes and pricing as well as the absence of the separation costs were the primary drivers behind the improved profitability. Now I'll go into a little more detail by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.19 billion or 24.9% of sales compared to $2.15 billion or also 24.9% a year ago. Flat margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, offset by the removal of Atmus and higher compensation expenses. Selling, admin, and research expenses were $1.21 billion or 13.7% of sales compared to $1.26 billion or 14.6% last year. Joint venture income of $103 million decreased $30 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower technology fees and the weak domestic truck market in China. Other income was negative $3 million, a decrease of $27 million a year ago. Interest expense was $109 million, an increase of $10 million from prior year, primarily driven by higher weighted average interest rates. The all-in effective tax rate in the quarter was 23%, including $9 million or $0.07 per diluted share of favorable discrete tax items. All in net earnings for the quarter were $726 million or $5.26 per diluted share compared to $720 million or $5.05 per diluted share in Q2 last year. The second quarter reflected the lower weighted average share count as a result of the tax-free share exchange that there was the final separation of Atmus was completed in the first quarter. All-in, operating cash flow was an outflow of $851 million compared to an inflow of $483 million in the second quarter last year, and the decrease was driven mainly by the $1.9 billion payment required by the previously disclosed settlement agreements with the regulatory agencies. Excluding the settlement, operating cash flow was an inflow of $1.1 billion, more than double the cash generated in the second quarter last year. I will now comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, guidance for 2024 includes the operations Atmus in our consolidated results up until the full separation that occurred on March 18th. Components segment revenue was $3 billion, a decrease of 13% from the prior year, while EBITDA decreased from 14.2% of sales to 13.6%, with both sales and EBITDA primarily impacted by the Atmus separation. For Components, we expect 2024 revenues to decrease 9% to 14%, consistent with our prior projections and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%, narrowing the range from our previous guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. For the Engine segment, second quarter revenues were a record $3.2 billion, an increase of 5% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.1%, a slight decrease from 14.2% a year ago. As the benefit from pricing and record on-highway volumes in North America was offset by higher research costs and lower joint venture income, primarily in China. In 2024, we now project 2024, we now project -- for the full year sorry, we now project revenues for the Engine business to be down 3% to up 2%, an increase of 2% from the prior midpoint, driven by a revised outlook in the North American medium-duty truck market. Full year Engine EBITDA is projected to be in the range of $13.7 million to $14.2 million, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint from our prior projections due to higher volumes and ongoing operational efficiencies. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 9% from a year ago to a record $2.8 billion. EBITDA as a percent of sales decreased to 11.1% compared to 11.4% a year ago, primarily due to higher compensation expenses and a higher mix of power generation sales, which are positive for the company overall, but have a dilutive impact on the Distribution segment margins. We now expect 2024 Distribution revenues to be up 5% to 10%, an increase of 5% from the prior midpoint, mainly due to stronger power generation markets. And we've revised our EBITDA margin expectations to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.8%, down a little from our prior range of 11.5% to 12.5%. Results for the Power Systems segment set a new quarterly record. Revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 9% and EBITDA increased from 13.8% and to 18.9%, driven by higher volumes, particularly in power generation markets, improved pricing and other operational improvements and cost reduction. For 2024, we expect Power Systems revenues to be up 3% to 8%, an increase of 3% from the prior year guide. EBITDA is now projected to be approximately 17.5% to 18% and up from the previous projections of 16% to 17%. Accelera revenues increased 31% to $111 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $117 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $114 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support those parts of the business where strong growth is expected, whilst reducing costs in areas where we accept the prospects for growth have extended into the future. In 2024, we expect Accelera revenues to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million, down $50 million from our prior guide. Net losses are still expected to be in the range of $400 million to $430 million. As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the second quarter and the revised outlook in our key region end markets, we have raised our full year company guidance. We now expect revenues to be down 3% to flat, which is better than our previous guidance of down 2% to down 5%. EBITDA margins are now projected to be approximately 15% to 15.5%, narrowing the range and increasing the midpoint 25 basis points from our prior guide. Our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% in 2024, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, unchanged from three months ago, as we continue make critical investments in new products and capacity expansion to support future growth. In summary, we delivered record sales and solid profitability in the second quarter of 2024. We still do expect some moderation in some key markets in the second half of the year, especially North American heavy-duty truck, as we pointed out at our recent Analyst Day also. We've taken some cost to reduce -- we took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forward, leaving us well-positioned to navigate any economic cyclicality that we may experience. We continue to deliver strong financial results raising our performance cycle over cycle while still investing for future growth. Our priorities for this year for capital allocation remain to reinvest for growth, increase the dividend, and reduce debt. Overall, a very strong quarter. Thanks for your time today. Now, let me turn it back over to Chris. Okay. Good questions. We'll try and fit in our answers with the time available for us this evening. On Power Systems, there's really three elements to the margins. And to answer the last part of your question, yes, we do expect there's still more to come. So, the team there is doing a fantastic job, started with some cost reduction, reprioritizing where we're where we're investing, investing less, strong pricing environment on the Power Systems side and then yes, there's more to do on the operational efficiency. So really, it's several strings to the bow in terms of what's been driving the results and still more to come. So we're really, really excited. Hopefully, you felt the confidence from Jenny Bush and to the team from the Analyst Day and have continued to deliver here in the second quarter, and we're bullish on that segment. That's -- those are really the main drivers on Power Systems. Yes. Great questions. So on average, across the company, very, very much by segment, but 2.5% for the year, and that really hasn't changed. That's not changed in the results, but it definitely has been an important driver of the Power Systems results. And I don't think it's going to vary a lot that year-over-year increase should mostly hold across all the quarters. In India and Brazil to the later 2027. Yeah. So we've got a little bit of help. We've improved the parts outlook. So that certainly helps overall -- we've been taking some measured actions across the company since the second half of fourth quarter of last year into the fourth quarter -- into the first quarter of this year, those should help with some lower costs in the second half of the year. And then we've got a stronger outlook in medium-duty truck. So those are really the three key elements. We're not going to get into breaking down the profitability by us. Those are really the three things that have helped improve. Yeah, and I think the conversion on the volume and the second quarter showed us there's still more room for improvement just in general operating efficiencies. No real change in -- in pricing most of the segments. Thanks, David. Good question. So I think on Power Systems, I don't think there's any fundamental changes. So it's really a key like how much do we -- how much product do we deliver to our customers and the conversion. We've given a range of outcomes for the margin. The business is performing well. And quite frankly, we're raising capacity. So I don't think the sales will go a lot above, but yet we're leaning on the profitability strongly, the business is really doing well. So I don't think there's much to be concerned about there, and we've raised the outlook. On the engine business, I think what's helping mitigate the margins, which is, I guess, the most important part is really some of the cost reduction actions that we've taken during the year, slightly better outlook for parts. And then there's just some of the puts and takes on the revenue. But those are the reasons why the margins at those revenue levels, we expect to hold up. Next question please. So to the latter, not significantly, we've probably got about 50 basis points of cost headwind across all the different categories, varies by business and segment. And then on distribution, you're right to point out the margins.

So I don't merit a lot of commentary, but just say they've trimmed the margins a little bit. And, therefore, we're really just reflecting where we are for the year. We do believe distribution margins have still got significant potential to improve over time, so that's what's going on. And I just -- I know there's a lot of questions about heavy duty. But as we mentioned earlier, the demand for medium duty is getting stronger. We're actually investing to raise capacity over time, partly because of the strength of the market part because of the new business we've won.

            "content": "Thank you, Chris and good morning. I'm excited to be with all of you today as I celebrate my two-year anniversary of becoming CEO of Cummins. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results. Then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our second quarter financial performance and our forecast for the year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major accomplishments from the second quarter. At our recent Analyst Day, I shared that we are raising our long-term financial targets as a result of our of our strengthening portfolio and continued execution our Destination Zero strategy. The strong partnerships that we have with customers and stakeholders are key to driving our strategy and growth profile forward. In this quarter, we strengthened those partnerships even further. In May, we announced with Isuzu Motors Limited the launch of a new 6.7-liter engine designed for use in Isuzu medium-duty truck lineup. This engine will power on-highway truck applications for the Japan market and will be available for Asia-Pacific markets and other global markets later this year. We also announced plans to launch a battery electric powertrain for Isuzu's F-Series in North America. Availability of the medium-duty truck is expected in 2026 and will include Accelera's next-generation lithium-ion phosphate or LFP battery technology. These advancements mark an important milestone for both Cummins and Isuzu as Cummins enters the Japan on-highway market for the first time in our history. We are proud of the partnership our two companies have built, and I'm excited to leverage our collective strength and scale to deliver profitable growth for both partners. Also this quarter, we further progressed our partnership with Daimler Trucks and buses and PACCAR as we completed the formation of joint venture now known as Amplify Cell Technologies, to localize battery cell production in the in the battery supply chain the United States. This included naming the Chief Executive Officer of joint venture and breaking ground at a new manufacturing plant in Marshall County, Mississippi. Amplify Cell Technologies will enable Accelera by Cummins and our partners to advance battery cells focused on commercial and industrial applications in North America and serve our customers' evolving needs. This is a significant step forward as we continue leading our industry into the next era of smarter, cleaner power. And in July, Accelera was awarded $75 million from the Department of Energy to convert approximately 360,000 square feet of existing manufacturing space at our Columbus, Indiana engine plant for zero emissions components, including battery packs and electric powertrain systems. The $75 million grant is the largest federal grant ever awarded solely to Cummins and as part of the appropriations related to the inflation Reduction Act. The Columbus engine plant is also where we manufacture blocks and heads for our current and next-generation engine-based solutions, further showcasing our Destination Zero strategy in action. Now, I will comment on the overall company performance for the second quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets, starting with North America before moving on to our largest international markets. Demand for our products remain strong across many of our key markets and regions, resulting in record revenues the second quarter of 2024. Sales for the quarter were $8.8 billion, an increase of 2% compared to the second quarter of 2023, driven by continued high demand and improved pricing. EBITDA was $1.35 billion or 15.3% compared to $1.3 billion or 15.1% a year ago. Second quarter 2023 results included $23 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. EBITDA and gross margin dollars improved compared to the second quarter of 2023 as the benefits of higher volume and pricing exceeded supply chain cost increases and offset the impact of the Atmus separation. Our second quarter revenues in North America grew 4% to $5.5 billion, driven by the strong demand in our core markets more than offsetting the impact of the separation of Atmus. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the second quarter were 75,000 units, up 1% from 2023 levels. While our heavy-duty unit sales were 31,000, up 7% from a year ago. The second quarter marked record production volume for our heavy-duty engines at the Jamestown Engine plant. Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the second quarter of 2024, an increase of 4% from 2023 levels, while our unit sales were 38,000, up 13% and also outpacing the market growth. We shipped 41,000 engines to Stellantis for using the Ram pickups in the second quarter of 2024, up 8% from 2023. Revenues in North America power generation increased by 23% and driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. The impressive power generation performance in North America and across the globe helped us achieve record sales and profitability in the Power Systems segment. Our second quarter international revenues decreased 2% compared to last year. Second quarter in China, including joint venture, were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 2% as weaker domestic volumes were partially offset with higher data center demand. Industry demand for medium and heavy-duty trucks in China was 270,000 units, a decrease of 3% from last year. Demand in the China truck market continues to run at low levels with higher orders for natural gas engines and strong exports offsetting weak domestic diesel demand. In light-duty market in China, we were up 4% from 2023 levels at 480,000 units while our units sold, including joint ventures, were $33,000, an increase of 18%. The industry demand for excavators in China in the second quarter was 53,000 units, an increase of 4% from 2023 levels. Our units sold were 10,000 units, an increase of 19% as a result of QSM15 penetration at both new and existing OEM partners and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China increased 36% in the second quarter, primarily driven by accelerating demand in data centers. This helped drive impressive financial performance at our Cummins Chongqing joint venture within our Power Systems business. Second quarter revenues in India, including joint venture, were $649 million, a decrease of 10% from the second quarter a year ago. Industry truck production increased by 11% and while our shipments increased by 5%. Power Generation revenues decreased by 17% year-on-year as the second quarter of 2023 benefited from pre-buy demand ahead of emissions regulation changes. Now, let me provide our outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets. We have raised our expectations for 2024, while still anticipating the second half to be weaker than the first half, primarily in the North America heavy-duty truck market. We are increasing our revenue guidance to down 3% to flat compared to our prior guidance of down 2% to down 5%. We are also increasing our EBITDA guide to be 15% to 15.5%, compared to our prior guide of 14.5% to 15.5%. We now expect higher revenue in our Engine, Power Systems and Distribution segments, offsetting slightly lower revenue expectations for the Accelera business. We also expect stronger profitability in our Engine and Power Systems segments, driving most of the improvement in EBITDA. We are maintaining our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to be 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024 as we still expect softening in the second half of the year. In the North America medium-duty truck market, we are raising our forecast to be 150,000 to 160,000 units, flat to up 5% from 2023. This is an increase from our previous guidance by 10,000 units as we continue to benefit from an elevated backlog and strength in vocational orders. Consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 in 2024, with a planned model year changeover likely to drive a temporary dip in production in the second half. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 8% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand. We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to expect slightly weaker property investment and slowing export demand in China. We are raising our guidance for the global power generation market to be up 15% to 20% compared to our prior guidance of up 10% to 15%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with our prior guidance. For aftermarket, we have improved our guidance to flat to up 5% for 2024, raising the bottom end of our previous guidance of a decline of 5%, with demand holding up better than expected in on- and off-highway markets. In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $400 million to $450 million, a reduction of $50 million from the prior guide. As we noted at our Analyst Day, the energy transition is progressing more slowly, impacting both our e-mobility and electrolyzer revenues. In summary, coming off a strong first half of the year, we are raising our guidance on sales to down 3% to flat and raising our EBITDA guidance to 15% to 15.5%. While we anticipate softening in the North America heavy-duty market in the second half of the year, demand in several of our core markets remain strong. Should economic momentum slow, Cummins is in a strong position to keep investing in future growth, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash shareholders. In July, we announced an 8.3% increase in the quarterly dividend from $1.68 to $1.82 per share, the 15th consecutive year in which we have increased the dividend. During the quarter, we returned $230 million to shareholders in the form of dividends consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to our shareholders. Our diluted earnings per share benefited from a lower number of shares outstanding with the impact of the Atmus split more fully reflected in the weighted average share count in the second quarter. In summary, we had a strong performance in the first half of 2024, driven by record demand for Cummins products in our core markets. It is exciting to see our business grow with long-established customers in existing markets and to see newer partnerships yield additional opportunities in previously untapped markets for Cummins. I'm grateful for our employees who continue to execute on our strategy and deliver solutions that help our customers win wherever they operate. Our results reflect our dedication to delivering strong financial performance while also investing in our future growth, bringing sustainable solutions to decarbonize our industry and returning cash to our shareholders. As we discussed at Analyst Day, there is a lot to be excited about in our future. Now let me turn it over to Mark. Yes. Thanks for the question, Steven. Good morning. We've seen pretty consistent performance out of China and the economic conditions over the last 18 to 24 months, and there's been previous indications of actions the government may take, none of which has really translated into any meaningful change in our industry. So, really, we're seeing the strong performance still with natural gas product an export and a relatively weak domestic diesel market and are not anticipating that changing in the near-term. Yes. On the market outlook, what I would say is in the power gen market, the continued growth that we see there, in particular the data center, I don't see that letting up anytime soon, and where we have strong demand, high backlog. And as you know, we talked about in May, making some capacity investments to take advantage of the growing market there. In US on-highway, the medium-duty truck has continued to be strong. We see strong backlog and demand and don't see that letting up in the foreseeable future. and heavy duty, we do see build rates coming down, projecting about 10% down in the third quarter and 20% overall for the second half of year. And the question is what will happen next year with the broader economic environment because well stabilized spot rates and these truck prices are at a lower level than they've been historically, and that's impacted some of our customers demand. And so how that comes together with a pre-buy. The Supreme Court overturning of the Chevron deference, we don't anticipate any impacting regulations in the near-term. We believe that 2027 regulations will continue to move forward. And probably the bigger question is what we see with Phase 3 greenhouse gas in the 2030 time frame. And so we still anticipate some amount of pre-buy ahead of that emissions changeover. But the industry has also demonstrated there's capacity constraints that we've seen in the last couple of years. So how large that pre-buy will be, I think is still question, but we're preparing to have strong demand as we go into the 2027 regulation change. Thank you. Yeah, sure. So you've seen this trend and some of the announcement that we made over the last few years playing out now as regulations start to occur. So we're seeing growing medium-duty demand in the US, of course, with Daimler transitioning to us and us as well as some other customers like keno here in the US. So we're growing our position in the medium-duty market here. We've now launched the medium-duty product in India with Daimler. So we'll start to see some volume there. Their strategy is really driven by regulation change. So when you see regulation change in Europe and Brazil will continue to grow volume with Daimler. On the Isuzu business, we are building that new B6.7 and their Tohoku plant in Japan. So we're not importing that engine. We're building it in the market. First time we've been on-highway market, we've been in the off-highway market there, of course, for many years. And so we'll see some slow volume growth there in Japan. And then as I noted, they'll then launch that truck into other Asia Pacific and global markets later this year. So you're just going to see steady growth, I would say, from Cummins year-over-year in the medium-duty space as these new customer partnerships grow and emissions regulations change and ads. 2027 through 2029. Yeah. Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. And as you noted, I mean, we work to create customer pull for the heavy-duty product across different segments. But generally, as you said, for the vocational segment, we have stronger customer pull compared to the truckload, and that's the portion of the market that's been stronger right now. But of course, our goal is always to have the best product and create demand for Cummins products. But as you see that shift between the different segments of market and what OEMs are doing around incentives that could -- as well as capacity that can shift around a little bit over time. On the parts, it's somewhat demand driven and also this inventory destocking was a pretty big factor. There was a focused effort last year to reduce some of the inventory levels that have been carried because of the disruptions that we were all seeing and coming back down to more normal inventory levels. It was a little bit hard to separate between destocking and demand in the market. And so now you see us settling into what we see as pretty steady and solid demand in both our on- and off-highway markets. Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. No, we are launching that product this month. with PACCAR excited to get it out in the market and then we'll launch it next year with DTNA, so have more offering there. We've got some early demand from some of the big fleet customers that have sustainability goals in the market, and we'll see how that develops over time, really with those fleet and other customers. And so we've projected we could get up to about 8% in the market, but I think it's going to take some time for us to get up to that. that level and for that market to develop in these operating costs and sustainability goals to drive demand up. Yes. So in terms of the heavy-duty demand, we all wish we had a crystal ball that could project how this is going to play out. This cycle has been very different than past cycles because of the pent-up demand that we had seen and then, of course, getting into pre-buy expectations. So it's really difficult to predict at what point next year we'll start to see improvement and economic conditions will certainly play a role in that. So I'm not going to project exactly when, but I think at some point in next year, we'll see recovery. And we've taken the steps to be prepared for that softening over the next few quarters. In terms of the election, again, I'm not going to make a prediction on that one either. What I will say is, as always, we worked in the past with the Trump administration, and we worked with the Biden administration. We worked across party lines to make sure that the opportunities and the challenges in our industry are understood and that regulation and policy reflects appropriately what those are. We will continue to do that in particular with the regulations that are in front of us. and our destination strategy at its core is about recognizing the economic importance of commercial and industrial applications and a need to decarbonize that industry over time and how do you take the appropriate steps to regulation and incentives to do that. So we're going to continue advocate for that. And some of the money that has come out of the inflation production Act has been allocated and is flowing into the market and creating jobs across the United States. So we'll continue to do that [indiscernible] those points and the opportunities and challenges that we're facing and how we navigate the energy transition. I think Cummins is really well positioned, regardless of how that plays out, but the industry, of course, is making investments in preparing for that. And so we want to make sure that we have stability and regulation, most importantly. Yeah. The only thing I'll add to Mark's comments, which are absolutely accurate is, in particular, the data center market. What you've seen happen in the first half of the year was we worked really hard on our supply base and production and the 95 liter, which is running now at capacity, and then we launched the Symptoms product, which adds -- adds additional platforms, including a 78-liter that's able to run at this 3-megawatt key data center point. And so helped us the supply chain improvement as well as the new product launches helped us increased revenue and what we're selling into the market. But we're continuing to run into capacity constraints on some of the platforms in that data center market, in particular, which is why we're making some modest investments to be able to take up capacity over the next couple of years."

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chris Clulow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Chris. You may begin. \nChristopher Clulow: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our teleconference today to discuss Cummins results for the first quarter of 2024. Participating with me today are Jennifer Rumsey, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Smith, our Chief Financial Officer. We will all be available to answer questions at the end of the teleconference. \n Before we start, please note that some of the information that you will hear or be given today will consist of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Such statements express our forecasts, expectations, hopes, beliefs and intentions on strategies regarding the future.  \n Our actual future results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties. More information regarding such risks and uncertainties is available in the forward-looking disclosure statement in the slide deck and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  \n During the course of this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, and we'll refer you to our website for the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP financial measures. Our press release with a copy of the financial statements and a copy of today's webcast presentation are available on our website within the Investor Relations section at cummins.com. With that out of the way, I will turn you over to our Chair and CEO, Jennifer Rumsey to kick us off. \nJennifer Rumsey: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, and then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter.\n In March, Cummins successfully completed the separation of our Filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies. Cummins will continue its focus on advancing innovative power solutions, while Atmus is now well positioned to pursue its own plans for profitable growth. We are proud of our employees' hard work and all who were involved to ensure successful separation, and we are excited to see what the future holds for both Cummins and Atmus. The final step in the separation of Atmus resulted in a tax-free exchange of shares, which reduced Cummins shares outstanding by 5.6 million.  \n In addition, we reintroduced our fuel-agnostic platforms with the name that captures the innovation that powers us forward, Cummins HELM platform. With higher efficiency, lower emissions and multiple fuels, the Cummins HELM platforms give our customers control of how they navigate their own journeys as part of the energy transition.  \n As the next product in the Cummins HELM 15-liter platform, we announced we will launch the next-generation diesel X15 in North America for the heavy duty on-highway market, which will be compliant with the U.S. EPA and CARB 2027 aligned regulations at launch. \n Lastly, in April, Cummins Power Generation introduced 4 new generator sets to the award-winning Centum Series, powered by Cummins QSK50 and QSK78 engines. These new models have been engineered specifically for the most critical applications such as data centers, health care facilities and wastewater treatment plant.  \n I was excited to attend the launch event with our customers and hear about the growing demand for these critical applications and high interest in our genset products, which build on decades of experience meeting our customers' needs and deliver a step change improvement in power density, assured reliability, sustainability and low emissions. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets.  \n Demand for our products remained strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.4 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the first quarter of 2023. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% compared to $1.4 billion or 16.1% a year ago. \n First quarter 2024 results include a gain net of transaction costs and other expenses of $1.3 billion related to the Atmus divestiture and $29 million of restructuring expenses as we continue to work to simplify our operating structure and improve the efficiency of our business for the long term.  \n This compares to the first quarter 2023 results, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses, EBITDA percentage decreased by 80 basis points as improved pricing partially offset lower volumes and higher research and development expenses as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future.  \n Gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2023 as the benefits of pricing more than offset the impact of lower volumes and supply chain cost increases.\n Our first quarter revenues in North America were flat with 2023. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 73,000 units, down 5% from 2023 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 26,000, down 7% from 2023. \n Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 8%, while our unit sales were 36,000, up 22% from 2023. We shipped 38,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the Ram pickups in the first quarter of 2024, down 2% from the 2023 levels. \n Revenues for North America power generation increased by 21%, driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. Our international revenues decreased by 1% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a year ago. \n First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5% as weaker domestic volumes were partially offset with the accelerating data center demand. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 305,000 units, an increase of 14% from last year. However, shifts in the market share during the first quarter led to a decline in our volumes year-over-year. \n The light-duty market in China was up 2% from 2023 levels at 486,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 37,000, an increase of 3%. Industry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 50,000 units, a decrease of 13% from 2023 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to weak property investment, high equipment population and slowing export demand. Our units sold were 9,000 units, an increase of 10% as a result of the QSM15 penetration and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 7% in the first quarter as accelerating data center demand was offset by softening in other markets.  \n First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $758 million, an increase of 1% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production decreased by 7%, while our shipments decreased by 5% as the market slowed ahead of elections in April. Power generation revenues increased by 37% in the first quarter as economic activity remains strong. Now let me provide an outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets.  \n Our full year guidance now excludes Atmus from the March 18 separation date onwards and also include -- excludes the first quarter gain related to the divestiture. The guidance provided previously included Atmus for the full year as it preceded the transaction announcement. We are happy to share that our expectations for 2024 have improved from our initial guidance issued in February. Our forecast for total company revenue in 2024 remains the same at down 2% to 5%, which implies higher base business revenues of approximately $1.3 billion compared to our prior guidance as Atmus is now excluded from future quarters.  \n We are increasing our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024 compared to our prior guide of 245,000 to 265,000 units, though We do still expect softening in the second half of the year. \n In North America, medium-duty truck market, we maintain our prior guidance of 140,000 to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat from 2023, consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 in 2024, down 5% to 10% from 2023 as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance.  \n We project a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% in demand in the light-duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be in the range -- to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and potentially slower export demand. \n The short-term shifts in the market share that I noted earlier are expected to normalize as we progress through the remainder of the year. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand, consistent with our prior guidance.  \n We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, up from our previous guidance of down 5% to 15%. We continue to expect weak property investment and slowing export demand in China. We project our major global high-horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024.  \n We are raising our guidance for global power generation markets to be up 10% to 15% compared to our prior guidance of about 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. \n Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with our prior guidance. While a smaller market for us, we continue to anticipate demand for oil and gas engines to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America.  \n For aftermarket, we've maintained our guidance of down 5% to up 5% for 2024, as we are through the inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. \n In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $450 million to $500 million compared to $354 million in 2023, consistent with our prior guidance. We are ramping up electrolyzer manufacturing capacity and capability to deliver orders to our customers as well as expect continued growth in electrified components.  \n In summary, coming off a strong first quarter, we are maintaining our sales growth outlook for the year of down 2% to 5% as stronger demand in our base business has offset the removal of Atmus for future quarters from our guidance. We have also revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% compared to our previous guidance of 14.4% to 15.4%, reflecting stronger North America heavy-duty truck and power generation markets, which more than offsets the loss of profitability of Atmus.  \n In addition, we are taking steps to reduce cost, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. During the quarter, we returned $239 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders.  \n In addition, we reduced the overall Cummins share count by 5.6 million as we completed the Atmus share exchange, which will be more fully reflected in the average share count in the second quarter and beyond. \n I am impressed and grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world for delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Our results further enhance Cummins' ability to keep investing in the future growth, bringing sustainable solutions that will protect our planet for future generations and returning cash to our shareholders.  \n I look forward to discussing our long-term strategy further in our upcoming Analyst Day on May 16 and now let me turn it over to Mark. \nMark Smith: Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid first quarter revenue and profitability and generated positive operating cash flow. Given the strength of first quarter results and our improved outlook, we've raised our full year expectations for 2024 after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. First quarter revenues were $8.4 billion, down 1% from a year ago. The separation of Atmus in mid-March resulted in a year-over-year sales decline of around 1% to our -- to Cummins consolidated sales.\n Our underlying revenues increased in North America and Latin America and were offset by weaker demand in China and Europe. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% of sales for the quarter. We completed the tax-free full separation of Atmus in March, which resulted in a onetime gain on the divestiture of $1.3 billion, net of transaction costs and other expenses. First quarter results also included $29 million of restructuring expenses. This compares to first quarter of 2023, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. \n To provide clarity on operational performance and allow comparison to prior year, I am excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses in my following comments. Financial results of Atmus through March 18 are included in our first quarter consolidated sales and EBITDA. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.5% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.4 billion or 16.3% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percentage was driven by investment in new products and capabilities and lower sales volumes. \n Now let's look into more detailed by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 24.5% of sales compared to $2 billion or 24% even last year. The improved margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, especially in the Power Systems business. Selling, administrative and research expenses increased by $72 million, driven by higher research costs as we continue to bring to market new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth, particularly the development of the HELM product line within the Engine business. \n Joint venture income of $123 million increased $4 million from the prior year, primarily due to increased earnings in the Power Systems segment. Other income was $21 million, a decrease of $50 million from a year ago. The decrease in other income is driven by the relative negative impact of foreign currency revaluation and lower gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance compared to a year ago. Interest expense was $89 million, an increase of $2 million from the prior year, driven by higher outstanding, long-term borrowings related to the bond issuance we completed in February. \n The all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 8.7%, mainly due to the tax-free gain on the separation of Atmus. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $2 billion or $14.03 per diluted share, which includes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus of $1.3 billion or $9.08 per diluted share and restructuring expenses of $29 million or $0.15 per share. \n Just to reinforce what Jen said, full impact of the lower share count from the Atmus separation will be seen in future quarters since the diluted share counts counted on a weighted average basis. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $276 million compared to an inflow of $495 million in the first quarter last year. Now let me comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. \n As a reminder, prior guidance for 2024 assume that the operations of Atmus would be included in our consolidated results for the full year. Components segment revenue was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 6%, while EBITDA, excluding costs related to the separation of Atmus, increased from 14.6% of sales to 14.8% driven primarily by improved performance within Cummins [indiscernible]. For Components, we've updated the guidance for the segment following the separation of Atmus and expect 2024 revenues to decrease 9% to 14% and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%. \n Our latest guidance reflects an increase in both revenues and EBITDA margins after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, a decrease of 2% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.1%, a decrease from 15.3% a year ago as the benefit of pricing offset by lower volumes and higher research costs. 2024, we now project revenues for the Engine business to be down 5% to flat, an improvement of 2% at the midpoint from our prior year projections, reflecting a revised outlook in the North American truck markets and stronger-than-expected demand from our construction customers. \n 2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.7% to 13.7%, an increase of 20 basis points at the midpoint due to higher volumes. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 5% from a year ago to $2.5 billion. EBITDA decreased as a percent of sales to 11.6% compared to 13.9% of sales a year ago as aftermarket sales, particularly to industrial customers declined from the record levels that we experienced a year ago. \n We expect 2024 distribution revenues to be flat to up 5% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%, an increase from the prior guide of 3% for revenues and a modest improvement to margins for the full year. Power Systems segment revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 3% and EBITDA increased from 16.3% to 17.1% of sales driven by higher volumes, particularly in the power generation markets, improved pricing and operating improvements, all of which contributed to a strong trend of improving performance in that segment. \n 2024, we now expect Power Systems revenues to be flat to 5%, up 3% at the midpoint and EBITDA has also increased to be approximately 16% to 17%, up 80 basis points from our previous guide. Accelera revenues increased 9% to $93 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $101 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $94 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support future growth. \n In 2024, our guidance is unchanged. We expect revenues to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to be in the range of $400 million to $433 million consistent with our prior guide. \n As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the outlook in our key regions, end markets, we are adjusting the full year company guidance, and we project company revenue -- consolidated company revenues to be down 2% to 5%, consistent with the prior year guidance despite the separation of Atmus. \n Company EBITDA margins are now projected to be approximately 14.5% to 15.5%, up 10 basis points from prior guidance, all of which excludes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus and the restructuring expenses. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 24%, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, unchanged from our outlook 3 months ago as we continue to make critical investments in new products, capacity expansion to support future growth. \n In summary, we delivered solid sales, profitability and positive cash flow in the first quarter. We do still expect moderation in some of our key markets in the second half of 2024, but we have raised our expectations of our own performance relative to our prior guide. We took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forward leaving us well positioned to navigate any economic cyclicality and continue investing and delivering strong financial performance. \n Our priorities in 2024 for capital allocation are unchanged. We will reinvest for growth, plan to raise the dividend and reduce debt. Thank you for your interest today, and I look forward to seeing some of you in person in New York at our upcoming Analyst Day. \n Now let me turn it over to Chris. \nChristopher Clulow: Thank you, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for our first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Volkum (sic) [ Steve Volkmann ] with Jefferies. \nStephen Volkmann: I think I'd like to start off with power gen, if we could. That business seems to be going well. So sort of 2 things I'm curious to hear about exactly kind of what you think your position is in the data center market. How much of your business is data centers? \n And then how are you thinking about increasing capacity over the next, whatever, few quarters or years, however, that's going to play out? What should we be thinking about in terms of capacity additions and your ability to kind of grow that business over time? \nJennifer Rumsey: Great. Thanks, Steve. And as you heard in the guidance, we're projecting the power gen business to be up 10% to 15% for the year, and data center, mission-critical is really the driver of that. And we've had a very strong demand from data center customers, have had historically a strong position in that market, and that market is obviously growing. We're sold out on our 95-liter through 2025 right now. And I mentioned the launch of the new Centum product, which uses our 50 and 78-liter engine. So that's providing additional solution to those customers. And then, of course, we're continuing to look at capacity of the 95-liter and how we plan to support what we think will be continuing strong and growing market. \nStephen Volkmann: So sorry, do you have any concrete plans to increase capacity of 95 yet? Or is that still in process? \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, we do have concrete plans to increase the capacity that we have in place to-date for the 95-liter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. \nJerry Revich: I wonder if I just ask the cadence of earnings over the course of this year, nice to see an upwards revision to both top line and margins. Mark, can you just talk about where the quarter came in versus your expectations because obviously, the quarter was light versus where the consensus was set up, and I'm just wondering how the quarter developed versus your internal plan. And what's the cadence of the acceleration that you folks are seeing to raise the guidance higher? \nMark Smith: Yes. I think to be fair to everyone involved to all of you on that side of the fence and all of us here, there's a lot of moving parts with the separation of Atmus. So from my perspective, in total, we came in, in line with our expectations and when you adjust for the mid-quarter separation of Atmus, I think we're by and large in line. \n I would say, as someone pointed out, the Distribution business margins a little bit lower, certainly lower than last year. We see those at the bottom end of the range in Q1 and improving from here, largely driven by what we've seen as a pullback on parts sales, particularly in the industrial off-highway applications. \n So that's the 1 area. It's not new. It's been there for a couple of months, 2 quarters. But otherwise, I'd say we feel good about the gross margin improvement year-over-year. As you can see from our announcements and our comments, we're continuing to look at ways to streamline our organization, make us more efficient where we can. So overall, in line, Jerry, but expecting Distribution in particular to pick up in its margins going forward. \n We've always expected -- probably we were expecting this a little bit last year, to be fair, and it didn't materialize. But we are expecting heavy-duty truck production to decline in the third quarter, in particular, and you've probably heard that from other industry participants. I think the Engine business and Components will feel some of that in Q3, probably Q4 Power Systems and Distribution shouldn't see any significant volatility in revenues. \n And really, the momentum is to the up on Power Systems going forward and into next year, clearly. And Distribution. As you know, it's more than half parts and service and quite predictable and reliable. We just had a little bit of a mix shift with the lower parts, but we think that's temporary. \nJerry Revich: Super. And can I just ask from a bigger picture standpoint, so new regulations 2027 will have embedded warranties essentially. What does that mean for your parts market share. Is that an opportunity when that field population increases for you folks to have higher engine parts market share because of that warranty dynamic on the new regulations, how significant is that opportunity? \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean, as you noted, there's a requirement starting with the EPA 2027 regulations for longer emissions warranty for heavy-duty 10 years or 450,000 miles, most of that application is going to mile out. So it's essentially what our 5-year extended warranty that some customers are already purchasing. \n And then that will mean that everybody will need that warranty that will be embedded into pricing on those engine systems and then, of course, we'll drive customers to genuine part throughout that period, which will provide some further benefit to us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: I'm going to ask mine together because they're related. So and they're both around Power Systems. So I think in the guidance, you guys are embedding full year margins below 1Q levels. I think it's a lumpy business, but if I look back historically, it's more common that the second half is higher. And then similar question on growth, the comps [ reduced ] slightly in the second half, but your full year growth guidance is, for an outcome less than the growth you saw in the first quarter. So if you could address both of those items. \nMark Smith: We do tend to see some seasonality on revenue in the fourth quarter, a little bit in the second half. But I think the point of your question is essentially right, Nicole, there's positive momentum there. We've been raising the guidance as the performance is improving. \n There is some modest variation depending on how the parts flow in that business. But overall, our messages, we're confident in the business and the improvements that we have Jenny Bush and her team have really worked hard on over the last 18 months. And if we get more revenue, we're confident we'll be able to turn that in higher earnings. But there's nothing dramatically structurally different. Going forward, we expect improvement over time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Raso: May 16, the meeting, can you just give us some expectations around the meeting? I think particularly around the margins. I think people are just trying to figure out the operating leverage in the company in the last couple of years, maybe not quite the margins people were expecting. Even the guide today, it was nice to see the power gen margin increase. But overall, the relative increase in earnings relative to the increase implicit in the sales guide. Still not that tremendous. So I'm just curious if you can sort of tee up a little bit what should we expect May 16. not trying to steal the thunder of the meeting but just to level set... \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Well, obviously, I won't tell you what we're going to tell you specifically, but certainly, you can expect us to talk about overall strategy for the company where we think we're at against some of the 2030 goals that we shared in our last Analyst Day and certainly talking about revenue and margin expectations and what the drivers for that will be within that. So I think you'll hear more about that for sure, David, at our Analyst Day. \nDavid Raso: Okay. And 1 quick one. The JV income in the first quarter was up year-over-year, but you're still guiding the year down. And I'm just trying to make sure we know why is it down? Is it China not continuing some of the improvement? Is there other parts of the royalty income? I know it's a pretty lumpy line item within the JV income. If you can help us with that would be great. \nMark Smith: Yes. I think you're exactly right, David. There's really 2 moving parts of the operating performance, which generally tends to move in line or better than the market rate. And then we get very lumpy tech fees from the joint venture back to Cummins consolidated results as new products are launched and last year was a particularly strong period of new product launch, [indiscernible] certain development milestones. So the tech fees are going to be down, particularly in the Engine business primarily and that's offsetting any assumptions around the market growth. \n I will say it's -- there was some truck OEM build increases in the Q1, but that was more on expectations or hopes about going forward, we're still waiting for clearer signs of momentum as China, as you know, is the biggest driver of the earnings there. But it's really lower tech fees, which were a big at last year -- a little bit in components, mostly in the Engine business. \nChristopher Clulow: One quick add there, David. And we also have built in our plan the launch of the battery joint venture later on this year post approval. So that will have some losses as well as that comes back online in the second half. \nMark Smith: Which is embedded in Accelera. \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes, we're expecting that. We have final regulatory approval for that battery JV. So we're expecting that's going to start flowing in Q2. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Angel Castillo with Morgan Stanley. \nAngel Castillo Malpica: Just back to the Power Generation segment. I think you raised your guidance to 10% to 15% versus a 5% to 10% previously. Can you just talk about the price versus volume mix makeup of that versus prior expectations? Is this a matter of getting better production than you kind of anticipated? Or is pricing growing and just kind of what are you seeing from that perspective? \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So there's a couple of dynamics to keep in mind in that market. So first of all, as I articulated, the order board is pretty long. And so some of the work to improve price cost in response to inflation and performance of the business takes some time to play out. So we're starting to see stronger pricing leverage come into that market. And then we're continuing to, of course, drive improvements in the Power Systems business and efficiency in manufacturing and supply chain. And I noted the launch of the new products that we've also designed to be able to sell at some higher margins. So there are some favorable dynamics that have been happening in the power gen market compared to historically where we would have been in margin performance. \nAngel Castillo Malpica: That's very helpful. And along the lines of new products, just you talked about your X15 diesel engine that's coming out for kind of ahead of the emissions regulations. Can you give us a little bit more as to what you kind of expect in terms of guardrails around pricing and margin potential improvement. I know you typically run emission cycles when you get kind of the opportunity to reset and recover some of that margin. So as we think about maybe not necessarily specifically to any given year, but those projects -- or those products and kind of the implications to your price and margins as those get rolled out? \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So certainly, like in past emissions regulations, our goal is to deliver incremental value to the customer, to have margin improvement associated with that. You will see with the 27 EPA regulations, we already talked about the emissions warranty dynamic. You will also see added content, in particular, after-treatment system to meet those regulations has notable additional content. \n And then you will also have the warranty dynamic that we always have as we launch new products where we began at least to launch to accrue at a higher rate from a warranty perspective until the product is out in the market, and we've demonstrated warranty. So those are the moving parts that you'll see. We have not yet shared specific numbers on what we expect around exact pricing for those products. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan. \nTami Zakaria: So I wanted to understand the margin guide a little better. It seems like excluding Atmus, which probably -- which was a headwind separating that out is becoming a headwind, but you sort of raised the full year guide by about 10 basis points, expecting better margins in Engines and Power Systems. So just to get a sense of what's really driving this improved margin expectation? Is it higher volumes? Or is it more cost savings? Or is it more price/cost? So any color there would be helpful. \nMark Smith: Good question. You're right that the Atmus separation is a little bit dilutive to margins. So yes, good that you picked up on that. It's really volume and a little bit of cost reduction activity. Those are the 2 primary drivers. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius research. \nRobert Wertheimer: My question is going to be around your competitive positioning in the 2027 EPA from what you can see today. There's a bunch of questions we get on whether there's a prebuy on what the cost increase would be and maybe the warranty should be stripped out of that, I'm not sure. \n And there may also be more subtle things that you guys would understand better than most of us around how the standards can be met, whether having an additional nat gas where you guys do pretty well can offset other emissions and so forth. So that's the general question. Price increase, whether share gain and whether there's any subtleties around your mix in your early preparedness that will help you in 2027 transition? \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. And we are investing, as we've talked about in the new HELM engine platforms. And we're in a unique position because of our scale to continue to invest in what will be a market-leading engine solutions to meet those future regulations. \n And so we expect that, that will provide some advantage for us as we go into those regulations. There will be a dynamic we think that's going to play out in the '25 and '26 time period as end customers anticipate a major regulation change and what that will mean to them. \n And so we expect that's going to drive some things beyond the normal cycle in the U.S. truck market. And then as we go into 2017, there'll be some period of uptake, but we think we're well positioned. Obviously, our position in medium duty has continued to strengthen, and we'll have a next-generation 15-liter natural gas that will go into the market later this year that is of high interest to some of our customers that have sustainability ambitions and see this as the best way, most cost-effective and reliable way to meet those ambitions and then we'll have a new high-efficiency 15-liter platform and 10-liter platform as well. So we're excited about our position with those products and really focused on the execution of development and launching them into the market. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. \nNoah Kaye: Just sticking with the EPA 2027 for a minute here. If the final rules continue to provide nice crediting of hydrogen trucks. And just given your offerings in this space, wondering if you started to see more of a pickup for hydrogen fuel cell or whether most of sort of the Accelera inbounds at this point are primarily both. \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So if you look beyond even the '27 into the EPA announced the Phase 3 greenhouse gas regulation, which is going to really start to shape the industry as we get into 2030 and beyond, no major surprises for us with that regulation, but it is really an unprecedented level of ambition and assumptions around 0 emissions vehicle penetration. And so the industry and the government is going to have to work really closely together for that to be successful.\n So to your question, one of the things -- there are a few things that we're pleased about in the regulation. One is it actually recognizes hydrogen engines as a zero-emission solution. So we believe that, that will create a space for hydrogen fueled engine that hydrogen fuel cells still are a good solution over time, but the adoption rate on that is likely to be -- take some time, I would say. And then the EPA also did commit to work to streamline hybrid powertrain certification. So hybrid engines, we think, may be an attractive solution because the infrastructure availability is going to be a challenge. \n So that's another thing that we're looking at closely. So there's still some engine-based solutions. Yes, we're seeing an uptick today in more of the battery electric powertrain as I noted, and of course, electrolyzers, fuel cells are still at pretty low level. \nNoah Kaye: Yes, makes sense. And then you mentioned that you got regulatory approval for the JV. So just can you lay out for us kind of the game plan on how spending for the gigafactory should proceed over the next couple of years? And what you may be doing at this point in terms of lining up supply and demand for the factory, at least your [indiscernible] \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. I mean the partners have been working together ahead of getting the final regulatory approval we announced that we selected a site earlier this year. So we'll be -- we're getting a site ready in Mississippi, just outside of Memphis to kind of see and really starting the work to prepare for supply chain and building the plant. We -- now that we have regulatory approval, we believe we'll be able to close and finalize the entity in this quarter. \n And then we'll have phased investment as we build the plant and work towards start of production in 2027. And then we're, of course, sharing this investment of a 21-gigawatt hour plant across the partners and have this design that will allow us to phase in new lines and scale up the plant and production rates based on how we see the industry developing, and we're still feeling really good about how we're positioned in the market together with LFP cell that will be designed specifically for the commercial vehicle market and have the ability to leverage some of the incentive money that's available here to help enable adoption in our commercial vehicle market. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Truist Securities. \nJamie Cook: So sorry, I'm managing through like 7 calls. I hope this hasn't been asked. But Mark, the question is to you, I guess, understanding you have your guys' Analyst Day coming up this month. I'm just looking at Cummins and thinking, okay, perhaps there's a cost story there, you have market share gains that should be helping you maybe less spend on Accelera. I'm just wondering, as you think about margins over the medium term, do you think there's an opportunity to structurally improve incremental margins? Or as you think about sort of the next couple of years, it is more so taking these actions to hit Cummins' historic targeted incremental margins? \n And then my second question would be, and if this is addressed, I apologize. Can you just talk to the visibility you have across like in terms of backlog across your portfolio, in particular, for the engine side and the Power Systems side. \nMark Smith: So I heard you we will explicitly address incremental margins in May. You will not miss that for all who are asking, very appropriate, at center of mind -- or top of mind for us clearly. So you will hear that very, very shortly, I guess. \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. And Jamie, good to have you back. We're, of course, working and you're seeing the improvement in the Meritor business as we do the integration and Accelera as we ramp up. Revenue, we'll talk more about that. In terms of color on the market, we're seeing continued solid demand in the heavy-duty market because of the high backlogs that have been built up, still a lot of strength in the vocational market. \n Truckload's been down for some time. And so we are still anticipating and hearing from our OEM customers that second half will have some weakening, and that's baked into our revised guidance, which is down, but not as far down as previous guidance. Power gen, I noted earlier, we've sold out the 95-liter through '25. We're looking at capacity there and how we can take that up as well as with the new Centum launch, being able to sell some of our other engines into that market as well. \n So pretty -- really strong feeling very good about power gen, feeling good about medium-duty and vocational on-highway. It's really the -- it's the truckload, fleet customers in the heavy-duty market. That's the one that we're watching closely and still anticipating that it's going to soften before we enter the next uptick in their cycle. \nMark Smith: Yes. And then what you heard maybe earlier was some industry consensus building about '25 and '26 ahead of 2027. So our baseline assumption today is that this is not as sharp or as steep as normal cyclical downturn. That's an assumption, not a fact, but that's what we've baked into our outlook for this year. China is the 1 where we're still -- we're waiting for more momentum probably. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Kauffman: I was just curious your thoughts. It's apparent that the downturn, I think a lot of us feared in '24 on the heavy-duty engine side isn't going to be as bad as originally feared. I know ACT Research has taken up their forecast. You did mention some weakness beginning in 3Q, but are we taking from what would have been otherwise prebuy in '26 if we have a better '24? Or do you think the 2 are unrelated? \nJennifer Rumsey: I'm not sure that they're related. I mean, we're really watching what's going on with production rates with backlog with some of the spot rate dynamics in the market. And if you look at some of the freight carriers out there, they've been challenged now for the last 18 months. \n And so that's what's driving our outlook, but fair. I mean we -- because of the -- it's really the supply chain dynamic that has made this cycle so different and even unpredictable. It certainly held up better and longer than we had forecast, and we are still expecting to see some softening in the second half. \nJeffrey Kauffman: Well, congratulations. \nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Chad Dillard with Bernstein Research. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Federico filling in for Chad. I would like to double click on the R&D intensity and how to think about this on the medium-term basis. \nChristopher Clulow: Sorry, can you repeat that? I don't think we got the first part. \nUnknown Analyst: Sorry. We would like to double-click on the R&D intensity and how to think about this on a medium term basis. \nJennifer Rumsey: Yes. So we are -- as you know, we've taken up our R&D investments. We noted that in our comments because we're making investments, in particular in these new fuel-agnostic engine platform. So we're at an elevated level of R&D for those new platform investments. And those products are beginning to launch and really will launch through the '26 and '27 time period. And then, of course, we're at a period of investment in the Accelera business as we work to launch new products and ramp up revenue there as well. \nOperator: Thank you. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Chris Clulow for closing comments. \nChristopher Clulow: Thanks, everybody, for your participation today. That concludes our teleconference. Really appreciate the interest. And as always, the Investor Relations team will be available for questions after the call. Have a good day. \nJennifer Rumsey: Look forward to seeing many of you in person in a couple of weeks. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid first quarter revenue and profitability and generated positive operating cash flow. Given the strength of first quarter results and our improved outlook, we've raised our full year expectations for 2024 after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. First quarter revenues were $8.4 billion, down 1% from a year ago. The separation of Atmus in mid-March resulted in a year-over-year sales decline of around 1% to our -- to Cummins consolidated sales.\n Our underlying revenues increased in North America and Latin America and were offset by weaker demand in China and Europe. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% of sales for the quarter. We completed the tax-free full separation of Atmus in March, which resulted in a onetime gain on the divestiture of $1.3 billion, net of transaction costs and other expenses. First quarter results also included $29 million of restructuring expenses. This compares to first quarter of 2023, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of Atmus. \n To provide clarity on operational performance and allow comparison to prior year, I am excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses in my following comments. Financial results of Atmus through March 18 are included in our first quarter consolidated sales and EBITDA. EBITDA was $1.3 billion or 15.5% of sales for the quarter compared to $1.4 billion or 16.3% of sales a year ago. The lower EBITDA percentage was driven by investment in new products and capabilities and lower sales volumes. \n Now let's look into more detailed by line item. Gross margin for the quarter was $2.1 billion or 24.5% of sales compared to $2 billion or 24% even last year. The improved margins were primarily driven by favorable pricing and operational improvements, especially in the Power Systems business. Selling, administrative and research expenses increased by $72 million, driven by higher research costs as we continue to bring to market new products and capabilities to support future profitable growth, particularly the development of the HELM product line within the Engine business. \n Joint venture income of $123 million increased $4 million from the prior year, primarily due to increased earnings in the Power Systems segment. Other income was $21 million, a decrease of $50 million from a year ago. The decrease in other income is driven by the relative negative impact of foreign currency revaluation and lower gains on investments related to company-owned life insurance compared to a year ago. Interest expense was $89 million, an increase of $2 million from the prior year, driven by higher outstanding, long-term borrowings related to the bond issuance we completed in February. \n The all-in effective tax rate in the first quarter was 8.7%, mainly due to the tax-free gain on the separation of Atmus. All in, net earnings for the quarter were $2 billion or $14.03 per diluted share, which includes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus of $1.3 billion or $9.08 per diluted share and restructuring expenses of $29 million or $0.15 per share. \n Just to reinforce what Jen said, full impact of the lower share count from the Atmus separation will be seen in future quarters since the diluted share counts counted on a weighted average basis. All-in operating cash flow was an inflow of $276 million compared to an inflow of $495 million in the first quarter last year. Now let me comment on segment performance and our guidance for 2024. \n As a reminder, prior guidance for 2024 assume that the operations of Atmus would be included in our consolidated results for the full year. Components segment revenue was $3.3 billion, a decrease of 6%, while EBITDA, excluding costs related to the separation of Atmus, increased from 14.6% of sales to 14.8% driven primarily by improved performance within Cummins [indiscernible]. For Components, we've updated the guidance for the segment following the separation of Atmus and expect 2024 revenues to decrease 9% to 14% and EBITDA margins in the range of 13.5% to 14.5%. \n Our latest guidance reflects an increase in both revenues and EBITDA margins after adjusting for the separation of Atmus. For the Engine segment, first quarter revenues were $2.9 billion, a decrease of 2% from a year ago. EBITDA was 14.1%, a decrease from 15.3% a year ago as the benefit of pricing offset by lower volumes and higher research costs. 2024, we now project revenues for the Engine business to be down 5% to flat, an improvement of 2% at the midpoint from our prior year projections, reflecting a revised outlook in the North American truck markets and stronger-than-expected demand from our construction customers. \n 2024 EBITDA is projected to be in the range of 12.7% to 13.7%, an increase of 20 basis points at the midpoint due to higher volumes. In the Distribution segment, revenues increased 5% from a year ago to $2.5 billion. EBITDA decreased as a percent of sales to 11.6% compared to 13.9% of sales a year ago as aftermarket sales, particularly to industrial customers declined from the record levels that we experienced a year ago. \n We expect 2024 distribution revenues to be flat to up 5% and EBITDA margins to be in the range of 11.5% to 12.5%, an increase from the prior guide of 3% for revenues and a modest improvement to margins for the full year. Power Systems segment revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 3% and EBITDA increased from 16.3% to 17.1% of sales driven by higher volumes, particularly in the power generation markets, improved pricing and operating improvements, all of which contributed to a strong trend of improving performance in that segment. \n 2024, we now expect Power Systems revenues to be flat to 5%, up 3% at the midpoint and EBITDA has also increased to be approximately 16% to 17%, up 80 basis points from our previous guide. Accelera revenues increased 9% to $93 million, driven by increased electrolyzer installations. Our EBITDA loss was $101 million compared to an EBITDA loss of $94 million a year ago as we continue to invest in the products and capabilities to support future growth. \n In 2024, our guidance is unchanged. We expect revenues to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million and net losses to be in the range of $400 million to $433 million consistent with our prior guide. \n As Jen mentioned, given the strong performance in the first quarter and the outlook in our key regions, end markets, we are adjusting the full year company guidance, and we project company revenue -- consolidated company revenues to be down 2% to 5%, consistent with the prior year guidance despite the separation of Atmus. \n Company EBITDA margins are now projected to be approximately 14.5% to 15.5%, up 10 basis points from prior guidance, all of which excludes the net gain related to the separation of Atmus and the restructuring expenses. Our effective tax rate is expected to be 24%, excluding the tax-free gain related to Atmus and other discrete items. Capital investments will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, unchanged from our outlook 3 months ago as we continue to make critical investments in new products, capacity expansion to support future growth. \n In summary, we delivered solid sales, profitability and positive cash flow in the first quarter. We do still expect moderation in some of our key markets in the second half of 2024, but we have raised our expectations of our own performance relative to our prior guide. We took some steps to reduce costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continue to identify ways to streamline our business going forward leaving us well positioned to navigate any economic cyclicality and continue investing and delivering strong financial performance. \n Our priorities in 2024 for capital allocation are unchanged. We will reinvest for growth, plan to raise the dividend and reduce debt. Thank you for your interest today, and I look forward to seeing some of you in person in New York at our upcoming Analyst Day. \n Now let me turn it over to Chris. Yes. I think to be fair to everyone involved to all of you on that side of the fence and all of us here, there's a lot of moving parts with the separation of Atmus. So from my perspective, in total, we came in, in line with our expectations and when you adjust for the mid-quarter separation of Atmus, I think we're by and large in line. \n I would say, as someone pointed out, the Distribution business margins a little bit lower, certainly lower than last year. We see those at the bottom end of the range in Q1 and improving from here, largely driven by what we've seen as a pullback on parts sales, particularly in the industrial off-highway applications. \n So that's the 1 area. It's not new. It's been there for a couple of months, 2 quarters. But otherwise, I'd say we feel good about the gross margin improvement year-over-year. As you can see from our announcements and our comments, we're continuing to look at ways to streamline our organization, make us more efficient where we can. So overall, in line, Jerry, but expecting Distribution in particular to pick up in its margins going forward. \n We've always expected -- probably we were expecting this a little bit last year, to be fair, and it didn't materialize. But we are expecting heavy-duty truck production to decline in the third quarter, in particular, and you've probably heard that from other industry participants. I think the Engine business and Components will feel some of that in Q3, probably Q4 Power Systems and Distribution shouldn't see any significant volatility in revenues. \n And really, the momentum is to the up on Power Systems going forward and into next year, clearly. And Distribution. As you know, it's more than half parts and service and quite predictable and reliable. We just had a little bit of a mix shift with the lower parts, but we think that's temporary. We do tend to see some seasonality on revenue in the fourth quarter, a little bit in the second half. But I think the point of your question is essentially right, Nicole, there's positive momentum there. We've been raising the guidance as the performance is improving. \n There is some modest variation depending on how the parts flow in that business. But overall, our messages, we're confident in the business and the improvements that we have Jenny Bush and her team have really worked hard on over the last 18 months. And if we get more revenue, we're confident we'll be able to turn that in higher earnings. But there's nothing dramatically structurally different. Going forward, we expect improvement over time. Yes. I think you're exactly right, David. There's really 2 moving parts of the operating performance, which generally tends to move in line or better than the market rate. And then we get very lumpy tech fees from the joint venture back to Cummins consolidated results as new products are launched and last year was a particularly strong period of new product launch, [indiscernible] certain development milestones. So the tech fees are going to be down, particularly in the Engine business primarily and that's offsetting any assumptions around the market growth. \n I will say it's -- there was some truck OEM build increases in the Q1, but that was more on expectations or hopes about going forward, we're still waiting for clearer signs of momentum as China, as you know, is the biggest driver of the earnings there. But it's really lower tech fees, which were a big at last year -- a little bit in components, mostly in the Engine business. Which is embedded in Accelera. Good question. You're right that the Atmus separation is a little bit dilutive to margins. So yes, good that you picked up on that. It's really volume and a little bit of cost reduction activity. Those are the 2 primary drivers. So I heard you we will explicitly address incremental margins in May. You will not miss that for all who are asking, very appropriate, at center of mind -- or top of mind for us clearly. So you will hear that very, very shortly, I guess. Yes. And then what you heard maybe earlier was some industry consensus building about '25 and '26 ahead of 2027. So our baseline assumption today is that this is not as sharp or as steep as normal cyclical downturn. That's an assumption, not a fact, but that's what we've baked into our outlook for this year. China is the 1 where we're still -- we're waiting for more momentum probably."

            "name": "Jennifer Rumsey",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results, and then I will discuss our sales and end market trends by region. I will finish with a discussion of our outlook for 2024. Mark will then take you through more details of both our first quarter financial performance and our forecast for this year. Before getting into the details on our performance, I want to take a moment to highlight a few major events from the first quarter.\n In March, Cummins successfully completed the separation of our Filtration business, Atmus Filtration Technologies. Cummins will continue its focus on advancing innovative power solutions, while Atmus is now well positioned to pursue its own plans for profitable growth. We are proud of our employees' hard work and all who were involved to ensure successful separation, and we are excited to see what the future holds for both Cummins and Atmus. The final step in the separation of Atmus resulted in a tax-free exchange of shares, which reduced Cummins shares outstanding by 5.6 million.  \n In addition, we reintroduced our fuel-agnostic platforms with the name that captures the innovation that powers us forward, Cummins HELM platform. With higher efficiency, lower emissions and multiple fuels, the Cummins HELM platforms give our customers control of how they navigate their own journeys as part of the energy transition.  \n As the next product in the Cummins HELM 15-liter platform, we announced we will launch the next-generation diesel X15 in North America for the heavy duty on-highway market, which will be compliant with the U.S. EPA and CARB 2027 aligned regulations at launch. \n Lastly, in April, Cummins Power Generation introduced 4 new generator sets to the award-winning Centum Series, powered by Cummins QSK50 and QSK78 engines. These new models have been engineered specifically for the most critical applications such as data centers, health care facilities and wastewater treatment plant.  \n I was excited to attend the launch event with our customers and hear about the growing demand for these critical applications and high interest in our genset products, which build on decades of experience meeting our customers' needs and deliver a step change improvement in power density, assured reliability, sustainability and low emissions. Now I will comment on the overall company performance for the first quarter of 2024 and cover some of our key markets.  \n Demand for our products remained strong across many of our key markets and regions. Revenues for the first quarter were $8.4 billion, a decrease of 1% compared to the first quarter of 2023. EBITDA was $2.6 billion or 30.6% compared to $1.4 billion or 16.1% a year ago. \n First quarter 2024 results include a gain net of transaction costs and other expenses of $1.3 billion related to the Atmus divestiture and $29 million of restructuring expenses as we continue to work to simplify our operating structure and improve the efficiency of our business for the long term.  \n This compares to the first quarter 2023 results, which included $18 million of costs related to the separation of the Atmus business. Excluding the onetime gain and the costs related to the separation of Atmus as well as the restructuring expenses, EBITDA percentage decreased by 80 basis points as improved pricing partially offset lower volumes and higher research and development expenses as we continue to invest in the products and technologies that will create advantages in the future.  \n Gross margin dollars improved compared to the first quarter of 2023 as the benefits of pricing more than offset the impact of lower volumes and supply chain cost increases.\n Our first quarter revenues in North America were flat with 2023. Industry production of heavy-duty trucks in the first quarter was 73,000 units, down 5% from 2023 levels, while our heavy-duty unit sales were 26,000, down 7% from 2023. \n Industry production of medium-duty trucks was 41,000 units in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 8%, while our unit sales were 36,000, up 22% from 2023. We shipped 38,000 engines to Stellantis for use in the Ram pickups in the first quarter of 2024, down 2% from the 2023 levels. \n Revenues for North America power generation increased by 21%, driven by continued strong data center and mission-critical power demand. Our international revenues decreased by 1% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to a year ago. \n First quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5% as weaker domestic volumes were partially offset with the accelerating data center demand. Industry demand for medium- and heavy-duty trucks in China was 305,000 units, an increase of 14% from last year. However, shifts in the market share during the first quarter led to a decline in our volumes year-over-year. \n The light-duty market in China was up 2% from 2023 levels at 486,000 units, while our units sold, including joint ventures, were 37,000, an increase of 3%. Industry demand for excavators in the first quarter was 50,000 units, a decrease of 13% from 2023 levels. The decrease in the market size is due to weak property investment, high equipment population and slowing export demand. Our units sold were 9,000 units, an increase of 10% as a result of the QSM15 penetration and export growth. Sales of power generation equipment in China decreased 7% in the first quarter as accelerating data center demand was offset by softening in other markets.  \n First quarter revenues in India, including joint ventures, were $758 million, an increase of 1% from the first quarter a year ago. Industry truck production decreased by 7%, while our shipments decreased by 5% as the market slowed ahead of elections in April. Power generation revenues increased by 37% in the first quarter as economic activity remains strong. Now let me provide an outlook for 2024, including some comments on individual regions and end markets.  \n Our full year guidance now excludes Atmus from the March 18 separation date onwards and also include -- excludes the first quarter gain related to the divestiture. The guidance provided previously included Atmus for the full year as it preceded the transaction announcement. We are happy to share that our expectations for 2024 have improved from our initial guidance issued in February. Our forecast for total company revenue in 2024 remains the same at down 2% to 5%, which implies higher base business revenues of approximately $1.3 billion compared to our prior guidance as Atmus is now excluded from future quarters.  \n We are increasing our forecast for heavy-duty trucks in North America to 255,000 to 275,000 units in 2024 compared to our prior guide of 245,000 to 265,000 units, though We do still expect softening in the second half of the year. \n In North America, medium-duty truck market, we maintain our prior guidance of 140,000 to 150,000 units, down 5% to flat from 2023, consistent with our prior guidance, our engine shipments for pickup trucks in North America are expected to be 135,000 to 145,000 in 2024, down 5% to 10% from 2023 as we prepare to launch our model year 2025 in the fourth quarter. In China, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 3% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance.  \n We project a range of down 5% to up 10% in heavy- and medium-duty truck demand and expect a range of down 5% to up 5% in demand in the light-duty truck market. We expect replacement demand to be in the range -- to be the biggest driver, but the effect may be weakened by a sluggish economy and potentially slower export demand. \n The short-term shifts in the market share that I noted earlier are expected to normalize as we progress through the remainder of the year. In India, we project total revenue, including joint ventures, to increase 9% in 2024, primarily driven by strong power generation and on-highway demand, consistent with our prior guidance.  \n We expect industry demand for trucks to be flat to up 5% for the year. For global construction, we project down 10% to flat year-over-year, up from our previous guidance of down 5% to 15%. We continue to expect weak property investment and slowing export demand in China. We project our major global high-horsepower markets to remain strong in 2024.  \n We are raising our guidance for global power generation markets to be up 10% to 15% compared to our prior guidance of about 5% to 10%, driven by continued increases in the data center and mission-critical markets. \n Sales of mining engines are expected to be down 5% to up 5%, consistent with our prior guidance. While a smaller market for us, we continue to anticipate demand for oil and gas engines to decrease by 40% to 50% in 2024, primarily driven by decreased demand in North America.  \n For aftermarket, we've maintained our guidance of down 5% to up 5% for 2024, as we are through the inventory management efforts and destocking that happened throughout the industry in the second half of 2023. \n In Accelera, we expect full year sales to be $450 million to $500 million compared to $354 million in 2023, consistent with our prior guidance. We are ramping up electrolyzer manufacturing capacity and capability to deliver orders to our customers as well as expect continued growth in electrified components.  \n In summary, coming off a strong first quarter, we are maintaining our sales growth outlook for the year of down 2% to 5% as stronger demand in our base business has offset the removal of Atmus for future quarters from our guidance. We have also revised our forecast for EBITDA to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% compared to our previous guidance of 14.4% to 15.4%, reflecting stronger North America heavy-duty truck and power generation markets, which more than offsets the loss of profitability of Atmus.  \n In addition, we are taking steps to reduce cost, optimize our business and position Cummins for continued success in 2024. We are in a strong position to keep investing in the future, bringing new technologies to customers and returning cash to our investors. During the quarter, we returned $239 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, consistent with our long-term plan to return approximately 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders.  \n In addition, we reduced the overall Cummins share count by 5.6 million as we completed the Atmus share exchange, which will be more fully reflected in the average share count in the second quarter and beyond. \n I am impressed and grateful for the commitment of our employees and leaders around the world for delivering for our customers and generating strong financial performance at the same time. Our results further enhance Cummins' ability to keep investing in the future growth, bringing sustainable solutions that will protect our planet for future generations and returning cash to our shareholders.  \n I look forward to discussing our long-term strategy further in our upcoming Analyst Day on May 16 and now let me turn it over to Mark. Great. Thanks, Steve. And as you heard in the guidance, we're projecting the power gen business to be up 10% to 15% for the year, and data center, mission-critical is really the driver of that. And we've had a very strong demand from data center customers, have had historically a strong position in that market, and that market is obviously growing. We're sold out on our 95-liter through 2025 right now. And I mentioned the launch of the new Centum product, which uses our 50 and 78-liter engine. So that's providing additional solution to those customers. And then, of course, we're continuing to look at capacity of the 95-liter and how we plan to support what we think will be continuing strong and growing market. Yes, we do have concrete plans to increase the capacity that we have in place to-date for the 95-liter. Yes. I mean, as you noted, there's a requirement starting with the EPA 2027 regulations for longer emissions warranty for heavy-duty 10 years or 450,000 miles, most of that application is going to mile out. So it's essentially what our 5-year extended warranty that some customers are already purchasing. \n And then that will mean that everybody will need that warranty that will be embedded into pricing on those engine systems and then, of course, we'll drive customers to genuine part throughout that period, which will provide some further benefit to us. Yes. Well, obviously, I won't tell you what we're going to tell you specifically, but certainly, you can expect us to talk about overall strategy for the company where we think we're at against some of the 2030 goals that we shared in our last Analyst Day and certainly talking about revenue and margin expectations and what the drivers for that will be within that. So I think you'll hear more about that for sure, David, at our Analyst Day. Yes, we're expecting that. We have final regulatory approval for that battery JV. So we're expecting that's going to start flowing in Q2. Yes. So there's a couple of dynamics to keep in mind in that market. So first of all, as I articulated, the order board is pretty long. And so some of the work to improve price cost in response to inflation and performance of the business takes some time to play out. So we're starting to see stronger pricing leverage come into that market. And then we're continuing to, of course, drive improvements in the Power Systems business and efficiency in manufacturing and supply chain. And I noted the launch of the new products that we've also designed to be able to sell at some higher margins. So there are some favorable dynamics that have been happening in the power gen market compared to historically where we would have been in margin performance. Yes. So certainly, like in past emissions regulations, our goal is to deliver incremental value to the customer, to have margin improvement associated with that. You will see with the 27 EPA regulations, we already talked about the emissions warranty dynamic. You will also see added content, in particular, after-treatment system to meet those regulations has notable additional content. \n And then you will also have the warranty dynamic that we always have as we launch new products where we began at least to launch to accrue at a higher rate from a warranty perspective until the product is out in the market, and we've demonstrated warranty. So those are the moving parts that you'll see. We have not yet shared specific numbers on what we expect around exact pricing for those products. Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. And we are investing, as we've talked about in the new HELM engine platforms. And we're in a unique position because of our scale to continue to invest in what will be a market-leading engine solutions to meet those future regulations. \n And so we expect that, that will provide some advantage for us as we go into those regulations. There will be a dynamic we think that's going to play out in the '25 and '26 time period as end customers anticipate a major regulation change and what that will mean to them. \n And so we expect that's going to drive some things beyond the normal cycle in the U.S. truck market. And then as we go into 2017, there'll be some period of uptake, but we think we're well positioned. Obviously, our position in medium duty has continued to strengthen, and we'll have a next-generation 15-liter natural gas that will go into the market later this year that is of high interest to some of our customers that have sustainability ambitions and see this as the best way, most cost-effective and reliable way to meet those ambitions and then we'll have a new high-efficiency 15-liter platform and 10-liter platform as well. So we're excited about our position with those products and really focused on the execution of development and launching them into the market. Yes. So if you look beyond even the '27 into the EPA announced the Phase 3 greenhouse gas regulation, which is going to really start to shape the industry as we get into 2030 and beyond, no major surprises for us with that regulation, but it is really an unprecedented level of ambition and assumptions around 0 emissions vehicle penetration. And so the industry and the government is going to have to work really closely together for that to be successful.\n So to your question, one of the things -- there are a few things that we're pleased about in the regulation. One is it actually recognizes hydrogen engines as a zero-emission solution. So we believe that, that will create a space for hydrogen fueled engine that hydrogen fuel cells still are a good solution over time, but the adoption rate on that is likely to be -- take some time, I would say. And then the EPA also did commit to work to streamline hybrid powertrain certification. So hybrid engines, we think, may be an attractive solution because the infrastructure availability is going to be a challenge. \n So that's another thing that we're looking at closely. So there's still some engine-based solutions. Yes, we're seeing an uptick today in more of the battery electric powertrain as I noted, and of course, electrolyzers, fuel cells are still at pretty low level. Yes. I mean the partners have been working together ahead of getting the final regulatory approval we announced that we selected a site earlier this year. So we'll be -- we're getting a site ready in Mississippi, just outside of Memphis to kind of see and really starting the work to prepare for supply chain and building the plant. We -- now that we have regulatory approval, we believe we'll be able to close and finalize the entity in this quarter. \n And then we'll have phased investment as we build the plant and work towards start of production in 2027. And then we're, of course, sharing this investment of a 21-gigawatt hour plant across the partners and have this design that will allow us to phase in new lines and scale up the plant and production rates based on how we see the industry developing, and we're still feeling really good about how we're positioned in the market together with LFP cell that will be designed specifically for the commercial vehicle market and have the ability to leverage some of the incentive money that's available here to help enable adoption in our commercial vehicle market. Yes. And Jamie, good to have you back. We're, of course, working and you're seeing the improvement in the Meritor business as we do the integration and Accelera as we ramp up. Revenue, we'll talk more about that. In terms of color on the market, we're seeing continued solid demand in the heavy-duty market because of the high backlogs that have been built up, still a lot of strength in the vocational market. \n Truckload's been down for some time. And so we are still anticipating and hearing from our OEM customers that second half will have some weakening, and that's baked into our revised guidance, which is down, but not as far down as previous guidance. Power gen, I noted earlier, we've sold out the 95-liter through '25. We're looking at capacity there and how we can take that up as well as with the new Centum launch, being able to sell some of our other engines into that market as well. \n So pretty -- really strong feeling very good about power gen, feeling good about medium-duty and vocational on-highway. It's really the -- it's the truckload, fleet customers in the heavy-duty market. That's the one that we're watching closely and still anticipating that it's going to soften before we enter the next uptick in their cycle. I'm not sure that they're related. I mean, we're really watching what's going on with production rates with backlog with some of the spot rate dynamics in the market. And if you look at some of the freight carriers out there, they've been challenged now for the last 18 months. \n And so that's what's driving our outlook, but fair. I mean we -- because of the -- it's really the supply chain dynamic that has made this cycle so different and even unpredictable. It certainly held up better and longer than we had forecast, and we are still expecting to see some softening in the second half. Yes. So we are -- as you know, we've taken up our R&D investments. We noted that in our comments because we're making investments, in particular in these new fuel-agnostic engine platform. So we're at an elevated level of R&D for those new platform investments. And those products are beginning to launch and really will launch through the '26 and '27 time period. And then, of course, we're at a period of investment in the Accelera business as we work to launch new products and ramp up revenue there as well. Look forward to seeing many of you in person in a couple of weeks."
