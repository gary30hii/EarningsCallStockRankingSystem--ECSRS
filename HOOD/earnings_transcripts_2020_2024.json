[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Irvin Sha. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Sha: Thanks, Latif and welcome to everyone. And thank you for joining us for Robinhood's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are CEO and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev; and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements about Robinhood's outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2022, as well as our strategic and operational plans. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations. Other potential risk factors that could cause differences are described in our press release issued this afternoon, the related slide presentation on our Investor Relations website, our Form 10-Q filed October 29, 2021, and in our other SEC filings. We remind you that from time to time, we intend to use our blog Under the Hood on our website at blog.robinhood.com as a means of disclosing material information to the public. And investors should routinely monitor our blog as information posted there could be deemed to be material information. All information on the call is as of today, January 27, 2022, and we undertake no duty to update for subsequent events except as required by law. As we discuss our results, all percentage growth comparisons will be to the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the GAAP results to be consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investors.robinhood.com. With that. let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Irv as always. And thanks everyone for joining. I'd like to start by briefly reflecting on 2021, which has been a momentous year for us. We're really proud to have added over 10 million net funded accounts to Robinhood in 2021, with over half of them new to investing. We finished the year with $1.8 billion in total net revenues, up from $959 million in 2020. The story of the first half of 2021 was one of firming up our foundations and putting ourselves in a strong position to accelerate product development and future growth. During the year we've invested heavily in our platform leading to high service reliability and uptime. We've made huge strides in education and customer service, including successfully adding 24x7 live phone support. We completed our acquisition of Say Technologies, which as usual will be on display in this earnings call. We more than doubled our team, including in important areas like engineering, product, customer service, and compliance. And we're continuing to add senior talent to help us take Robinhood to the next level. I'm especially excited to welcome Steve Quirk who joined us this month as Chief Brokerage Officer and a member of our senior management team. I want to take a moment to thank our employees. The work we've done in 2021, firming up our foundations, while going through hyper growth involved law nights and weekends, and lots of personal sacrifice. We're starting to see the fruits of that work. In the third quarter, we started once again, accelerating our product engine. This acceleration has continued through Q4 and into the new year. We're now in a position where much of our resources are going toward new product development and innovating for our customers. Here are some of the meaningful things we've delivered for customers in Q4. We recently introduced first trade recommendations, which help new customers get started with a diversified ETF portfolio based on their risk profile and investment objectives. We've also introduced ACATS-In, which enables our customers to transfer assets from other into Robinhood. We launched this a few weeks ago to a small set of customers and have been gradually expanding its availability. With early results looking promising, we expect to complete the customer rollout later this quarter. In addition, we've made a number of enhancements to our options product, introducing options alerts, options watchlist, as well as a simple way to roll options contracts. We have made progress on our fully-paid securities lending program. While we continue to discuss it with our regulators, we believe we'll be able to launch the program during the first half of the year. We're also close to delivering a feature that our customers have been asking for, an even larger window of available trading hours. We call this feature hyper-extended hours and anticipate rolling it out later this quarter. And we added two new venues for executing equity trades, not only adding competition for customer orders, but improving our ability to handle surges at volume. We're also continuing to invest in crypto. We launched our public beta of crypto wallets earlier this month and plan to release the product to everyone later this quarter. Just in time for the holidays we introduced crypto gifting, which we believe is the most seamless way for customers to send crypto to their family and friends. We've rolled out intelligent crypto price alert, an often-requested feature. And similar to equities we added another venue for crypto increasing capacity and liquidity for our crypto volume, increasing price competition for orders. As Jason will touch on in a moment, along with this change, we've improved the revenue share we received from our venues. We continue to hear from customers that they want us to list more coins. We've been proactively engaging with regulators on this. They are expressing concerns about cryptocurrency platforms, adding coins that the regulators believe are unregistered securities and they are watching the space closely. That said we have robot us coin listing protocols in place. We're comfortable with how we've analyzed the coins currently on our platform, we have invested in the technology that will allow us to seamlessly add more coins, and we intend to add more coins going forward. Now, I'd like to talk about where we're going. I've talked a little bit already about how the foundation we built through most 2021 has allowed us to invest more in product development in Q4. While we're proud of what we delivered in Q4, it's nothing compared to what we have planned for 2022 and beyond. Our work is focused on three things. One, being the best place to get started investing; two, helping first time investors grow into long-term investors; and three, continuing to serve our advanced investors with the power and simplicity they need. Over the next several years, we plan to create an ecosystem of financial products and services that will enable people across the world to become investors. We believe the products on our roadmap will go a long way toward making that a reality. Here are a few things you can expect in 2022. First, long-term investing. We're working to roll out more offerings that make investing routine, give people more ways to build wealth for the future, bring them closer to the companies they invest in. And as we mentioned last quarter, tax-advantaged retirement accounts are on the roadmap and the teams are already hard at work to develop this functionality and we'll begin rolling it out to customers midyear. Second, spending and saving. In the coming months we will be introducing a new experience for day-to-day spending. With this new experience we believe we can serve customers who aspire to be investors, but aren't quite ready to set aside money to get started. We can help them build their portfolios, while serving their daily spending needs all with the delightful and innovative user experience they have come to expect from Robinhood. Next payments. You've already begun to see some initial progress here with crypto gifting. It's really our first peer-to-peer product. We want to build upon this and make it easy for customers to send value to others. We also want to make it easier for customers to deposit and withdraw funds. Today ACH is the primary way our customers move money, but it's slow. In 2021 customer deposits and withdrawals totaled $136 billion. We want to give customers faster ways to move their money. And in the next few months, we'll be introducing instant debit card deposit in withdrawals, and we'll look for additional rails from there. Finally, international. We believe serving customers across the globe is a big opportunity for us. And the investments we've made in crypto over the past year have put us in a great position to expand. In 2022, we've set aggressive goals to start opening our crypto platform up to customers internationally. This next phase of growth will not only be about adding new customers, but also deepening our relationship with the over 22 million customers we already have. We expect that our growth will continue to come in waves with periods of both outsized and slower growth, much of it linked to product launches, geographic expansion and, of course, market factors. We will remain focused on our customers and delivering innovative products that make it easier for everyone to become an investor. And with that, let me turn it over to Jason to discuss our financial results.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. 2021 was a strong year for our key metrics in revenues. Net funded accounts increased to $22.7 million, up 81% year-over-year. Monthly active users increased to 17.3 million, up 48% from December 2020 to December 2021. Assets under custody increased to $98 billion, up 56%. Total net revenues grew to $1.8 billion, up 89%. And adjusted EBITDA was $34 million. Additionally, we ended the year with over $6 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. We've never been in a stronger capital position as a company. Turning to Q4, we added 300,000 net funded accounts during the quarter. New funded accounts totaled 800,000; churned accounts totaled 700,000; and resurrected accounts totaled 200,000. For churn, we saw a 19% reduction compared to Q3, and on a percentage basis, churn hit its lowest mark in the last year and a half. Lastly, we had $4.4 billion in net deposits from customers for the quarter, up 93% sequentially but down 32% on a year-over-year basis. Now let's turn to revenue. Total net revenues were $363 million in Q4, up 14% year-over-year and in line sequentially. Our results for Q4 exceeded our previously communicated expectations as we saw stronger-than-anticipated trading activity. Transaction-based revenues were $264 million for the quarter, up 12% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Equities revenue was $52 million, down 35% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Options revenue was $163 million, up 14% year-over-year and roughly flat to Q3. And crypto revenue was $48 million, up 304% year-over-year but down 5% sequentially. As Vlad mentioned, in late December, we updated our pricing agreements with crypto market makers and added another venue to increase capacity and further improve competition for our customers. Our rebate, which is subject to change from time to time, more than doubled with these changes. As a reminder, this is the first time since launching our crypto business that we've updated the economic split between us and our venues. Looking at trading activities, there are a few call-outs. For equities trading, customers placing trades were up 21% year-over-year, which was offset by lower DARTs down 12% and lower notional volumes per trader down 43%. For options trading, customers placing trades were up 6% year-over-year, and options contracts per trader was up 20%, offset by lower DARTs, which were down 1%. And for crypto, customers placing trades were up 218% year-over-year. Crypto DARTs were up 176%, and notional volumes per trader increased 19%. Moving to assets under custody, equities was $72.1 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Options was $1.5 billion, which was down 28% as customers shifted their purchasing activity more towards short-dated positions. And crypto increased to $22.1 billion, up 528%. And for net revenues, they were $63 million for the quarter, up 1% year-over-year and in line sequentially. Primary components include securities lending, totaled $29 million was down 19% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. We\u2019ve been increasing the amount of securities loan to counterparties. However, market rate declines have more than offset these gains. As we look toward adding fully paid securities, we anticipate a significant opportunity to increase the monetization of this program. We believe fully paid securities lending at scale should be 1x to 2x times the size of margin securities lending, depending on opt-in rates by customers. Margin interest totaled $39 million in the quarter, up of 45% year-over-year. Our margin book closed out the year at $6.5 billion, a 93% increase versus the prior year. At the end of the quarter about 1% of our funded accounts maintained a margin balance. And interest expense was a $6 million offset to net interest revenues in Q4. As we anticipate fed rate increases during 2022, we expect that for every 25 basis points of rate increase, we\u2019ll generate approximately $40 million of additional annualized net interest revenue based on balances at year end 2021, while continuing to pass on value to customers. Moving to other revenues. They were $35 million in Q4 an 84% increase versus the prior year and in line with Q3. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by growth in our gold subscriptions and increased proxy delivery fees resulting from growth and assets under custody. As Vlad mentioned, we\u2019re working toward an enabling faster money movement for our customers. This represents a meaningful opportunity for us to earn service fees to the extent customers select this higher level of service. For context in 2021, customer withdrawals totaled $54 billion. Now for operating expenses. We finished the quarter with nearly 3,800 employees up 134% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. During the quarter we made sequential progress, reducing fraud losses down 28% versus Q3. We\u2019ve got more work to do here and this is constantly evolving. But I\u2019m proud of the progress our teams are making. Lastly, our teams are working diligently to improve our operating leverage and efficiency. One area I\u2019m particularly pleased with is web hosting, where the teams focused on efficiency and delivered a sequential improvement of 19% in Q4 versus Q3 for a savings of $15 million. Now let\u2019s turn to measures of profitability. Net loss for Q4 was $423 million, which includes $318 million in share base compensation. This compares to net income of $13 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $87 million compared with positive $79 million in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA primarily excludes the impact of share-based compensation. Before I get to our outlook, I\u2019d like to mention that we\u2019ve been carefully monitoring the behavior of our customers in this market environment. Since the start of the year, our customers have been continuing to deposit funds into their accounts on a net basis, but they\u2019ve been making fewer trades and in smaller amounts. In these first few weeks of the New Year, we\u2019re seeing trading activity below what we saw in Q4 of 2021. However, in the few days leading up to our call, we\u2019ve seen some higher levels of engagement, net deposits and trading versus the start of the year. It\u2019s too soon to say whether what we\u2019ve seen these last few days will be a sustained trend or not. And so for Q1, we\u2019re anticipating that total net revenues will be less than $340 million, which assumes some incremental improvement in trading volumes versus what we\u2019ve seen so far. At the top end, this implies a year-over-year revenue decline of 35%. As a reminder in Q1 last year, we had outsized revenue due to heightened trading activity, particularly relating to certain mean stocks. Now for full year 2022 operating expenses. We expect total operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation to increase between 15% and 20% year-over-year. Additionally, we expect share-based compensation to decline between 35% and 40% year-over-year. During 2022, we expect a meaningfully slow or hiring pace as we grow into the larger workforce we\u2019ve built over the past two years. While we exited 2021 with a higher run rate for employee compensation costs, we expect these costs to be partially offset as we begin realizing efficiencies across several areas of our business. We expect to realize improvements in such areas as customer service, cloud, web hosting and fraud losses as we focus on productivity and benefit from our increasing scale and investments we\u2019re making in technology. Actual results for total operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation may differ materially from our outlook due to several factors, including the rate of growth in net new funded accounts, which affect several costs, including variable marketing costs. The degree to which we are successful in preventing fraud, our ability to manage web hosting expenses efficiently and our ability to achieve productivity improvements in customer service among other factors. With that Irv, let\u2019s move to Q&A.\nA - Irvin Sha: Leading into this quarter\u2019s Q&A session, we\u2019ll start by answering the top questions from Say ranked by number of votes. We\u2019ll pass over any questions that were already addressed and we\u2019ll group together questions that share a common theme. After that we\u2019ll turn to live questions from the analyst community. And with that, I\u2019ll kick it off with our top questions from Say. First question comes from Ronak P, and Keith W, who asked when can we expect Robinhood to be profitable? What steps are being taken to make this happen?\nJason Warnick: Thanks for the question. Our primary measure internally for profitability is adjusted EBITDA. We actually, for the full year 2021 had a small positive adjusted EBITDA. When we look forward, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll have a positive adjusted EBITDA in 2022, but we\u2019ve got a much better line of sight for that in 2023. It\u2019s obviously going to depend on a few things, including overall market conditions and how well we execute against the new product roadmap. It\u2019s also going to be impacted by how effective we are at managing our costs, which we\u2019re definitely committed to do.\nIrvin Sha: Okay. Next we have a few questions on our recent share price activity from Olan B., Saajan P and Hamid N. Paraphrasing a bit. The question is Robinhood share price has dropped significantly since the IPO. What steps are being taken to increase shareholder value? Why should investors continue to believe in the company?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. Let\u2019s not sugarcoat it. We\u2019ve been disappointed with the stock price over the past few months. The way that we\u2019re thinking about it is as I wrote in my letter in the S1, we\u2019re never going to be sacrificing long-term performance or what\u2019s right for the company to make a quarter. We\u2019re focused on the long term. We have an exciting roadmap. We have a big opportunity and we\u2019ve grown a great team. We also have over 22 million customers. So we\u2019ll benefit from our scale as we roll out new products and new functionality for them. In addition, as Jason mentioned, we expect to grow our costs much more slowly from here on out. And you\u2019ve seen starting in Q3 and accelerating through Q4, we\u2019ve been able to allocate much more of our resources towards new product development on top of the foundation that we built throughout most of 2021 and 2020. So over 2022, you should see that to continue. We\u2019ve got a lot more products, a lot more improvements coming to customers, and I\u2019ve never been more optimistic about the future of Robinhood and how we can serve and innovate for our customers.\nIrvin Sha: Great. Next, we have some questions on adding new crypto coins to the platform from Zachary W and Israh B. The general question is, does Robinhood plan to open trading to other cryptocurrencies? And are we going to list Shiba Inu. Vlad?\nVlad Tenev: So we\u2019ve been hearing from customers loudly. We know they want more cryptocurrencies on the platform, and we\u2019ve actually been proactively engaging with regulators. So the main concern with adding a large number of coins is that platforms that are adding lots of them could be adding unregistered securities. So they\u2019re watching the space closely. We\u2019re being deliberate. We want to avoid triggering SEC registration requirements for cryptocurrencies. That said, we have robust protocols in place. We feel very confident about the coins that we have on the platform, and we intend to add more coins going forward that we want to do it prudently.\nIrvin Sha: Great. Next, we have another question from Saajan P, who asked, can Robinhood lay out a roadmap of features to come in 2022 on the Robinhood website.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you, Saajan. We\u2019ve been seeing your name a little bit. We appreciate the engagement with the company and the community. So I\u2019ve talked a little bit about a few of our key focus areas, including retirement, spending and saving, payments and of course, crypto and international expansion. So as you\u2019ve may have seen over the past few months, we have been building our crypto wallets in public. So we announced our intent to rollout wallets. We had an alpha. We\u2019ve collected great feedback from our community and customers to make the product better, and that\u2019s continued through beta. So while we won\u2019t be putting our full roadmap out in public, and we won\u2019t be building everything in public, we do see an opportunity to engage with our community even earlier than we normally would in the future, and announce some of the really ambitious things that that we\u2019re working on early in the cycle. We think it\u2019s a great way to get direct feedback from our customers and a great way to make sure the products really, really resonate with them. So we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019ve seen and you should expect a little bit more of that as we get further along into 2022.\nIrvin Sha: From Santosh I. Is Robinhood planning to extend after hours trading from 4 AM to 8:00 PM. Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks Santosh. Yes. I mentioned this a little bit earlier that we are close to actually rolling out what we\u2019re calling hyper extended hours for equities trading on the platform. Customers have been asking for it. We hear you. And we plan to roll it out later this quarter. So thank you for, for the feedback there.\nIrvin Sha: Our next question comes from Ben N. Is there anything Robinhood can do to repair the relationship with the retail traders upset about the handling of the meme stocks situation that occurred last year to bring these traders back to the platform?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. Thank you, Ben. This is something that I've spent a lot of time thinking about and the Robinhood team has been thinking about a lot. So first let me say that, the events of the meme-stock frenzy January of last year were hard, they were hard on Robinhood. They were hard on our customers. We stand for giving people access to markets and letting them trade what they want to trade. And it was disappointing to customers. We realized that, and we've done a lot of investments to make sure that what happened then doesn't happen again. So we've raised a lot of capital, we've upgraded our infrastructure to handle surges and volume. We've added things like 24/7 support. So the best way is to just make sure that we communicate these things and take all the steps necessary to avoid similar restrictions surprising customers. Now, looking forward to customers that have been disappointed, we've actually seen over the last year a greater number of customers that had left the platform that are interested in coming back and re-engaging. And one of the things that we noticed was, that it wasn't as easy as it should have been for customers to come back to the platform. And that's something that we've been in investing in. You see that with ACATS in. So prior to us rolling that out, there was no way for customers to bring outside assets into Robinhood. And we've also looked at the user experience of a returning customer and are making lots of improvements in how easy it is to reopen your account and start using Robinhood again. And we're starting to see results. So the results are looking promising and that's an area that we'll continue to make progress in.\nIrvin Sha: Okay. Donte F is asking, when are wallets and staking coming to Robinhood?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, I can feel this one again. So we launched the public beta of our crypto wallets earlier this month, and we've been continuing to make refinements to those. And we're looking to release those later this quarter to everyone. As for staking, so we know staking is an area of customer interest, and we've actually been investing a lot in the crypto team and the technology to enable things like this. I should say there's lots of regulatory attention here. We need to make sure that staking products are safe and clear to customers. And of course are compliant. And I would say we're looking at the area and we're going to be investing heavily in crypto in general as we've discussed.\nIrvin Sha: Great. So the next question is coming from Peter D who asks, what was the cause of the price drop and what are you doing to rectify it? Maybe Jason?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, thanks for the question, Peter. It's a number of factors and some of it is certainly on us at Robinhood and some of it is the general market. Clearly the fed signaling, increasing rates along with inflation. We've seen a rotation away from growth stocks, like Robinhood it's affected the industry, but it's absolutely affected our shares as well. But there's also things that we need to be doing and it's questions around our strategy, our speed of execution and also I think providing just additional clarity about what we're working on and when you should expect progress from us. And we've been trying very hard in this call and in the materials that we're sharing today to give you a really good insight into the roadmap and also the expected timing and impact of our roadmap. So we're working on it. We're going to stay as Vlad mentioned, focused on the long term, but we're definitely very optimistic about where we can go from here.\nIrvin Sha: Thanks for that. G C. and Donald D are both asking about NFTs. Their questions were, does Robinhood have any plans on to extend its crypto offerings to include a non-fungible token marketplace?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, we've been watching this space carefully as well. We know there's a lot of customer interest in this area and we've grown our crypto team and are investing heavily in crypto. I mentioned some of the really ambitious things that we've got planned for 2022, including using crypto to expand internationally, obviously making more progress on wallets, rolling them out and continuing to improve them. And I think you should expect to see that and more so, I don't want to get too specific on any of the other new products you have in crypto, but we're very excited to keep investing in the space and we think it's still early innings.\nIrvin Sha: Next question is going to be from Gennadii K, hope I'm pronouncing that right. When will Robinhood be available in Europe?\nVlad Tenev: So, as we mentioned earlier on the call, we've set aggressive targets to start opening our crypto platform internationally this year. So we aren't able to say exactly when or which countries, but I would tell you, international is especially interesting for crypto, which is built to be global by default. And being a global company is core to our vision. We look forward to updating you as soon as possible and making Robinhood available all over the world. We think there's a huge opportunity there.\nIrvin Sha: Great. I think this will be the last question that we have time for, this one comes from Alexander X, who's asking, will Robinhood add more advanced features into the app, such as allowing people to specify a mailing address or a tax centre to preview realized gains and losses? The app is sometimes too bare.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. In terms of advanced features look, one of the best ways to prioritize features is by hearing directly from our customers. And as I mentioned, one of our three areas is making sure that our advanced investors have all the tools and support they need. And I think there's a lot of opportunity here. Steve Quirk, who joined recently as our Chief Brokerage Officer, is looking very closely at this area and brings a wealth of experience serving advanced investors at places like Thinkorswim and TD Ameritrade.\nIrvin Sha: Great. I think that's all the time we have for Say questions right now. Thanks everyone for those questions. With that, I'm going to ask the operator to please open up the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your line is open.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, Vlad, hey Jason. So a question on the gross adds. So your new funded accounts were running around 600,000 per quarter pre-pandemic. We're now at around 800,000. Is this the right level to think about? And Vlad, all those initiatives you mentioned in 2022, which new products could potentially unlock a faster cadence of gross adds? And then second question just on international, housekeeping. Can you remind us outside of the U.K., which markets are you fully licensed to operate the full stack brokerage business today versus just dealing with the crypto? Thank you.\nJason Warnick: I'll start, and then I think Vlad will probably jump in. Thanks, Ross, for the questions. In terms of the expectation for future adds, what I would say is we think that there's a significant opportunity ahead of us, starting first with the U.S. and investing to have more customers join the platform. We've done some internal research. It suggests that of the demographic of 18- to 49-year-olds, a little over half have a brokerage account. And in our research, it suggests that currently, there's about 10 million or more that are currently don't have an account and are interested in participating in the stock market. There's a long-term trend of increasing retail participation, and we think that's a great place to be able to leverage and participate. We also have opportunity, I think, as Vlad mentioned, with the road map to generate interest in new customers with the other products and also international is an even bigger opportunity, we believe, over the long-term. Vlad, I'll turn it to you for kind of areas we're most excited about.\nVlad Tenev: Yes, absolutely. I think of the areas that we talked a little bit about, if you're looking at net new funded accounts, international certainly is a big opportunity with more addressable new accounts over the long run than even in the U.S. With our work on spending and saving and payments, we also believe that we can access a broader type of investor, people that are not quite ready to invest, but could use Robinhood to help manage their day-to-day spending needs, and then we could help them become investors over time. And we think that's an exciting market. And then there's always just the work in making our core experience better, making our core investing products better, making the flows and the user experience even stronger and getting customers to consequently refer their friends to Robinhood in greater numbers. So that's net new funded accounts. And as we've also mentioned, there's opportunities to increase ARPU and to monetize our accounts by giving them more functionality over time. And those include things like retirement and some of the other areas of focus through the year as well.\nJason Warnick: His last question was brokerage licenses.\nVlad Tenev: Brokerage licenses overseas, yes. So we have a license by the FCA to operate brokerage business in the U.K., and that's right now the only international jurisdiction that we have a brokerage license for.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I\u2019ve got two, I think for Jason. One, the press release and you highlighted $6.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. How much do you want to hold to run the business as it exists today? And how much of that cash is truly excess above regulatory operational needs, including what you might need to post at a clearing house during peak trading periods?\nJason Warnick: Yes. Thanks, Ken. Great question. On a typical day, the vast majority of that is not needed to support our business. Since last year around the surges that we saw, obviously, we raised cash, but we also opened up increasing lines of credit as well. And so to support the trading, it's not just the corporate cash that we have, but also lines of credit. Additionally, we substantially increased the capital at the clearing broker, and the level of capitalization actually affects the calculation of how much deposits you have to put on \u2013 put for the clearinghouse. In fact, right now, we're over 20x above the required capital for our clearing brokers. So we're looking very solid. As I said, the vast majority of our corporate cash is not needed on a daily basis. And there's things that we can do from a process perspective, particularly around funding buying activity and selling activity over weekends for crypto that will further alleviate the need for the cash. So we're sitting in a really good spot. We've got more that we can do, and we feel great that we're in a position to make sure we can handle customer trades no matter the environment.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. And then I just was hoping you could flesh out your comments on the $40 million, I believe, of net interest revenue that comes with higher rates per 25 bps. What part of that incremental revenue is anticipated from stock loan versus the impact of higher rates and margin borrowing versus, say, the float on customer cash balances? Does that $40 million come from the majority of one or the other? Or is it sort of equal across all three? How are you sort of allocating or how should we allocate that $40 million across the different interest rate-generating buckets?\nJason Warnick: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ken. The biggest components are around \u2013 obviously, corporate cash, we just talked about having over $6 billion there. That will certainly be affected by a rising interest rate environment. Free credit balances from customers those balances fluctuate, but it's many billion \u2013 over $6 billion of customer margin balances as well. There's also anticipated that will be some earnings from rising interest rate on the collateral that we receive on the securities lending program, which is also a few billions. So those are the biggest components.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJason Warnick: Yes. You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your question, please.\nDevin Ryan: Hey, great. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess first question here on the product road map. So the stock is down a little bit over 10% in the afterhours here. Some of the feedback I've gotten initially is just you had a first quarter outlook and little disappointment. But you guys gave a pretty ambitious road map here, and a lot of the products that you talked about aren't actually going to be in the first quarter but are coming later this year. So there should be a pretty good acceleration. So I don't know if we can maybe parse through maybe some of the ARPU implications and maybe just to not get too cute here, but Jason, I heard the comment about adjusted EBITDA this year, not ruling out that it could be positive. And so that would imply that you'd actually see potentially some decent revenue growth on the year. So first quarter, notwithstanding, which I think may be a little disappointing to people, it seems like there's a lot of things here that should drive revenues higher. So I just want to maybe walk through some of those if possible.\nJason Warnick: Yes. Devin, thanks for the question. What I would say is we provided some indication on when to expect some of these products to roll out, and then there's going to be ramp-up time for customer adoption as well. And so it's going to be back half of the year loaded and into 2023. And also, certainly, our revenue for the year is going to depend on the overall market environment for trading. But we're particularly excited about the fully paid stock lending program, which we're expecting to be able to roll out kind of mid-year that can have a meaningful impact, one to 2x the size of our margin securities business. We're kind of thinking internally that it's going to take several months for that to ramp. So just to give you a sense on that. Excited also about offering customers the ability to move their money faster. And we haven't talked about the monetization yet for \u2013 particularly for withdrawals, but we do anticipate to see some uplift in revenue to the extent customers choose to move their money faster. But definitely for new products, I would say it's back of the year weighted and getting more momentum in 2023.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, great. Just a quick follow-up here on some of the international conversations. So if we think about the crypto market outside the U.S., is there an opportunity to maybe roll out more features and functionality. My sense is from Vlad's comments that the regulatory regime in the U.S. is just a little bit more cautious. And so you want to make sure that you're abiding by that. But outside the U.S., there may be some looser standards in different areas, different jurisdictions. So I'm curious if the international offering will look different outside the U.S. where maybe you can add additional features and then you flip those into the U.S. to the extent we have more visibility on U.S. policy?\nVlad Tenev: Yes, I'd be happy to field that one. Certainly, the environment and regulatory regimes are different depending on where you're offering your products. We have a particular environment in the U.S., and we have a large U.S. business with crypto and the core brokerage. So regulatory compliance is at the center of everything that we do. We have to make sure that we operate prudently and work with our regulators. And overseas in some jurisdictions, the environment might be different. So yes, there will be opportunities to add products internationally that won't necessarily be available in the U.S. And I think vice versa is also the case.\nDevin Ryan: Yes. Okay. Terrific.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to see if you could provide an update on your fully paid securities lending launch for the first half. And I want to see what do you think the economic impact will be to your clients and your business? And I also see that you're in regulatory discussions. So what does the regulatory process look like for this initiative?\nJason Warnick: Yes. So it's \u2013 we have to work closely with FINRA to make sure that they understand the program and the terms and all the operational details of the program. We're meeting with them proactively and making sure that we're \u2013 have a common understanding of how the product will be introduced. We aren't at the point to share the economic split with customers, but we do see this as an opportunity for customers to get enhanced yield on their portfolios. In terms of like the impact to the company, it's going to depend on the adoption rate. It is an attractive opportunity for customers. So there's a good opportunity, I think, for us to see a nice customer uptake on the program. And we think it could be one to 2x the size of our margin securities lending business at scale.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. And then just as my follow-up, and I'm sorry if I missed it, but what are your plans to roll out IRAs and other retirement products at this point?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. So this is a key area of focus for 2022. As I mentioned on the call earlier, taking our first-time investors and helping them become long-term investors is a big thread that we've been pulling on. You've seen that with recurring investments. ACATS-In also helps with that. And retirement and long-term automated investing is another area we're very closely looking at. So we expect to roll out in 2022. And we've heard lots of customer demand for this. They want multiple account types, including IRAs and Roths. And I think that, coupled with ACATS-In and the work that we've done in recurring this creates a meaningful opportunity to increase account balances.\nJason Warnick: Yes, and Craig, we're signaling for the retirement accounts that we'll start rolling that out in midyear.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Nance of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nWill Nance: Hey guys. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on some of the commentary you made in the prepared remarks around the changes to the market maker list on crypto. I mean you mentioned a pretty big increase in the rebate levels. I think you said it more than doubled, and it sounded like that happened kind of towards the end of the quarter. And just \u2013 am I missing something there that if the rebate levels are doubled, is that a sustainable increase in rebate levels? And I guess an important caveat of all else equal, should we not see the same increase in revenues as we go into the first quarter? Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Yes. Thanks, Will, for the question. So the rebate did more than double. It was effective really at the beginning of this year. And all else being equal, you'd expect the revenue to fall in line. We have seen, as I mentioned at the beginning of the year, slower trading levels but for the last several days leading into the call, and that's what we use to inform the guidance that we gave. And in terms of whether it's \u2013 yes. Sorry, you asked Will, about the sustainability of it. We do expect from time to time that these will be negotiated. But I think that we feel really good about the level that we're at now.\nWill Nance: Got it. That's helpful. Appreciate it. And then just do like a general more of a high level question on crypto, maybe for Vlad. It strikes me that a bit of an unlevel playing field and the crypto markets right now. It sounds like some of your fed regulator brokers are basically insinuated the regulators. Don't want them rolling out anything in the crypto space. You guys seem to be completely restricted on adding new coins. And then the crypto exchanges, some are even more tightly regulated ones like Coinbase kind of continue to add new coins to their platform. The SEC seems to have a lot on their plate right now in terms of new regulatory guidance. So I guess the question is, is there any line of to these issues actually resolving and what is your confidence level that you'll actually be able to roll out new cryptocurrencies on the platform in 2022?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. I wouldn't say that we've been prevented from adding any coins. I think what I'd say is that we've been proactively engaging with the regulators. They're concerned that a lot of these platforms that are adding a lot of coins may be adding unregistered securities and there's been a lot of scrutiny in the space as you've seen. So we're definitely being deliberate. We want to avoid triggering SEC registration requirements. Getting it wrong could harm users. So we are happy with the protocols we have in place, and we do intend to add more coins going forward, but we want to make sure we do it prudently.\nWill Nance: Got it. Thanks for taking my question.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks Will.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Good evening. So first I want to congratulate you on the hiring of Steve Quirk. He's definitely experienced and talented brokerage executive. Next you, I guess the question is Jason and I can see you have done out of your way to try to give us insight into sort of the contribution of some of these new initiatives. And I guess another cut at it would be, if we were looking a year from now and doing this call next year, which do you think \u2013 which products so we can get a feel for your belief in the prospect \u2013 which products do you think will have the biggest revenue contribution. And you did talk about margin lending being 1 to 2x, the fully paid lending being 1 to 2x, like what type of a ramp up period do you need for that to you get to that 1 to 2x?\nJason Warnick: Yes. We're kind of assuming it's going to take up to about five months to get the program ramped. It's hard to know exactly how long it'll take that may prove to be conservative. And we may prove to not be conservative enough by a few months, but that's kind of the, the general way we're thinking about the timing for that. And look, I think there's \u2013 I think there's a lot of interesting opportunities that can contribute to revenue in the areas that we're talking about. Certainly international crypto could be one of those areas we talked about fully paid securities lending. Our spending product, obviously depending on adoption could be also a meaningful way to not just earn revenue, but attract new customers. So I really think that this is an opportunity that has many components. And we're really excited about that one. One other thing that we actually didn't talk about in the call, you've probably heard me in the past talk about Robinhood Gold and the subscription opportunity. We've assembled a team and we're building a plan and are excited relatively soon to start adding value into our Robinhood Gold subscription. And I think that that in particular, if we do that right can add a lot of positive synergy to the platform and the customer experience.\nRich Repetto: Got it. And I have one follow-up on the cash question. A lot has been written about the meme stock volatility; Vlad you talked about how unique of an event it was last year. So, and then Jason you've went through all the efficiencies you're doing with the capital as well. So I guess the question is, do you really need this same level of capital? And what would you do? Are you going to just maintain it and have it sit in the balance sheet? Or what will you do if you \u2013 we don't see that same level of pretty unique activity from the first quarter, excuse me, of last year?\nJason Warnick: Yes, Rich, we're in, as I said a much better position including capitalizing the broker dealer 20x or more off the regulatory required amounts. We also run as you would expect stress scenarios, and those include events that look like what we saw a year ago. And so we need to make sure that we're comfortable that no matter what the trading environment is that we can support our customers. Now, there's more efficient ways to accomplish that than just parking a bunch of cash on your balance sheet. And like I said, we've made some progress with our lines of credit. And there's some operation things that we can do to help fund the crypto business more efficiently, particularly over weekends. Over time I'd like to see us having a working capital structure \u2013 a capital structure that is more balanced between debt and equity. So that's something that we'll think about over time. But we're also a growth company and we've got big ambitions. And so I think it makes sense that we have enough dry powder to be able to pursue those growth opportunities. And so that's kind of how we're thinking about it \u2013 it's evolving and as we get better with our procedures and get access to more lines of credit, it'll give us even more flexibility.\nRich Repetto: Great. Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. Your next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good afternoon. So wanted to start off with a question on the expense management strategy or philosophy you guided to a meaningful step up in expense as part of an ambitious investment agenda in the coming year. Now, I was hoping you could walk through how we should be thinking about the payback period for those investments you're making and how you're building some expense flexibility into the model, if the revenue environment remains more challenging?\nJason Warnick: Yes. Thanks, Steve. So the guidance is a meaningful slowdown versus how we've been growing these last couple of years our cost basis. It is assuming a deceleration of hiring, which is owing to the fact that we've more than doubled each of the last couple of years and really find ourselves in a great position across the board, whether it's engineering and product, which are important for doing new things and compliance and customer service with 24/7. And so really across the board, we feel really good about the team that we've assembled so much so that we can grow at a much, much slower rate, and then looking across \u2013 across the business there's this opportunity for us to be more efficient and use technology to deliver greater productivity. And so I mentioned briefly just the progress we're making on web hosting. It's a meaningful expense line item for us, down sequentially about $15 million and there's more opportunity there. And we have line of sight on that even in Q1 and through the rest of the year. Greater opportunity to be even more efficient serving our customers through customer support, a big piece of that is just kind of relentlessly identifying reasons why customers have to contact us in the first place and solve those issues at the root. Give customers an ability to self-serve, making it to where that we can \u2013 we can take the team that we have and focus on the really higher level challenges and questions that our customers have so that the paper cuts if you will that are on the platform today just get resolved or handled directly by customers, which is a much better path for them and to get a quick resolution. So it's really those kinds of efforts that we're made that's going to drive kind of leverage in the business. In terms of kind of the payback time and how we're thinking about investments, we're able to for the most part in our engineering team focus incremental investments on kind of the new things. We as I said made just a lot of progress on staffing the teams and so we feel really, really good about incremental investments contributing to the business.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that caller, Jason. Just a quick follow-up, just on the operating backdrop given the recent sell off and growth equities and crypto where retail in general but certainly your clients are more heavily invested. You spoke of declining activity levels to start the year. I was hoping you could provide some perspective on what you're seeing in terms of margin utilization and whether you've experienced any losses on margin accounts?\nJason Warnick: Yes. So definitely when stock prices decline there'll be some level of margin calls and margin maintenance from customers. Given the collateral that we that \u2013 we have in our program and the timeliness of those kinds of margin calls we're not experiencing any meaningful losses on that at all.\nOperator: At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Irvin Sha for closing remarks, sir.\nIrvin Sha: Great. We appreciate the time everyone. Thank you. And we will be talking to you again next quarter.\nJason Warnick: Thank you. Appreciate the questions.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thanks, Irv as always. And thanks everyone for joining. I'd like to start by briefly reflecting on 2021, which has been a momentous year for us. We're really proud to have added over 10 million net funded accounts to Robinhood in 2021, with over half of them new to investing. We finished the year with $1.8 billion in total net revenues, up from $959 million in 2020. The story of the first half of 2021 was one of firming up our foundations and putting ourselves in a strong position to accelerate product development and future growth. During the year we've invested heavily in our platform leading to high service reliability and uptime. We've made huge strides in education and customer service, including successfully adding 24x7 live phone support. We completed our acquisition of Say Technologies, which as usual will be on display in this earnings call. We more than doubled our team, including in important areas like engineering, product, customer service, and compliance. And we're continuing to add senior talent to help us take Robinhood to the next level. I'm especially excited to welcome Steve Quirk who joined us this month as Chief Brokerage Officer and a member of our senior management team. I want to take a moment to thank our employees. The work we've done in 2021, firming up our foundations, while going through hyper growth involved law nights and weekends, and lots of personal sacrifice. We're starting to see the fruits of that work. In the third quarter, we started once again, accelerating our product engine. This acceleration has continued through Q4 and into the new year. We're now in a position where much of our resources are going toward new product development and innovating for our customers. Here are some of the meaningful things we've delivered for customers in Q4. We recently introduced first trade recommendations, which help new customers get started with a diversified ETF portfolio based on their risk profile and investment objectives. We've also introduced ACATS-In, which enables our customers to transfer assets from other into Robinhood. We launched this a few weeks ago to a small set of customers and have been gradually expanding its availability. With early results looking promising, we expect to complete the customer rollout later this quarter. In addition, we've made a number of enhancements to our options product, introducing options alerts, options watchlist, as well as a simple way to roll options contracts. We have made progress on our fully-paid securities lending program. While we continue to discuss it with our regulators, we believe we'll be able to launch the program during the first half of the year. We're also close to delivering a feature that our customers have been asking for, an even larger window of available trading hours. We call this feature hyper-extended hours and anticipate rolling it out later this quarter. And we added two new venues for executing equity trades, not only adding competition for customer orders, but improving our ability to handle surges at volume. We're also continuing to invest in crypto. We launched our public beta of crypto wallets earlier this month and plan to release the product to everyone later this quarter. Just in time for the holidays we introduced crypto gifting, which we believe is the most seamless way for customers to send crypto to their family and friends. We've rolled out intelligent crypto price alert, an often-requested feature. And similar to equities we added another venue for crypto increasing capacity and liquidity for our crypto volume, increasing price competition for orders. As Jason will touch on in a moment, along with this change, we've improved the revenue share we received from our venues. We continue to hear from customers that they want us to list more coins. We've been proactively engaging with regulators on this. They are expressing concerns about cryptocurrency platforms, adding coins that the regulators believe are unregistered securities and they are watching the space closely. That said we have robot us coin listing protocols in place. We're comfortable with how we've analyzed the coins currently on our platform, we have invested in the technology that will allow us to seamlessly add more coins, and we intend to add more coins going forward. Now, I'd like to talk about where we're going. I've talked a little bit already about how the foundation we built through most 2021 has allowed us to invest more in product development in Q4. While we're proud of what we delivered in Q4, it's nothing compared to what we have planned for 2022 and beyond. Our work is focused on three things. One, being the best place to get started investing; two, helping first time investors grow into long-term investors; and three, continuing to serve our advanced investors with the power and simplicity they need. Over the next several years, we plan to create an ecosystem of financial products and services that will enable people across the world to become investors. We believe the products on our roadmap will go a long way toward making that a reality. Here are a few things you can expect in 2022. First, long-term investing. We're working to roll out more offerings that make investing routine, give people more ways to build wealth for the future, bring them closer to the companies they invest in. And as we mentioned last quarter, tax-advantaged retirement accounts are on the roadmap and the teams are already hard at work to develop this functionality and we'll begin rolling it out to customers midyear. Second, spending and saving. In the coming months we will be introducing a new experience for day-to-day spending. With this new experience we believe we can serve customers who aspire to be investors, but aren't quite ready to set aside money to get started. We can help them build their portfolios, while serving their daily spending needs all with the delightful and innovative user experience they have come to expect from Robinhood. Next payments. You've already begun to see some initial progress here with crypto gifting. It's really our first peer-to-peer product. We want to build upon this and make it easy for customers to send value to others. We also want to make it easier for customers to deposit and withdraw funds. Today ACH is the primary way our customers move money, but it's slow. In 2021 customer deposits and withdrawals totaled $136 billion. We want to give customers faster ways to move their money. And in the next few months, we'll be introducing instant debit card deposit in withdrawals, and we'll look for additional rails from there. Finally, international. We believe serving customers across the globe is a big opportunity for us. And the investments we've made in crypto over the past year have put us in a great position to expand. In 2022, we've set aggressive goals to start opening our crypto platform up to customers internationally. This next phase of growth will not only be about adding new customers, but also deepening our relationship with the over 22 million customers we already have. We expect that our growth will continue to come in waves with periods of both outsized and slower growth, much of it linked to product launches, geographic expansion and, of course, market factors. We will remain focused on our customers and delivering innovative products that make it easier for everyone to become an investor. And with that, let me turn it over to Jason to discuss our financial results. Yes. Let's not sugarcoat it. We've been disappointed with the stock price over the past few months. The way that we're thinking about it is as I wrote in my letter in the S1, we're never going to be sacrificing long-term performance or what's right for the company to make a quarter. We're focused on the long term. We have an exciting roadmap. We have a big opportunity and we've grown a great team. We also have over 22 million customers. So we'll benefit from our scale as we roll out new products and new functionality for them. In addition, as Jason mentioned, we expect to grow our costs much more slowly from here on out. And you've seen starting in Q3 and accelerating through Q4, we've been able to allocate much more of our resources towards new product development on top of the foundation that we built throughout most of 2021 and 2020. So over 2022, you should see that to continue. We've got a lot more products, a lot more improvements coming to customers, and I've never been more optimistic about the future of Robinhood and how we can serve and innovate for our customers. So we've been hearing from customers loudly. We know they want more cryptocurrencies on the platform, and we've actually been proactively engaging with regulators. So the main concern with adding a large number of coins is that platforms that are adding lots of them could be adding unregistered securities. So they're watching the space closely. We're being deliberate. We want to avoid triggering SEC registration requirements for cryptocurrencies. That said, we have robust protocols in place. We feel very confident about the coins that we have on the platform, and we intend to add more coins going forward that we want to do it prudently. Thank you, Saajan. We've been seeing your name a little bit. We appreciate the engagement with the company and the community. So I've talked a little bit about a few of our key focus areas, including retirement, spending and saving, payments and of course, crypto and international expansion. So as you've may have seen over the past few months, we have been building our crypto wallets in public. So we announced our intent to rollout wallets. We had an alpha. We've collected great feedback from our community and customers to make the product better, and that's continued through beta. So while we won't be putting our full roadmap out in public, and we won't be building everything in public, we do see an opportunity to engage with our community even earlier than we normally would in the future, and announce some of the really ambitious things that that we're working on early in the cycle. We think it's a great way to get direct feedback from our customers and a great way to make sure the products really, really resonate with them. So we're happy with what we've seen and you should expect a little bit more of that as we get further along into 2022. Thanks Santosh. Yes. I mentioned this a little bit earlier that we are close to actually rolling out what we're calling hyper extended hours for equities trading on the platform. Customers have been asking for it. We hear you. And we plan to roll it out later this quarter. So thank you for, for the feedback there. Yes. Thank you, Ben. This is something that I've spent a lot of time thinking about and the Robinhood team has been thinking about a lot. So first let me say that, the events of the meme-stock frenzy January of last year were hard, they were hard on Robinhood. They were hard on our customers. We stand for giving people access to markets and letting them trade what they want to trade. And it was disappointing to customers. We realized that, and we've done a lot of investments to make sure that what happened then doesn't happen again. So we've raised a lot of capital, we've upgraded our infrastructure to handle surges and volume. We've added things like 24/7 support. So the best way is to just make sure that we communicate these things and take all the steps necessary to avoid similar restrictions surprising customers. Now, looking forward to customers that have been disappointed, we've actually seen over the last year a greater number of customers that had left the platform that are interested in coming back and re-engaging. And one of the things that we noticed was, that it wasn't as easy as it should have been for customers to come back to the platform. And that's something that we've been in investing in. You see that with ACATS in. So prior to us rolling that out, there was no way for customers to bring outside assets into Robinhood. And we've also looked at the user experience of a returning customer and are making lots of improvements in how easy it is to reopen your account and start using Robinhood again. And we're starting to see results. So the results are looking promising and that's an area that we'll continue to make progress in. Yeah, I can feel this one again. So we launched the public beta of our crypto wallets earlier this month, and we've been continuing to make refinements to those. And we're looking to release those later this quarter to everyone. As for staking, so we know staking is an area of customer interest, and we've actually been investing a lot in the crypto team and the technology to enable things like this. I should say there's lots of regulatory attention here. We need to make sure that staking products are safe and clear to customers. And of course are compliant. And I would say we're looking at the area and we're going to be investing heavily in crypto in general as we've discussed. Yeah, we've been watching this space carefully as well. We know there's a lot of customer interest in this area and we've grown our crypto team and are investing heavily in crypto. I mentioned some of the really ambitious things that we've got planned for 2022, including using crypto to expand internationally, obviously making more progress on wallets, rolling them out and continuing to improve them. And I think you should expect to see that and more so, I don't want to get too specific on any of the other new products you have in crypto, but we're very excited to keep investing in the space and we think it's still early innings. So, as we mentioned earlier on the call, we've set aggressive targets to start opening our crypto platform internationally this year. So we aren't able to say exactly when or which countries, but I would tell you, international is especially interesting for crypto, which is built to be global by default. And being a global company is core to our vision. We look forward to updating you as soon as possible and making Robinhood available all over the world. We think there's a huge opportunity there. Yeah. In terms of advanced features look, one of the best ways to prioritize features is by hearing directly from our customers. And as I mentioned, one of our three areas is making sure that our advanced investors have all the tools and support they need. And I think there's a lot of opportunity here. Steve Quirk, who joined recently as our Chief Brokerage Officer, is looking very closely at this area and brings a wealth of experience serving advanced investors at places like Thinkorswim and TD Ameritrade. Yes, absolutely. I think of the areas that we talked a little bit about, if you're looking at net new funded accounts, international certainly is a big opportunity with more addressable new accounts over the long run than even in the U.S. With our work on spending and saving and payments, we also believe that we can access a broader type of investor, people that are not quite ready to invest, but could use Robinhood to help manage their day-to-day spending needs, and then we could help them become investors over time. And we think that's an exciting market. And then there's always just the work in making our core experience better, making our core investing products better, making the flows and the user experience even stronger and getting customers to consequently refer their friends to Robinhood in greater numbers. So that's net new funded accounts. And as we've also mentioned, there's opportunities to increase ARPU and to monetize our accounts by giving them more functionality over time. And those include things like retirement and some of the other areas of focus through the year as well. Brokerage licenses overseas, yes. So we have a license by the FCA to operate brokerage business in the U.K., and that's right now the only international jurisdiction that we have a brokerage license for. Yes, I'd be happy to field that one. Certainly, the environment and regulatory regimes are different depending on where you're offering your products. We have a particular environment in the U.S., and we have a large U.S. business with crypto and the core brokerage. So regulatory compliance is at the center of everything that we do. We have to make sure that we operate prudently and work with our regulators. And overseas in some jurisdictions, the environment might be different. So yes, there will be opportunities to add products internationally that won't necessarily be available in the U.S. And I think vice versa is also the case. Yes. So this is a key area of focus for 2022. As I mentioned on the call earlier, taking our first-time investors and helping them become long-term investors is a big thread that we've been pulling on. You've seen that with recurring investments. ACATS-In also helps with that. And retirement and long-term automated investing is another area we're very closely looking at. So we expect to roll out in 2022. And we've heard lots of customer demand for this. They want multiple account types, including IRAs and Roths. And I think that, coupled with ACATS-In and the work that we've done in recurring this creates a meaningful opportunity to increase account balances. Yes. You bet. Yes. I wouldn't say that we've been prevented from adding any coins. I think what I'd say is that we've been proactively engaging with the regulators. They're concerned that a lot of these platforms that are adding a lot of coins may be adding unregistered securities and there's been a lot of scrutiny in the space as you've seen. So we're definitely being deliberate. We want to avoid triggering SEC registration requirements. Getting it wrong could harm users. So we are happy with the protocols we have in place, and we do intend to add more coins going forward, but we want to make sure we do it prudently. Thanks Will. Thanks everyone."

            "content": "Thanks, Vlad. 2021 was a strong year for our key metrics in revenues. Net funded accounts increased to $22.7 million, up 81% year-over-year. Monthly active users increased to 17.3 million, up 48% from December 2020 to December 2021. Assets under custody increased to $98 billion, up 56%. Total net revenues grew to $1.8 billion, up 89%. And adjusted EBITDA was $34 million. Additionally, we ended the year with over $6 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. We've never been in a stronger capital position as a company. Turning to Q4, we added 300,000 net funded accounts during the quarter. New funded accounts totaled 800,000; churned accounts totaled 700,000; and resurrected accounts totaled 200,000. For churn, we saw a 19% reduction compared to Q3, and on a percentage basis, churn hit its lowest mark in the last year and a half. Lastly, we had $4.4 billion in net deposits from customers for the quarter, up 93% sequentially but down 32% on a year-over-year basis. Now let's turn to revenue. Total net revenues were $363 million in Q4, up 14% year-over-year and in line sequentially. Our results for Q4 exceeded our previously communicated expectations as we saw stronger-than-anticipated trading activity. Transaction-based revenues were $264 million for the quarter, up 12% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Equities revenue was $52 million, down 35% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Options revenue was $163 million, up 14% year-over-year and roughly flat to Q3. And crypto revenue was $48 million, up 304% year-over-year but down 5% sequentially. As Vlad mentioned, in late December, we updated our pricing agreements with crypto market makers and added another venue to increase capacity and further improve competition for our customers. Our rebate, which is subject to change from time to time, more than doubled with these changes. As a reminder, this is the first time since launching our crypto business that we've updated the economic split between us and our venues. Looking at trading activities, there are a few call-outs. For equities trading, customers placing trades were up 21% year-over-year, which was offset by lower DARTs down 12% and lower notional volumes per trader down 43%. For options trading, customers placing trades were up 6% year-over-year, and options contracts per trader was up 20%, offset by lower DARTs, which were down 1%. And for crypto, customers placing trades were up 218% year-over-year. Crypto DARTs were up 176%, and notional volumes per trader increased 19%. Moving to assets under custody, equities was $72.1 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Options was $1.5 billion, which was down 28% as customers shifted their purchasing activity more towards short-dated positions. And crypto increased to $22.1 billion, up 528%. And for net revenues, they were $63 million for the quarter, up 1% year-over-year and in line sequentially. Primary components include securities lending, totaled $29 million was down 19% year-over-year and down 15% sequentially. We've been increasing the amount of securities loan to counterparties. However, market rate declines have more than offset these gains. As we look toward adding fully paid securities, we anticipate a significant opportunity to increase the monetization of this program. We believe fully paid securities lending at scale should be 1x to 2x times the size of margin securities lending, depending on opt-in rates by customers. Margin interest totaled $39 million in the quarter, up of 45% year-over-year. Our margin book closed out the year at $6.5 billion, a 93% increase versus the prior year. At the end of the quarter about 1% of our funded accounts maintained a margin balance. And interest expense was a $6 million offset to net interest revenues in Q4. As we anticipate fed rate increases during 2022, we expect that for every 25 basis points of rate increase, we'll generate approximately $40 million of additional annualized net interest revenue based on balances at year end 2021, while continuing to pass on value to customers. Moving to other revenues. They were $35 million in Q4 an 84% increase versus the prior year and in line with Q3. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by growth in our gold subscriptions and increased proxy delivery fees resulting from growth and assets under custody. As Vlad mentioned, we're working toward an enabling faster money movement for our customers. This represents a meaningful opportunity for us to earn service fees to the extent customers select this higher level of service. For context in 2021, customer withdrawals totaled $54 billion. Now for operating expenses. We finished the quarter with nearly 3,800 employees up 134% year-over-year and up 12% sequentially. During the quarter we made sequential progress, reducing fraud losses down 28% versus Q3. We've got more work to do here and this is constantly evolving. But I'm proud of the progress our teams are making. Lastly, our teams are working diligently to improve our operating leverage and efficiency. One area I'm particularly pleased with is web hosting, where the teams focused on efficiency and delivered a sequential improvement of 19% in Q4 versus Q3 for a savings of $15 million. Now let's turn to measures of profitability. Net loss for Q4 was $423 million, which includes $318 million in share base compensation. This compares to net income of $13 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $87 million compared with positive $79 million in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA primarily excludes the impact of share-based compensation. Before I get to our outlook, I'd like to mention that we've been carefully monitoring the behavior of our customers in this market environment. Since the start of the year, our customers have been continuing to deposit funds into their accounts on a net basis, but they've been making fewer trades and in smaller amounts. In these first few weeks of the New Year, we're seeing trading activity below what we saw in Q4 of 2021. However, in the few days leading up to our call, we've seen some higher levels of engagement, net deposits and trading versus the start of the year. It's too soon to say whether what we've seen these last few days will be a sustained trend or not. And so for Q1, we're anticipating that total net revenues will be less than $340 million, which assumes some incremental improvement in trading volumes versus what we've seen so far. At the top end, this implies a year-over-year revenue decline of 35%. As a reminder in Q1 last year, we had outsized revenue due to heightened trading activity, particularly relating to certain mean stocks. Now for full year 2022 operating expenses. We expect total operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation to increase between 15% and 20% year-over-year. Additionally, we expect share-based compensation to decline between 35% and 40% year-over-year. During 2022, we expect a meaningfully slow or hiring pace as we grow into the larger workforce we've built over the past two years. While we exited 2021 with a higher run rate for employee compensation costs, we expect these costs to be partially offset as we begin realizing efficiencies across several areas of our business. We expect to realize improvements in such areas as customer service, cloud, web hosting and fraud losses as we focus on productivity and benefit from our increasing scale and investments we're making in technology. Actual results for total operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation may differ materially from our outlook due to several factors, including the rate of growth in net new funded accounts, which affect several costs, including variable marketing costs. The degree to which we are successful in preventing fraud, our ability to manage web hosting expenses efficiently and our ability to achieve productivity improvements in customer service among other factors. With that Irv, let's move to Q&A. Thanks for the question. Our primary measure internally for profitability is adjusted EBITDA. We actually, for the full year 2021 had a small positive adjusted EBITDA. When we look forward, it's possible that we'll have a positive adjusted EBITDA in 2022, but we've got a much better line of sight for that in 2023. It's obviously going to depend on a few things, including overall market conditions and how well we execute against the new product roadmap. It's also going to be impacted by how effective we are at managing our costs, which we're definitely committed to do. Yeah, thanks for the question, Peter. It's a number of factors and some of it is certainly on us at Robinhood and some of it is the general market. Clearly the fed signaling, increasing rates along with inflation. We've seen a rotation away from growth stocks, like Robinhood it's affected the industry, but it's absolutely affected our shares as well. But there's also things that we need to be doing and it's questions around our strategy, our speed of execution and also I think providing just additional clarity about what we're working on and when you should expect progress from us. And we've been trying very hard in this call and in the materials that we're sharing today to give you a really good insight into the roadmap and also the expected timing and impact of our roadmap. So we're working on it. We're going to stay as Vlad mentioned, focused on the long term, but we're definitely very optimistic about where we can go from here. I'll start, and then I think Vlad will probably jump in. Thanks, Ross, for the questions. In terms of the expectation for future adds, what I would say is we think that there's a significant opportunity ahead of us, starting first with the U.S. and investing to have more customers join the platform. We've done some internal research. It suggests that of the demographic of 18- to 49-year-olds, a little over half have a brokerage account. And in our research, it suggests that currently, there's about 10 million or more that are currently don't have an account and are interested in participating in the stock market. There's a long-term trend of increasing retail participation, and we think that's a great place to be able to leverage and participate. We also have opportunity, I think, as Vlad mentioned, with the road map to generate interest in new customers with the other products and also international is an even bigger opportunity, we believe, over the long-term. Vlad, I'll turn it to you for kind of areas we're most excited about. His last question was brokerage licenses. Yes. Thanks, Ken. Great question. On a typical day, the vast majority of that is not needed to support our business. Since last year around the surges that we saw, obviously, we raised cash, but we also opened up increasing lines of credit as well. And so to support the trading, it's not just the corporate cash that we have, but also lines of credit. Additionally, we substantially increased the capital at the clearing broker, and the level of capitalization actually affects the calculation of how much deposits you have to put on \u2013 put for the clearinghouse. In fact, right now, we're over 20x above the required capital for our clearing brokers. So we're looking very solid. As I said, the vast majority of our corporate cash is not needed on a daily basis. And there's things that we can do from a process perspective, particularly around funding buying activity and selling activity over weekends for crypto that will further alleviate the need for the cash. So we're sitting in a really good spot. We've got more that we can do, and we feel great that we're in a position to make sure we can handle customer trades no matter the environment. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ken. The biggest components are around \u2013 obviously, corporate cash, we just talked about having over $6 billion there. That will certainly be affected by a rising interest rate environment. Free credit balances from customers those balances fluctuate, but it's many billion \u2013 over $6 billion of customer margin balances as well. There's also anticipated that will be some earnings from rising interest rate on the collateral that we receive on the securities lending program, which is also a few billions. So those are the biggest components. Yes. You're welcome. Yes. Devin, thanks for the question. What I would say is we provided some indication on when to expect some of these products to roll out, and then there's going to be ramp-up time for customer adoption as well. And so it's going to be back half of the year loaded and into 2023. And also, certainly, our revenue for the year is going to depend on the overall market environment for trading. But we're particularly excited about the fully paid stock lending program, which we're expecting to be able to roll out kind of mid-year that can have a meaningful impact, one to 2x the size of our margin securities business. We're kind of thinking internally that it's going to take several months for that to ramp. So just to give you a sense on that. Excited also about offering customers the ability to move their money faster. And we haven't talked about the monetization yet for \u2013 particularly for withdrawals, but we do anticipate to see some uplift in revenue to the extent customers choose to move their money faster. But definitely for new products, I would say it's back of the year weighted and getting more momentum in 2023. Yes. So it's \u2013 we have to work closely with FINRA to make sure that they understand the program and the terms and all the operational details of the program. We're meeting with them proactively and making sure that we're \u2013 have a common understanding of how the product will be introduced. We aren't at the point to share the economic split with customers, but we do see this as an opportunity for customers to get enhanced yield on their portfolios. In terms of like the impact to the company, it's going to depend on the adoption rate. It is an attractive opportunity for customers. So there's a good opportunity, I think, for us to see a nice customer uptake on the program. And we think it could be one to 2x the size of our margin securities lending business at scale. Yes, and Craig, we're signaling for the retirement accounts that we'll start rolling that out in midyear. Yes. Thanks, Will, for the question. So the rebate did more than double. It was effective really at the beginning of this year. And all else being equal, you'd expect the revenue to fall in line. We have seen, as I mentioned at the beginning of the year, slower trading levels but for the last several days leading into the call, and that's what we use to inform the guidance that we gave. And in terms of whether it's \u2013 yes. Sorry, you asked Will, about the sustainability of it. We do expect from time to time that these will be negotiated. But I think that we feel really good about the level that we're at now. Yes. We're kind of assuming it's going to take up to about five months to get the program ramped. It's hard to know exactly how long it'll take that may prove to be conservative. And we may prove to not be conservative enough by a few months, but that's kind of the, the general way we're thinking about the timing for that. And look, I think there's \u2013 I think there's a lot of interesting opportunities that can contribute to revenue in the areas that we're talking about. Certainly international crypto could be one of those areas we talked about fully paid securities lending. Our spending product, obviously depending on adoption could be also a meaningful way to not just earn revenue, but attract new customers. So I really think that this is an opportunity that has many components. And we're really excited about that one. One other thing that we actually didn't talk about in the call, you've probably heard me in the past talk about Robinhood Gold and the subscription opportunity. We've assembled a team and we're building a plan and are excited relatively soon to start adding value into our Robinhood Gold subscription. And I think that that in particular, if we do that right can add a lot of positive synergy to the platform and the customer experience. Yes, Rich, we're in, as I said a much better position including capitalizing the broker dealer 20x or more off the regulatory required amounts. We also run as you would expect stress scenarios, and those include events that look like what we saw a year ago. And so we need to make sure that we're comfortable that no matter what the trading environment is that we can support our customers. Now, there's more efficient ways to accomplish that than just parking a bunch of cash on your balance sheet. And like I said, we've made some progress with our lines of credit. And there's some operation things that we can do to help fund the crypto business more efficiently, particularly over weekends. Over time I'd like to see us having a working capital structure \u2013 a capital structure that is more balanced between debt and equity. So that's something that we'll think about over time. But we're also a growth company and we've got big ambitions. And so I think it makes sense that we have enough dry powder to be able to pursue those growth opportunities. And so that's kind of how we're thinking about it \u2013 it's evolving and as we get better with our procedures and get access to more lines of credit, it'll give us even more flexibility. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Steve. So the guidance is a meaningful slowdown versus how we've been growing these last couple of years our cost basis. It is assuming a deceleration of hiring, which is owing to the fact that we've more than doubled each of the last couple of years and really find ourselves in a great position across the board, whether it's engineering and product, which are important for doing new things and compliance and customer service with 24/7. And so really across the board, we feel really good about the team that we've assembled so much so that we can grow at a much, much slower rate, and then looking across \u2013 across the business there's this opportunity for us to be more efficient and use technology to deliver greater productivity. And so I mentioned briefly just the progress we're making on web hosting. It's a meaningful expense line item for us, down sequentially about $15 million and there's more opportunity there. And we have line of sight on that even in Q1 and through the rest of the year. Greater opportunity to be even more efficient serving our customers through customer support, a big piece of that is just kind of relentlessly identifying reasons why customers have to contact us in the first place and solve those issues at the root. Give customers an ability to self-serve, making it to where that we can \u2013 we can take the team that we have and focus on the really higher level challenges and questions that our customers have so that the paper cuts if you will that are on the platform today just get resolved or handled directly by customers, which is a much better path for them and to get a quick resolution. So it's really those kinds of efforts that we're made that's going to drive kind of leverage in the business. In terms of kind of the payback time and how we're thinking about investments, we're able to for the most part in our engineering team focus incremental investments on kind of the new things. We as I said made just a lot of progress on staffing the teams and so we feel really, really good about incremental investments contributing to the business. Yes. So definitely when stock prices decline there'll be some level of margin calls and margin maintenance from customers. Given the collateral that we that \u2013 we have in our program and the timeliness of those kinds of margin calls we're not experiencing any meaningful losses on that at all. Thank you. Appreciate the questions."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Head of Capital Markets and Investor Relations, Irvin Sha. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Sha: Welcome everyone, and thank you for joining us for Robinhood's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today are CEO and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev; and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements about Robinhood's outlook for the fourth quarter as well as our strategic and operational plans. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations. Potential risk factors that could cause differences are described in our press release issued this afternoon; the related slide presentation on our Investor Relations website; our Form 10-Q filed August 18, 2021; and in our other SEC filings. All information on the call is as of today October 26, 2021, and we undertake no duty to update it for subsequent events except as required by law. As we discuss our results, all percentage growth comparisons will be to the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investors.robinhood.com. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad. \nVlad Tenev: Thanks Irv, and thank you all for joining. Let me first start by discussing growth. In Q3, net cumulative funded accounts were 22.4 million, up 97% year-over-year and slightly off versus Q2. As we previewed last quarter, in Q3, we saw considerably fewer new funded accounts and lower revenue as compared to Q2. In Q3, we added 660,000 new funded accounts bringing our total additions for the year to 11.4 million nearly doubling our customer base since the end of last year. It's been an incredible year and we are still very early in our journey of democratizing finance for all. Looking back at Q2, we saw a huge interest in crypto, especially Doge leading to large numbers of new customers joining the platform and record revenues. In Q3, crypto activity came off record highs leading to fewer new funded accounts and lower revenue as expected. Historically, our growth has come in waves. The surges have come during periods of increased volatility or market events. We've also seen that new customers join when we add new products and features giving us some degree of control over our growth. Going forward we expect to see these patterns persist. Jason will talk more about growth, our financials and our fourth quarter outlook in just a moment. For more than a year, we've devoted a significant majority of our resources to safety first initiatives, most notably platform stability and service reliability. We've seen massive increases in new customers and trading activity over the past year, and I believe we have never been in a better position to serve these new customers. We've also made huge strides in expanding our pool of top engineering talent. With the progress we've made on those two fronts, we think we now have much greater flexibility to allocate resources to new product development, and we're starting to see the results from that. As I did last time, I'd like to cover our progress, organized by our values. As a reminder, our top values are safety first, participation is power, radical customer focus and first principles thinking. Beginning with safety first. We've continued to make substantial progress on customer support and educational content. We want Robinhood to be the most trusted financial institution. This will take time, but we believe we are making good progress. For example, I'm incredibly proud that we successfully rolled out 24/7 live phone support in our app. Customers can request a call back at any time of the day for help on any topic. And I'm really excited to say that our support team also serves crypto, making us the first major crypto platform to provide 24/7 live phone support. We're also heavily leveraging proprietary technology to increase the efficiency of this service. Our interactive triage flow can pinpoint where support is needed, connecting customers with a representative who can provide a fast and personalized resolution. Our next step is to expand phone support to customers, who aren't in the app. We're working on this, and plan to roll it out in the coming months. We're also continuing to build educational content that helps new investors become long-term investors. Following last quarter's rollout of in-app educational modules, we've added more tools and features that help our customers better understand the market investing and our app, all in ways that are contextually relevant for them. For example, to help customers learn more about options, we will soon enable them to set-up hypothetical trades, and see how their trades perform over time. This gives customers a way to gain practical knowledge and confidence, before investing their money. We're also beginning to integrate Robinhood Snacks, our digestible financial news content directly into our app. Snacks is one of the most widely consumed financial newsletters with over 23 million unique readers in Q3. We're excited to deliver this content to more and more of our customers, to help them stay informed of the top financial news. Over time, we'll be finding more ways to integrate Snacks with Robinhood. We think there are a lot of exciting synergies here. And we've entered into our first big content distribution partnership making Robinhood Snacks available on Snapchat to their millions of users. Together, we have created one of the first finance education channels delivered on Snap's Discover tab. We're really excited to extend the reach of Robinhood Snacks and are pleased to be working with the team at Snap. Now, turning to participation is power. We have continued expanding access to financial markets for all our customers. Customers are really loving the ability to participate in IPOs through Robinhood. As of today, we've partnered with 12 companies across a wide range of industries that have made their IPOs available to Robinhood customers. Six of these companies have crossed 30 days since their listing on the platform, and we continue to see our customers holding over 80% of their allotted shares 30 days post-IPO. This gives us confidence that more and more issuers will view our platform as a great way to reach retail shareholders. In this quarter, we began integrating, Say events into our application, giving customers improved access to annual shareholder meetings, product launch events, and company Q&A forums. Just this month, for the first time Robinhood customers used Say to ask questions that were then answered live during an annual shareholder meeting. Going forward, we see an opportunity to continue building on this momentum to revolutionize the way retail shareholders connect with the companies they own. This is truly an exciting moment for retail investors.  On to radical customer focus, we've been ramping up the pace of product development this quarter. We've opened the wait list for crypto wallets. This has been one of the most requested features from our customers and we're excited that over one million customers have signed up to date. We're making our wallet features simple, and intuitive, and expect to begin introducing this to customers in the coming weeks. We also introduced recurring investments for crypto, which is a great way for customers to automatically build their positions over time, without having to stress about timing the market. And of course, we are very excited to offer our crypto customers 24/7 live phone support directly from the app. I should mention, we are keeping a close eye on crypto as the regulatory landscape is increasingly uncertain. We're aiming to deliver great new crypto features for customers, while being mindful of keeping our platform safe and introducing products that comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Crypto is still very early, and we're excited to be investing in our platform here. Looking ahead, I'd like to share a few upcoming products and features that we're excited about. Just last week, we started rolling out our new Recommendations engine, which will help the new customers select their first investment. This feature not only helps our customers get started, but also helps educate them on things like ETFs, and the importance of diversification. We're also getting very close to making it possible for customers to transfer existing investments from other brokerages into Robinhood. This is called ACATS-In. And until now, our ACATS functionality has only been available for outbound transfers. This will change that, and I'm eager to see this launch. And finally, before I turn this over to Jason, I'd like to highlight that as part of our new product road map, we're committed to delivering tax-advantaged accounts for retirement. We know this is important for our customers, and our teams are hard at work to make this a reality. We aren't ready yet to provide a time line, but we look forward to updating you on our progress. We're still very early in our journey. We're continuing to invest for the long term, and remain focused on our vision of building a single-money app for our customers. With that, let me turn it over to Jason to discuss our financial results.\nJason Warnick: Thanks Vlad. In Q3, net cumulative funded accounts were 22.4 million, up 97% year-over-year and slightly down versus Q2. Monthly active users were 18.9 million up 76% year-over-year. And assets under custody were $95.4 billion, up 115% year-over-year. MAU and AUC each declined sequentially, off a record Q2. During the quarter, we added 660,000 new funded accounts bringing our total additions for the year to 11.4 million. Churn was 870,000 accounts, improving on a percentage basis versus the first two quarters of 2021. I'm happy to see churn come back more in line with what we were seeing in 2020. And offsetting churn 110,000 customers returned to Robinhood during the quarter. Also in Q3 customers contributed $2.3 billion in net deposits. Now let's turn to revenue. Total net revenues were $365 million in Q3, up 35% year-over-year but down sequentially, as expected. Looking at the components of revenue, transaction-based revenues were $267 million in Q3 which is down sequentially, but up 32% year-over-year. Equities revenue was $50 million down 27% year-over-year. Options revenue was $164 million up 29%. And crypto revenue was $51 million up 860% year-over-year. While crypto came off record highs from Q2, it significantly exceeded last year's Q3 level. Looking at trading activities, there are a few call-outs. Customers placing trades were up year-over-year, 24% for equities, 11% for options, and 287% for crypto. During the quarter, equities DARTs were down 4% year-over-year, option starts were flat and crypto DARTs were up 340%. Notional volumes traded per trader were down 39% for equities, and up 124% for crypto, while average options contracts per trader were up 18%. Moving to assets under custody, equities AUC was $69 billion up 83%. Options AUC was $1.4 billion up 4%, and crypto AUC increased to $22 billion versus $1.1 billion in the prior year. As a reminder, the crypto currency market is extremely volatile. And we anticipate these conditions are likely to persist. As for cash management the product continues to get traction reaching 5.5 million customers, up 293% year-over-year. 25% of our funded customer accounts now use our cash management product. And this is an area we are excited to keep investing in. Moving to net interest revenues, they were $63 million for the quarter up 26%. Primary components include securities lending which totaled $33 million up 20% year-over-year but down sequentially, margin interest which totaled $34 million in the quarter up 61% year-over-year and interest expense which was a $6 million offset to net interest revenues in Q3. Our margin book reached $6.1 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 168%. At the end of the quarter 256,000 customers held a margin balance representing about 1% of our net cumulative funded accounts. And for other revenues, they increased 101% to $34 million, driven largely by year-over-year growth in our gold subscriptions. Now for operating expenses, I'd like to remind you that beginning with our IPO, we are now recording share-based compensation from RSUs within each of our operating expense line items. In total, our share-based compensation for Q3, totaled $1.2 billion, which includes a cumulative charge totaling $1 billion recorded at the time of the IPO. It will make our year-over-year comparisons for OpEx a bit challenging, so I encourage you to check out the investor presentation for details on SBC included in each operating line. We continue to make progress building our teams with increases primarily in engineering, customer service, and our regulatory and compliance teams. In the quarter, we added 580 new full-time employees across the company growing 21% sequentially versus Q2. We made sequential progress reducing fraud losses down 23% versus Q2. We have more work to do here and this is constantly evolving but I'm proud of the progress our teams have made. Lastly the team is working diligently to improve our operating leverage and efficiency. This is a long-term cultural commitment for us and I'm confident we will deliver on this. Now, let's turn to measures of profitability. Net loss for Q3 was $1.32 billion, which includes the $1.2 billion in share-based compensation. This compares to a net loss of $11 million in the prior year quarter. And adjusted EBITDA was negative $84 million compared with positive $59 million in the prior year quarter. As a reminder adjusted EBITDA primarily excludes the impact of share-based comp. Now for Q4. We anticipate that total revenue will be less than $325 million and full year revenue will be less than $1.8 billion. At the top end this implies full year revenue growth of 85%. Additionally, we expect new funded accounts in Q4 will be roughly in line with Q3. As you know the market is uncertain and could be highly volatile. So, these comments are assuming a steady state for what we've seen so far in these first few weeks of the quarter and do not assume any changes to market volatility or incorporate any anticipation of exogenous events. As a reminder, our industry sees a typical seasonality curve that shows higher growth in the first quarter of the year versus the last three quarters. Additionally, we continue to monitor regulatory developments relating to market structure matters such as statements from the SEC on payment for order flow, cryptocurrency regulation, option trading due diligence, and digital engagement practices. We remain focused on the long term and we're very excited about our product roadmap. We are introducing the next generation to investing and all things money and we believe there's a big opportunity ahead of us. With that, Irv, let's turn to Q&A.\nA - Irvin Sha: Thanks Jason. Leading into this quarter's Q&A session, we'll start again by answering the top questions from Say ranked by the number of votes. We'll pass over any questions that were already addressed and we'll group together questions that share a common theme. After that, we'll turn to live questions from the analyst community. Starting off, we have a number of questions from [indiscernible], Christian B, [indiscernible], and others around our plans and timeline for future crypto offerings including new coins and earning interest on crypto. Vlad, do you have any color you'd like to share there?\nVlad Tenev: Of course. Yes, thank you for your questions. And we know that the community is really excited to see more features in our crypto offering. We hear this loud and clear. Our customers want new coins, the ability to deposit and withdraw, as well as ways to earn interest under crypto. And as we mentioned in the release, we're excited about crypto wallets. Over 1 million customers are on the wait-list for crypto wallets thus far and this is coming soon. So, on new coins specifically, one thing to mention is that crypto wallets will allow customers to participate and take coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that they purchased on Robinhood to participate in some of the other decentralized applications off-platform which allow access to coins that we don't offer. So, we actually believe that by rolling out wallets we will go a long way towards addressing the primary pain point that customers feel right now. One other thing that we're mindful of and I noticed this -- I mentioned this earlier in the release. The regulatory environment in terms of new coins and lending products in crypto is uncertain and evolving. And we're having to carefully evaluate whether we can add new coins in a way that's safe for customers and in line with regulatory requirements. So as you probably are aware the Securities and Exchange Commission other regulators have raised questions about whether lending and staking features are actually unregistered securities offerings, whether a lot of the coins at and tokens at other platforms are unregistered securities. And we feel very, very good about the coins that we're currently listing on our platform. And for any new coins that we add we want to feel equally if not more good. So we're going to be very careful. We're a regulated entity and we're hopeful to get some clarity soon on coins. So until then we'll continue to work with our regulators to hopefully land in a place where regulations allow for innovation and are applied evenly across the industry. The only other thing I'd mention is that we've been investing a lot in the crypto team. The team started out a year ago as a fairly small team. They've done a lot of great work scaling the platform. And they've rolled out a lot of really exciting features so not just the wallet wait list, but also recurring and 24/7 phone support. And we're excited to keep innovating in this space and there's much more to come here.\nIrvin Sha: Great. Thanks. From Tushar T [ph], when will Robinhood support retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs? \nVlad Tenev: Yes, I'll field this one too. Thank you, Tushar. So as we mentioned we are committed to support retirement accounts, IRAs specifically in the product road map. We don't have specific details on time line yet, but I will tell you it's very much in line with our mission. We want to see everybody being an investor and tax-advantaged accounts do a lot and are important for customers as a way to encourage long-term investing behavior. So it's something we're excited about. We know it's mission aligned and we can't wait to deliver a great product for our customers there.\nIrvin Sha: Great. Next up we have questions from Maxfield S [ph] and Edward A [ph] on whether we have any plans for extending trading hours both before the market open and after hours. \nVlad Tenev: Yes. Thank you for this question. This is something we've heard a little bit. So we do offer some extended trading hours right now but are hearing from customers that they want those hours extended. So just some of the challenges in doing this: limited liquidity and wide spreads. So we want to make sure that we communicate to customers that conditions outside of normal trading hours may differ. And I think this is incredibly important, especially, given that many of our customers are investing for the first time. That said we do hear customers on this and I'm happy to say that teams are actively working on this. So you should be hearing more from us on this in the coming months.\nIrvin Sha: Sounds good. From Jason L [ph], how is Robinhood planning on becoming profitable long-term in competing with Square et cetera? Maybe Jason do you want to take this one?\nJason Warnick: Yes, happy to take this. What I'd tell you right now is that we're really focused on investing for the future. And so you see us investing heavily in our teams adding to the teams like engineering and customer support. And you're going to continue to see us investing for the future and not really focus on profitability at least in the near term. What I will say though is when I look at our operating structure I feel really good about our unit economics. I think we're set up to be a profitable company over the long-term, but right now that's just not our focus. In terms of competition what I'd tell you is that I think we're really well-positioned to keep building for customers. And that's going to be adding products and features that our customers love add values that are great for customers. And over time we think that that combined with our brand and our focus on safety first will help us be very competitive in the market. \nIrvin Sha: Great. From Ramone D [ph] when will the Robinhood wallet be available to all? \nVlad Tenev: Well, thank you for the question. So this is one that we're excited to talk about. We've been making good progress on the wallets and we're going to be rolling out to the first set of external customers in the next few weeks. So one of the interesting things about this rollout getting to this point has taken a lot of great work from the teams. So we're using this as an opportunity to make an experience that's traditionally been very cumbersome and complicated and scary to some customers. Easy and intuitive while also introducing security hygiene in a way that's understandable. So we anticipate the first launch, the first set of external customers to get a high-quality product. But moreover we're excited to continue building this in public with the community. So even though we want to give people a high-quality product as the first set of customers, we'll take their feedback and report back to the community about what that feedback is and incorporate that into the product while it's rolling out. So we do think the product will continue to improve and we're excited to share the progress with the community. So we -- the aim is nothing short of rolling out the easiest to use, safest and most delightful wallet experience for our customers. So next few weeks first set of external customers; and we expect to have wallets available to all customers in Q1 of next year.\nIrvin Sha: Excellent. From Bryan H [ph], how will Robinhood continue to generate income without PFOF? Jason?\nJason Warnick: Yeah. So PFOF has been getting quite a bit of regulatory attention including specific comments from Chair Gensler talking about banning PFOF being on the table. I do think it's important to step back when thinking about PFOF to consider where we've come from. Robinhood led the way in commission free trading and that's led across the industry to save billions of dollars for investors. And millions of people are participating who previously weren't including just a much more inclusive and diverse population of investors. And so we really think that as this question of PFOF has looked at, we hope that as the SEC looks at the data that they'll see the benefits that PFOF has brought to the industry and to the millions of people who are now participating. Now in terms of the question, I do think that over time we're going to be rolling out more products and services. We talked a little bit about retirement accounts. We're investing in our cash management product and certainly crypto. And so we'll be diversifying our product selection over time. And I would say that there's also an opportunity for us to participate more in the market making of the order flow as I mentioned last quarter. So lots of opportunities for us over time, and on PFOF we're certainly paying close attention.\nIrvin Sha: Great. Maybe time for one more question. So this one comes from Brandon C [ph]. Can you make an option to gift stocks to family and friends? Vlad?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. Thank you, Brandon. This is something that we hear from customers from time-to-time. We don't have anything to share about gifting stocks on the road map right now. But stay tuned and this is definitely something that we'll consider for the future.\nIrvin Sha: Great. And with that I will ask the operator to open up the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good afternoon Vlad, Jason and Irvin. I guess, first question here I'd love to just maybe unpack the outlook a bit for the fourth quarter in a couple of points. I guess, the first one on the comment on revenues. I appreciate there's a lot of uncertainty as we think about the next couple of months here, but it does seem like crypto volume's up meaningfully at least in the industry. So I'm assuming maybe there's some offsets or maybe you guys are seeing that. I'm just, kind of, curious if you can give a little more color around what you're seeing in the revenue environment. And then in terms of new funded accounts, I appreciate how strong the first half was. But is the back half of the year and maybe even what you see in the fourth quarter, is that a function of just pulling back a bit on marketing because it's just not as attractive or no big product launches, or how should we think about just the outlook for new funded accounts relative to the marketing spend?\nJason Warnick: Yeah. Thanks Devin and I appreciate the question. This is Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. The first comment that I'd make on the revenue guidance is that it's based on what we've seen for just a few short weeks at the beginning of the quarter. It's assuming that we don't see any changes in market volatility and no kind of exogenous events if you will in the market. And we wanted to be, what we felt was appropriately conservative for our revenue guidance, particularly in the fact that we are facing seasonal headwinds and lower year-over-year volatility. In terms of crypto, it's very difficult to predict, what we'll see. But what we did is incorporate what we've seen for the first couple of weeks of the quarter and incorporated that into the guidance. In terms of your question on marketing, I think that's a good one. When we look at marketing, particularly in environments where there is just generally lower volatility and less interest in investing, we've decided as a company to be cautious about chasing growth with marketing dollars. You can always spend more to get more customers, but what we've seen is you tend to get lower-intent customers at worse economics, in these periods where there's just lower volatility and less interest. And that said, I think the opposite is also true that in periods of higher volatility, and higher interest in trading, we tend to lean a little bit more into it. And of course, as you know, we've got a tremendous referral network. And we love the effectiveness of that. But, you should just expect as a management team, we're going to be cautious with the way that we approach our marketing dollars, so that the economics make sense as well as the customers who join us have high intent.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Thanks, Jason. And just a follow-up here on the IPO Access business, some really nice I think momentum there with 12 deals already so clearly some pretty good proof of concept. How do you guys see that progressing from here? What type of momentum do you have in the pipeline or conversations with companies? And then, is the next step to be able to actually increase allocation? So you're getting on many more deals, but do you see a scenario where you can actually get a larger piece where you're a more meaningful piece of every deal?\nJason Warnick: Yeah. Thanks Devin. What I would say is it's still very early in the IPO Access product. What we've seen so far is incredibly encouraging. You heard the stats that Vlad had mentioned. As we've talked to potential issuers, particularly early on there was just a question of well how will Robinhood customers respond to receiving an allocation? Will they just quickly trade for a quick profit, or are they really in it for the longer term? And what we're seeing is that, our customers are holding on to the shares. And that's a really strong signal to issuers. And stepping back, just looking at the relationship between retail investors and the companies that they own, IPO Access is an important piece of that. I think the work that we're doing with Say, is also important. And what we're trying to do is, really revolutionize the way that investors are able to communicate with the companies that they own. And ultimately, be able to influence their policies and roadmaps and so on. So, really excited about the momentum there, our vision is that, the vast majority of IPOs should be made available to retail investors. And I think we're building a strong case that Robinhood should be the conduit for that.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I would just add, I think Jason really put it well. We think that Robinhood is very well positioned to create an ecosystem between shareholders and the companies that they're investing in. You see through participating in the IPOs, to investing post-IPO, to engaging with the management teams like on the Say platform, people are really becoming and behaving like owners in these enterprises. And we think that's a very positive thing for our economy, for these companies, and the broader landscape. So we're excited to invest more here.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Will Nance of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nWill Nance: Hi guys. Good evening.\nVlad Tenev: Good evening.\nJason Warnick: Hi Will.\nWill Nance: I guess, maybe, I can start off with just a follow-up on some of the account trends that you saw this quarter. I mean, the attrition that we saw in net funded accounts, I mean is the attrition concentrated in some of the more recent vintages i.e. maybe some of the accounts that kind of opened around meme stocks and doge coin earlier in the year? I mean any color on attrition rates on kind of pre-2021 cohorts?\nJason Warnick: Yes. Will, when we kind of looked across the attrition that we've seen, not just in this period, but in prior periods, there really aren't any concentrations to call out. We feel great about the attrition rate, particularly as it's coming back down to more normalized levels. We did see higher attrition at the beginning of the year around some of the market events. But again, as we look at the cohorts and the demographics of the churning customers, we're not seeing any concentrations. And one thing that I'd really like to see is returning customers and having 110,000 customers come back to us this period was also really encouraging. We've seen that time and again that when customers have churned then we get a fairly good percentage of them coming back to us over time. And I think that the work that we're doing around safety first, certainly, all the improvements that we've made to our platform and site resiliency, but also the 24/7 phone support goes straight to customer trust. And we think that that over time is going to make a meaningful impact to churn.\nWill Nance: Got it. Helpful. Appreciate that. And then maybe as a follow-up just on the product pipeline for crypto. I guess, given some of the regulatory scrutiny, it sounds like maybe some of the newer products in crypto could be on hold. I'm just -- you guys have talked about prioritization in the past and I know you have a lot on your plate in terms of new products that you could go after. I'm just kind of wondering how this is impacting the pipeline and whether there's kind of a reprioritization. Any new products outside of crypto that maybe come to mind as maybe taking more of a center stage, given some of the overhangs around crypto?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. I would just start, this is Vlad, by saying that, I think, we're still quite early in the crypto space and Robinhood sees a lot of opportunity ahead of us. So the wallets wait list where we're rolling that out, looking forward to getting that out to customers in the coming weeks. And I think that unlocks an entirely new segment of the crypto space for Robinhood and for our customers. They'll be able to send crypto off-platform and really get access to the broader ecosystem that way. Recurring crypto, we're very excited to see that come out. And that's been a requested feature and something that allows customers to dollar cost average into crypto and not be as concerned about price volatility. And 24/7 phone support for crypto, which is very unique in the space. So we're certainly a long way from being finished with the crypto road map. We're closer to the beginning. And we see a ton of opportunity ahead of us to continue to deliver value to customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You attributed softer account openings to crypto. As we look at the account attrition this quarter, it was still at least reasonably elevated. Are you seeing the attrition in crypto accounts too? And if we look at 3Q, any sense of what portion of the attrition was coming from customers who are, A, cutting their accounts versus customers whose assets were going to zero? And then to follow up on -- oh, gosh, I think it might have been Will's question before, or -- in terms of account growth. In 2019 and 2020, account growth was still reasonably good in the second half of those years. And I hear what you're saying about seasonality, but it also seems like Robinhood sort of grew through that seasonality in prior years. And particularly, I think it was in 2019 that realized volatility was substantially lower than what we're seeing in October today. So is there something else going on beyond seasonality or volatility that might be weighing on growth? Thanks.\nJason Warnick: Yes. Thanks, Ken. Appreciate the questions. Similar to the -- my earlier comments on attrition, we're not seeing any concentrations, including at a product level, that would suggest that there's any specific source of concentration in the attrition that we're seeing. In terms of ACATS, we saw that come down over 30% versus the ACATS that we saw in Q2, so really good progress there. I think that's really owing to -- we had a volatile first half of the year, elevated attrition, elevated ACATS out. I think what we're seeing now is it's beginning to normalize. And I think that the efforts, that we're putting into safety first is certainly contributing to that normalization of departures. In terms of account growth, at a macro level what I would tell you is that, we don't expect our growth to be linear. And we certainly have seasonal headwinds right now. There's lower volatility by nearly 30% year-over-year. Both of those headwinds are absolutely contributing to what we're seeing. There's nothing else that I would point to. We look at our share of our new app downloads. That continues to be strong and we're taking an outsized share. So, what I'd tell you is that we expect kind of our growth not to be linear. It should ebb and flow with market conditions. The things that we can control are really new product launches and making sure customers have just a great experience when they're here. So, really continuing to be very optimistic. There's a long-term trend of increasing retail participation, and I think we're positioned really well to benefit from that.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. And I would just add to that that over the past 1.5 years through the pandemic and the first part of 2020, we've been a little bit on our back foot coping with the huge growth in new customers and trading revenue. And we've had to allocate significant resources towards scaling and improving operations and customer support. So, the benefit of slightly reduced volatility is that we have a lot more breathing room to work on new products and features for customers. And so we're excited to deliver those and we think that customers will really enjoy what we're coming out with.\nKen Worthington: Thank you very much.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Good evening, Vlad, and good evening, Jason. I was just going to ask and you did include a lot in the earnings release. But is there any way you could walk us through Jason, the lockup release? And I know it has a lot of what we call legalese, but a little bit more simplified of what comes unlocked over the next couple of days as well as the next five weeks.\nJason Warnick: Happy to Rich. And as is pretty customary with IPOs, as we all know, we all have to deal with lockup releases and the implications to float. So just kind of at the highest level, we have about 68 million tradable shares that are out on the market today. Tomorrow on October 27, we have half of what we call Tranche I of the converts becoming unlocked as well as some shares from employees that unlock according to the lockup schedule. So that's 49 million shares relating to the shares received on Tranche I of the converts and another 13 million shares. That will be subject to trading windows of course relating to employees. So, roughly 62 million on tomorrow that will come out. So, 68 million right now, about 62 million coming out tomorrow. And then fast forward to November 10, and then the other 49 million, so the other half of Tranche I shares will begin be tradable. So that will be another 49 million. And then you move forward to December 1, and that's where all shares will be now fully tradable.\nRich Repetto: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Thanks, Jason.\nJason Warnick: You bet.\nRich Repetto: And Vlad, just one follow-up question on the new funded account stuff. You're very helpful and given us sort of the dogecoin breakout in the second quarter. And you got a great contribution from the trading activity there. And I was just wondering, whether do you follow like how many new funded accounts, or do you think from that came from this the big uptick in dogecoin in 2Q?\nVlad Tenev: In Q2, sure yes. Yes, there were millions of new funded accounts that came for cryptocurrencies, particularly dogecoin in Q2. So certainly, it was a meaningful portion of the new accounts in that period. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your line is open. \nJosh Beck: Thank you too for taking the question. I wanted to go back to the crypto wallet launch. Obviously it's really encouraging to see that type of wait list at this stage of the product. But as it's launched what do you really think will be the distinctive elements of the offering versus maybe some of the other wallets that are out there? \nVladimir Tenev: Yes, for sure. I think that we're going to start with simplicity and security. We really want customers to know not just wallets, but Robinhood in general as the safest most trusted and easiest to use place to work with your investments in crypto. And I think wallets is really no different. I think that a lot of products in the market are complex. They're tricky to use. They make customers nervous when they're transacting crypto and sending it back and forth. So I think we can really bring our design and engineering to bear on some of these problems. And it's not going to be just a single launch. As I mentioned earlier in one of the answers to the retail questions, we're excited to build this in public and to solicit feedback. And we think that the product will keep getting better and better. And based on that feedback, we'll continue to solve customers' pain points and improve the experience. \nJosh Beck: Great. Well, look forward to watching that evolution. My follow-up is about this ACATS-In launch. I'm just curious. As that comes to market would you expect that to be a friction point that you're removing more so with new customers? Is it going to be an AUC driver for existing customers? Just curious how that could potentially impact the model as it's launched?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes for sure. I'll field that question. So, we actually had ACATS-In on the platform several years ago prior to bringing our own clearing system in-house. And what we saw during that period was net incoming ACATS so more people were transferring ACATS in than transferring out to other brokerages. And a large portion of that was customers enjoy the Robinhood product and find value in consolidating their stocks and various assets in one place. So the -- we do think that that's something we hear from customers. All things being equal, they'd like the opportunity to consolidate. And we do think that's going to be largely customers that already have accounts. So, we think existing customers consolidating more and more of their activity on Robinhood is a behavior that we believe is out there and we can help satisfy. \nOperator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nSteven Chubak: Hi good evening. So I wanted to just touch on some of the new product launches and one that I really didn't get much airplay on the call is fully paid sec lending. I was hoping you can give us an update on how that launch is progressing and whether you could frame or provide some context on how we should be thinking about that incremental revenue opportunity? \nJason Warnick: Yes. Thanks for the question. It's Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. So, as you know we have margin-based sec lending today. Really proud of the trading desk and the skill set that we have there around securities lending. On fully paid securities lending a couple of things that I'd say. One reason we're really excited about that is, it's an opportunity to enable customers to achieve more yield on their portfolios by participating in the program. And this is another kind of example in the financial system where it's typically limited for folks with larger account balances. So we're excited to bring this to more and more people. Over the last year there's been some structural changes on the regulatory front, in terms of the requirements for the program. And so we've been working close with the teams and with the regulators to make sure that we build against those requirements and roll out a product that meets all of those. And this is a program that actually requires FINRA approval. And so we're working with them. We've got a good productive and open dialogue with them. But we're excited to roll this out when we get the approval and we finish building. So hard to predict the timing, particularly because of the approval but I would say that the teams are getting really close to being ready to roll this out. We think it's a meaningful opportunity not just for customers but also for us. And it has the potential to be kind of hundreds of millions in annual revenue for us. So we'll have to stay tuned. And again, we think it's just great for customers so eager to get this launched.\nSteven Chubak: Helpful color, Jason. Thanks for taking my question.\nJason Warnick: Yes, you bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Bolu of Autonomous. Your line is open.\nChristian Bolu: Good evening. Just back to crypto and to Vlad's point earlier around being early in the product life cycle. Can you help us understand your monetization road map on crypto over the next two to three years? What is your ballpark take rate on crypto today relative to folks like Coinbase that are about 140 basis points? And then as you add more products like the wallet, more coin, staking, et cetera, how do you see that take rate trending over time?\nJason Warnick: Yes. Thanks Christian for the question. So it's Jason. I'll take it and Vlad might have some additional color. So we're incredibly optimistic about crypto. We're hearing from customers that they want more coins. They want the ability to earn interest through either lending or staking. As we commented earlier, we're being very mindful and diligent in this space. It's evolving from a regulatory perspective. There's been a number of questions raised about coins on other platforms being potentially unregistered securities. And so we think it's the right thing not just for shareholders and for the company but also for customers to make sure that we apply the same kind of diligence to any new coins and new features including lending which has been suggested as an unregistered security that we make sure that we do the right thing for everyone involved, all stakeholders involved before we roll something like that out. And so you're generally not going to see us to be the first mover, particularly in this regulatory environment until we get a bit more clarity. But we do hear our customers and they want more features. And so we're going to be working as fast as we can with the right balance of safety and compliance to make sure that we don't make missteps here. This is something that we've learned over time. And we've built the competency in-house to be diligent and we're going to take advantage of that. And I do think that the safety first focus that the company has is really a differentiator for us and a competitive advantage. So super happy about that. In terms of the take rate, we earn revenue on crypto through rebates on the market making similar to how it works in the brokerage space and the amounts that you heard on fraction of what customers are paying at other cryptocurrency marketplaces.\nChristian Bolu: Okay. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, can you talk about how you think about acquisitions going forward? I mean it's very clear that you potentially have a significant ARPU opportunity if you indeed become the premier money app. You do have a rich currency, despite what's happening in the aftermarket today. So can you talk about how you're thinking about maybe using M&A and acquisitions to reaccelerate your strategic objectives?\nJason Warnick: Yes, you bet. We've built a solid team in corp dev. Historically, we've done the majority of our growth -- vast majority of our growth through organic. We continue to be kind of a build-first mindset. That said, I do think that it makes sense for us in the area of fintech to be paying close attention to how we might be able to accelerate our road map beyond organic growth. And so I don't have anything to announce today, but we do have the competency in in-house. And I think that, we've built up the leadership team to be able to handle acquisitions going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to try to get a little bit more color on the plan to launch retirement accounts, I know the timing is uncertain right now. But just trying to get a sense, if that's something that might be coming within the next year or it's a little bit longer than that? And then linking that with the ACATS-In, is that something that you would plan on having that ability for customers to then ACATS-In say your retirement account from another institution in that and looking at that as a lever of organic growth?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I'll be happy to field that. So certainly, it is on next year's product road map, and we would be looking to leverage our ACATS-In functionality across all accounts. We're building things in a way that they can leverage common infrastructure and they're interoperable. So certainly, we'd be looking to allow ACATS-In for all account types that we support including IRAs.\nBrian Bedell: And ACATS-In would be before retirement accounts I would assume?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. Very likely so, yes.\nBrian Bedell: Great.\nVlad Tenev: Well ACATS-In is sort of a nearer-term one; whereas retirement accounts medium to long term.\nBrian Bedell: Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, just on the customer, the 24/7 customer support, any early statistics on usage of that customer support? Maybe on wait times or how people are using \u2013 which areas they're using it for in terms of crypto versus stocks and options?\nJason Warnick: So we haven't provided any metrics here. What I'd tell you is that, when we survey our customers after using the phone support, the satisfaction rates are significantly higher than other methods of contacting us. And we have been very pleased to set aggressive internal SLAs, and we're doing very well against those SLAs. As you know, with over 22 million funded accounts, it's not just manpower, or a people power kind of challenge. It's also a technology challenge. And so together with phone support, it's providing workflows within the product itself to help customers answer their own questions. It's proactively finding reasons why customers need to contact us in the first place and rolling out improvements to the product. And so I think the combination of all of these things are adding to just improve sentiment about the product experience.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thank you very much.\nIrvin Sha: And with that, I think that we are roughly at time. I just want to quickly thank everyone for joining the call and your continued interest. And we look forward to talking to you guys again next quarter.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. Thank you for all the questions. And thank you for \u2013 to the Robinhood team for all the hard work they're putting in to build products and keep our service reliable for customers.\nJason Warnick: Yeah. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thanks Irv, and thank you all for joining. Let me first start by discussing growth. In Q3, net cumulative funded accounts were 22.4 million, up 97% year-over-year and slightly off versus Q2. As we previewed last quarter, in Q3, we saw considerably fewer new funded accounts and lower revenue as compared to Q2. In Q3, we added 660,000 new funded accounts bringing our total additions for the year to 11.4 million nearly doubling our customer base since the end of last year. It's been an incredible year and we are still very early in our journey of democratizing finance for all. Looking back at Q2, we saw a huge interest in crypto, especially Doge leading to large numbers of new customers joining the platform and record revenues. In Q3, crypto activity came off record highs leading to fewer new funded accounts and lower revenue as expected. Historically, our growth has come in waves. The surges have come during periods of increased volatility or market events. We've also seen that new customers join when we add new products and features giving us some degree of control over our growth. Going forward we expect to see these patterns persist. Jason will talk more about growth, our financials and our fourth quarter outlook in just a moment. For more than a year, we've devoted a significant majority of our resources to safety first initiatives, most notably platform stability and service reliability. We've seen massive increases in new customers and trading activity over the past year, and I believe we have never been in a better position to serve these new customers. We've also made huge strides in expanding our pool of top engineering talent. With the progress we've made on those two fronts, we think we now have much greater flexibility to allocate resources to new product development, and we're starting to see the results from that. As I did last time, I'd like to cover our progress, organized by our values. As a reminder, our top values are safety first, participation is power, radical customer focus and first principles thinking. Beginning with safety first. We've continued to make substantial progress on customer support and educational content. We want Robinhood to be the most trusted financial institution. This will take time, but we believe we are making good progress. For example, I'm incredibly proud that we successfully rolled out 24/7 live phone support in our app. Customers can request a call back at any time of the day for help on any topic. And I'm really excited to say that our support team also serves crypto, making us the first major crypto platform to provide 24/7 live phone support. We're also heavily leveraging proprietary technology to increase the efficiency of this service. Our interactive triage flow can pinpoint where support is needed, connecting customers with a representative who can provide a fast and personalized resolution. Our next step is to expand phone support to customers, who aren't in the app. We're working on this, and plan to roll it out in the coming months. We're also continuing to build educational content that helps new investors become long-term investors. Following last quarter's rollout of in-app educational modules, we've added more tools and features that help our customers better understand the market investing and our app, all in ways that are contextually relevant for them. For example, to help customers learn more about options, we will soon enable them to set-up hypothetical trades, and see how their trades perform over time. This gives customers a way to gain practical knowledge and confidence, before investing their money. We're also beginning to integrate Robinhood Snacks, our digestible financial news content directly into our app. Snacks is one of the most widely consumed financial newsletters with over 23 million unique readers in Q3. We're excited to deliver this content to more and more of our customers, to help them stay informed of the top financial news. Over time, we'll be finding more ways to integrate Snacks with Robinhood. We think there are a lot of exciting synergies here. And we've entered into our first big content distribution partnership making Robinhood Snacks available on Snapchat to their millions of users. Together, we have created one of the first finance education channels delivered on Snap's Discover tab. We're really excited to extend the reach of Robinhood Snacks and are pleased to be working with the team at Snap. Now, turning to participation is power. We have continued expanding access to financial markets for all our customers. Customers are really loving the ability to participate in IPOs through Robinhood. As of today, we've partnered with 12 companies across a wide range of industries that have made their IPOs available to Robinhood customers. Six of these companies have crossed 30 days since their listing on the platform, and we continue to see our customers holding over 80% of their allotted shares 30 days post-IPO. This gives us confidence that more and more issuers will view our platform as a great way to reach retail shareholders. In this quarter, we began integrating, Say events into our application, giving customers improved access to annual shareholder meetings, product launch events, and company Q&A forums. Just this month, for the first time Robinhood customers used Say to ask questions that were then answered live during an annual shareholder meeting. Going forward, we see an opportunity to continue building on this momentum to revolutionize the way retail shareholders connect with the companies they own. This is truly an exciting moment for retail investors.  On to radical customer focus, we've been ramping up the pace of product development this quarter. We've opened the wait list for crypto wallets. This has been one of the most requested features from our customers and we're excited that over one million customers have signed up to date. We're making our wallet features simple, and intuitive, and expect to begin introducing this to customers in the coming weeks. We also introduced recurring investments for crypto, which is a great way for customers to automatically build their positions over time, without having to stress about timing the market. And of course, we are very excited to offer our crypto customers 24/7 live phone support directly from the app. I should mention, we are keeping a close eye on crypto as the regulatory landscape is increasingly uncertain. We're aiming to deliver great new crypto features for customers, while being mindful of keeping our platform safe and introducing products that comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Crypto is still very early, and we're excited to be investing in our platform here. Looking ahead, I'd like to share a few upcoming products and features that we're excited about. Just last week, we started rolling out our new Recommendations engine, which will help the new customers select their first investment. This feature not only helps our customers get started, but also helps educate them on things like ETFs, and the importance of diversification. We're also getting very close to making it possible for customers to transfer existing investments from other brokerages into Robinhood. This is called ACATS-In. And until now, our ACATS functionality has only been available for outbound transfers. This will change that, and I'm eager to see this launch. And finally, before I turn this over to Jason, I'd like to highlight that as part of our new product road map, we're committed to delivering tax-advantaged accounts for retirement. We know this is important for our customers, and our teams are hard at work to make this a reality. We aren't ready yet to provide a time line, but we look forward to updating you on our progress. We're still very early in our journey. We're continuing to invest for the long term, and remain focused on our vision of building a single-money app for our customers. With that, let me turn it over to Jason to discuss our financial results. Of course. Yes, thank you for your questions. And we know that the community is really excited to see more features in our crypto offering. We hear this loud and clear. Our customers want new coins, the ability to deposit and withdraw, as well as ways to earn interest under crypto. And as we mentioned in the release, we're excited about crypto wallets. Over 1 million customers are on the wait-list for crypto wallets thus far and this is coming soon. So, on new coins specifically, one thing to mention is that crypto wallets will allow customers to participate and take coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that they purchased on Robinhood to participate in some of the other decentralized applications off-platform which allow access to coins that we don't offer. So, we actually believe that by rolling out wallets we will go a long way towards addressing the primary pain point that customers feel right now. One other thing that we're mindful of and I noticed this -- I mentioned this earlier in the release. The regulatory environment in terms of new coins and lending products in crypto is uncertain and evolving. And we're having to carefully evaluate whether we can add new coins in a way that's safe for customers and in line with regulatory requirements. So as you probably are aware the Securities and Exchange Commission other regulators have raised questions about whether lending and staking features are actually unregistered securities offerings, whether a lot of the coins at and tokens at other platforms are unregistered securities. And we feel very, very good about the coins that we're currently listing on our platform. And for any new coins that we add we want to feel equally if not more good. So we're going to be very careful. We're a regulated entity and we're hopeful to get some clarity soon on coins. So until then we'll continue to work with our regulators to hopefully land in a place where regulations allow for innovation and are applied evenly across the industry. The only other thing I'd mention is that we've been investing a lot in the crypto team. The team started out a year ago as a fairly small team. They've done a lot of great work scaling the platform. And they've rolled out a lot of really exciting features so not just the wallet wait list, but also recurring and 24/7 phone support. And we're excited to keep innovating in this space and there's much more to come here. Yes, I'll field this one too. Thank you, Tushar. So as we mentioned we are committed to support retirement accounts, IRAs specifically in the product road map. We don't have specific details on time line yet, but I will tell you it's very much in line with our mission. We want to see everybody being an investor and tax-advantaged accounts do a lot and are important for customers as a way to encourage long-term investing behavior. So it's something we're excited about. We know it's mission aligned and we can't wait to deliver a great product for our customers there. Yes. Thank you for this question. This is something we've heard a little bit. So we do offer some extended trading hours right now but are hearing from customers that they want those hours extended. So just some of the challenges in doing this: limited liquidity and wide spreads. So we want to make sure that we communicate to customers that conditions outside of normal trading hours may differ. And I think this is incredibly important, especially, given that many of our customers are investing for the first time. That said we do hear customers on this and I'm happy to say that teams are actively working on this. So you should be hearing more from us on this in the coming months. Well, thank you for the question. So this is one that we're excited to talk about. We've been making good progress on the wallets and we're going to be rolling out to the first set of external customers in the next few weeks. So one of the interesting things about this rollout getting to this point has taken a lot of great work from the teams. So we're using this as an opportunity to make an experience that's traditionally been very cumbersome and complicated and scary to some customers. Easy and intuitive while also introducing security hygiene in a way that's understandable. So we anticipate the first launch, the first set of external customers to get a high-quality product. But moreover we're excited to continue building this in public with the community. So even though we want to give people a high-quality product as the first set of customers, we'll take their feedback and report back to the community about what that feedback is and incorporate that into the product while it's rolling out. So we do think the product will continue to improve and we're excited to share the progress with the community. So we -- the aim is nothing short of rolling out the easiest to use, safest and most delightful wallet experience for our customers. So next few weeks first set of external customers; and we expect to have wallets available to all customers in Q1 of next year. Yeah. Thank you, Brandon. This is something that we hear from customers from time-to-time. We don't have anything to share about gifting stocks on the road map right now. But stay tuned and this is definitely something that we'll consider for the future. Yeah. I would just add, I think Jason really put it well. We think that Robinhood is very well positioned to create an ecosystem between shareholders and the companies that they're investing in. You see through participating in the IPOs, to investing post-IPO, to engaging with the management teams like on the Say platform, people are really becoming and behaving like owners in these enterprises. And we think that's a very positive thing for our economy, for these companies, and the broader landscape. So we're excited to invest more here. Good evening. Yes. I would just start, this is Vlad, by saying that, I think, we're still quite early in the crypto space and Robinhood sees a lot of opportunity ahead of us. So the wallets wait list where we're rolling that out, looking forward to getting that out to customers in the coming weeks. And I think that unlocks an entirely new segment of the crypto space for Robinhood and for our customers. They'll be able to send crypto off-platform and really get access to the broader ecosystem that way. Recurring crypto, we're very excited to see that come out. And that's been a requested feature and something that allows customers to dollar cost average into crypto and not be as concerned about price volatility. And 24/7 phone support for crypto, which is very unique in the space. So we're certainly a long way from being finished with the crypto road map. We're closer to the beginning. And we see a ton of opportunity ahead of us to continue to deliver value to customers. Yes. And I would just add to that that over the past 1.5 years through the pandemic and the first part of 2020, we've been a little bit on our back foot coping with the huge growth in new customers and trading revenue. And we've had to allocate significant resources towards scaling and improving operations and customer support. So, the benefit of slightly reduced volatility is that we have a lot more breathing room to work on new products and features for customers. And so we're excited to deliver those and we think that customers will really enjoy what we're coming out with. Thanks, Ken. In Q2, sure yes. Yes, there were millions of new funded accounts that came for cryptocurrencies, particularly dogecoin in Q2. So certainly, it was a meaningful portion of the new accounts in that period. Yeah. I'll be happy to field that. So certainly, it is on next year's product road map, and we would be looking to leverage our ACATS-In functionality across all accounts. We're building things in a way that they can leverage common infrastructure and they're interoperable. So certainly, we'd be looking to allow ACATS-In for all account types that we support including IRAs. Yes. Very likely so, yes. Well ACATS-In is sort of a nearer-term one; whereas retirement accounts medium to long term. Yeah. Thank you for all the questions. And thank you for \u2013 to the Robinhood team for all the hard work they're putting in to build products and keep our service reliable for customers."

            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks Vlad. In Q3, net cumulative funded accounts were 22.4 million, up 97% year-over-year and slightly down versus Q2. Monthly active users were 18.9 million up 76% year-over-year. And assets under custody were $95.4 billion, up 115% year-over-year. MAU and AUC each declined sequentially, off a record Q2. During the quarter, we added 660,000 new funded accounts bringing our total additions for the year to 11.4 million. Churn was 870,000 accounts, improving on a percentage basis versus the first two quarters of 2021. I'm happy to see churn come back more in line with what we were seeing in 2020. And offsetting churn 110,000 customers returned to Robinhood during the quarter. Also in Q3 customers contributed $2.3 billion in net deposits. Now let's turn to revenue. Total net revenues were $365 million in Q3, up 35% year-over-year but down sequentially, as expected. Looking at the components of revenue, transaction-based revenues were $267 million in Q3 which is down sequentially, but up 32% year-over-year. Equities revenue was $50 million down 27% year-over-year. Options revenue was $164 million up 29%. And crypto revenue was $51 million up 860% year-over-year. While crypto came off record highs from Q2, it significantly exceeded last year's Q3 level. Looking at trading activities, there are a few call-outs. Customers placing trades were up year-over-year, 24% for equities, 11% for options, and 287% for crypto. During the quarter, equities DARTs were down 4% year-over-year, option starts were flat and crypto DARTs were up 340%. Notional volumes traded per trader were down 39% for equities, and up 124% for crypto, while average options contracts per trader were up 18%. Moving to assets under custody, equities AUC was $69 billion up 83%. Options AUC was $1.4 billion up 4%, and crypto AUC increased to $22 billion versus $1.1 billion in the prior year. As a reminder, the crypto currency market is extremely volatile. And we anticipate these conditions are likely to persist. As for cash management the product continues to get traction reaching 5.5 million customers, up 293% year-over-year. 25% of our funded customer accounts now use our cash management product. And this is an area we are excited to keep investing in. Moving to net interest revenues, they were $63 million for the quarter up 26%. Primary components include securities lending which totaled $33 million up 20% year-over-year but down sequentially, margin interest which totaled $34 million in the quarter up 61% year-over-year and interest expense which was a $6 million offset to net interest revenues in Q3. Our margin book reached $6.1 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 168%. At the end of the quarter 256,000 customers held a margin balance representing about 1% of our net cumulative funded accounts. And for other revenues, they increased 101% to $34 million, driven largely by year-over-year growth in our gold subscriptions. Now for operating expenses, I'd like to remind you that beginning with our IPO, we are now recording share-based compensation from RSUs within each of our operating expense line items. In total, our share-based compensation for Q3, totaled $1.2 billion, which includes a cumulative charge totaling $1 billion recorded at the time of the IPO. It will make our year-over-year comparisons for OpEx a bit challenging, so I encourage you to check out the investor presentation for details on SBC included in each operating line. We continue to make progress building our teams with increases primarily in engineering, customer service, and our regulatory and compliance teams. In the quarter, we added 580 new full-time employees across the company growing 21% sequentially versus Q2. We made sequential progress reducing fraud losses down 23% versus Q2. We have more work to do here and this is constantly evolving but I'm proud of the progress our teams have made. Lastly the team is working diligently to improve our operating leverage and efficiency. This is a long-term cultural commitment for us and I'm confident we will deliver on this. Now, let's turn to measures of profitability. Net loss for Q3 was $1.32 billion, which includes the $1.2 billion in share-based compensation. This compares to a net loss of $11 million in the prior year quarter. And adjusted EBITDA was negative $84 million compared with positive $59 million in the prior year quarter. As a reminder adjusted EBITDA primarily excludes the impact of share-based comp. Now for Q4. We anticipate that total revenue will be less than $325 million and full year revenue will be less than $1.8 billion. At the top end this implies full year revenue growth of 85%. Additionally, we expect new funded accounts in Q4 will be roughly in line with Q3. As you know the market is uncertain and could be highly volatile. So, these comments are assuming a steady state for what we've seen so far in these first few weeks of the quarter and do not assume any changes to market volatility or incorporate any anticipation of exogenous events. As a reminder, our industry sees a typical seasonality curve that shows higher growth in the first quarter of the year versus the last three quarters. Additionally, we continue to monitor regulatory developments relating to market structure matters such as statements from the SEC on payment for order flow, cryptocurrency regulation, option trading due diligence, and digital engagement practices. We remain focused on the long term and we're very excited about our product roadmap. We are introducing the next generation to investing and all things money and we believe there's a big opportunity ahead of us. With that, Irv, let's turn to Q&A. Yes, happy to take this. What I'd tell you right now is that we're really focused on investing for the future. And so you see us investing heavily in our teams adding to the teams like engineering and customer support. And you're going to continue to see us investing for the future and not really focus on profitability at least in the near term. What I will say though is when I look at our operating structure I feel really good about our unit economics. I think we're set up to be a profitable company over the long-term, but right now that's just not our focus. In terms of competition what I'd tell you is that I think we're really well-positioned to keep building for customers. And that's going to be adding products and features that our customers love add values that are great for customers. And over time we think that that combined with our brand and our focus on safety first will help us be very competitive in the market. Yeah. So PFOF has been getting quite a bit of regulatory attention including specific comments from Chair Gensler talking about banning PFOF being on the table. I do think it's important to step back when thinking about PFOF to consider where we've come from. Robinhood led the way in commission free trading and that's led across the industry to save billions of dollars for investors. And millions of people are participating who previously weren't including just a much more inclusive and diverse population of investors. And so we really think that as this question of PFOF has looked at, we hope that as the SEC looks at the data that they'll see the benefits that PFOF has brought to the industry and to the millions of people who are now participating. Now in terms of the question, I do think that over time we're going to be rolling out more products and services. We talked a little bit about retirement accounts. We're investing in our cash management product and certainly crypto. And so we'll be diversifying our product selection over time. And I would say that there's also an opportunity for us to participate more in the market making of the order flow as I mentioned last quarter. So lots of opportunities for us over time, and on PFOF we're certainly paying close attention. Yeah. Thanks Devin and I appreciate the question. This is Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. The first comment that I'd make on the revenue guidance is that it's based on what we've seen for just a few short weeks at the beginning of the quarter. It's assuming that we don't see any changes in market volatility and no kind of exogenous events if you will in the market. And we wanted to be, what we felt was appropriately conservative for our revenue guidance, particularly in the fact that we are facing seasonal headwinds and lower year-over-year volatility. In terms of crypto, it's very difficult to predict, what we'll see. But what we did is incorporate what we've seen for the first couple of weeks of the quarter and incorporated that into the guidance. In terms of your question on marketing, I think that's a good one. When we look at marketing, particularly in environments where there is just generally lower volatility and less interest in investing, we've decided as a company to be cautious about chasing growth with marketing dollars. You can always spend more to get more customers, but what we've seen is you tend to get lower-intent customers at worse economics, in these periods where there's just lower volatility and less interest. And that said, I think the opposite is also true that in periods of higher volatility, and higher interest in trading, we tend to lean a little bit more into it. And of course, as you know, we've got a tremendous referral network. And we love the effectiveness of that. But, you should just expect as a management team, we're going to be cautious with the way that we approach our marketing dollars, so that the economics make sense as well as the customers who join us have high intent. Yeah. Thanks Devin. What I would say is it's still very early in the IPO Access product. What we've seen so far is incredibly encouraging. You heard the stats that Vlad had mentioned. As we've talked to potential issuers, particularly early on there was just a question of well how will Robinhood customers respond to receiving an allocation? Will they just quickly trade for a quick profit, or are they really in it for the longer term? And what we're seeing is that, our customers are holding on to the shares. And that's a really strong signal to issuers. And stepping back, just looking at the relationship between retail investors and the companies that they own, IPO Access is an important piece of that. I think the work that we're doing with Say, is also important. And what we're trying to do is, really revolutionize the way that investors are able to communicate with the companies that they own. And ultimately, be able to influence their policies and roadmaps and so on. So, really excited about the momentum there, our vision is that, the vast majority of IPOs should be made available to retail investors. And I think we're building a strong case that Robinhood should be the conduit for that. Hi Will. Yes. Will, when we kind of looked across the attrition that we've seen, not just in this period, but in prior periods, there really aren't any concentrations to call out. We feel great about the attrition rate, particularly as it's coming back down to more normalized levels. We did see higher attrition at the beginning of the year around some of the market events. But again, as we look at the cohorts and the demographics of the churning customers, we're not seeing any concentrations. And one thing that I'd really like to see is returning customers and having 110,000 customers come back to us this period was also really encouraging. We've seen that time and again that when customers have churned then we get a fairly good percentage of them coming back to us over time. And I think that the work that we're doing around safety first, certainly, all the improvements that we've made to our platform and site resiliency, but also the 24/7 phone support goes straight to customer trust. And we think that that over time is going to make a meaningful impact to churn. Yes. Thanks, Ken. Appreciate the questions. Similar to the -- my earlier comments on attrition, we're not seeing any concentrations, including at a product level, that would suggest that there's any specific source of concentration in the attrition that we're seeing. In terms of ACATS, we saw that come down over 30% versus the ACATS that we saw in Q2, so really good progress there. I think that's really owing to -- we had a volatile first half of the year, elevated attrition, elevated ACATS out. I think what we're seeing now is it's beginning to normalize. And I think that the efforts, that we're putting into safety first is certainly contributing to that normalization of departures. In terms of account growth, at a macro level what I would tell you is that, we don't expect our growth to be linear. And we certainly have seasonal headwinds right now. There's lower volatility by nearly 30% year-over-year. Both of those headwinds are absolutely contributing to what we're seeing. There's nothing else that I would point to. We look at our share of our new app downloads. That continues to be strong and we're taking an outsized share. So, what I'd tell you is that we expect kind of our growth not to be linear. It should ebb and flow with market conditions. The things that we can control are really new product launches and making sure customers have just a great experience when they're here. So, really continuing to be very optimistic. There's a long-term trend of increasing retail participation, and I think we're positioned really well to benefit from that. Happy to Rich. And as is pretty customary with IPOs, as we all know, we all have to deal with lockup releases and the implications to float. So just kind of at the highest level, we have about 68 million tradable shares that are out on the market today. Tomorrow on October 27, we have half of what we call Tranche I of the converts becoming unlocked as well as some shares from employees that unlock according to the lockup schedule. So that's 49 million shares relating to the shares received on Tranche I of the converts and another 13 million shares. That will be subject to trading windows of course relating to employees. So, roughly 62 million on tomorrow that will come out. So, 68 million right now, about 62 million coming out tomorrow. And then fast forward to November 10, and then the other 49 million, so the other half of Tranche I shares will begin be tradable. So that will be another 49 million. And then you move forward to December 1, and that's where all shares will be now fully tradable. You bet. Yes. Thanks for the question. It's Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. So, as you know we have margin-based sec lending today. Really proud of the trading desk and the skill set that we have there around securities lending. On fully paid securities lending a couple of things that I'd say. One reason we're really excited about that is, it's an opportunity to enable customers to achieve more yield on their portfolios by participating in the program. And this is another kind of example in the financial system where it's typically limited for folks with larger account balances. So we're excited to bring this to more and more people. Over the last year there's been some structural changes on the regulatory front, in terms of the requirements for the program. And so we've been working close with the teams and with the regulators to make sure that we build against those requirements and roll out a product that meets all of those. And this is a program that actually requires FINRA approval. And so we're working with them. We've got a good productive and open dialogue with them. But we're excited to roll this out when we get the approval and we finish building. So hard to predict the timing, particularly because of the approval but I would say that the teams are getting really close to being ready to roll this out. We think it's a meaningful opportunity not just for customers but also for us. And it has the potential to be kind of hundreds of millions in annual revenue for us. So we'll have to stay tuned. And again, we think it's just great for customers so eager to get this launched. Yes, you bet. Yes. Thanks Christian for the question. So it's Jason. I'll take it and Vlad might have some additional color. So we're incredibly optimistic about crypto. We're hearing from customers that they want more coins. They want the ability to earn interest through either lending or staking. As we commented earlier, we're being very mindful and diligent in this space. It's evolving from a regulatory perspective. There's been a number of questions raised about coins on other platforms being potentially unregistered securities. And so we think it's the right thing not just for shareholders and for the company but also for customers to make sure that we apply the same kind of diligence to any new coins and new features including lending which has been suggested as an unregistered security that we make sure that we do the right thing for everyone involved, all stakeholders involved before we roll something like that out. And so you're generally not going to see us to be the first mover, particularly in this regulatory environment until we get a bit more clarity. But we do hear our customers and they want more features. And so we're going to be working as fast as we can with the right balance of safety and compliance to make sure that we don't make missteps here. This is something that we've learned over time. And we've built the competency in-house to be diligent and we're going to take advantage of that. And I do think that the safety first focus that the company has is really a differentiator for us and a competitive advantage. So super happy about that. In terms of the take rate, we earn revenue on crypto through rebates on the market making similar to how it works in the brokerage space and the amounts that you heard on fraction of what customers are paying at other cryptocurrency marketplaces. Yes, you bet. We've built a solid team in corp dev. Historically, we've done the majority of our growth -- vast majority of our growth through organic. We continue to be kind of a build-first mindset. That said, I do think that it makes sense for us in the area of fintech to be paying close attention to how we might be able to accelerate our road map beyond organic growth. And so I don't have anything to announce today, but we do have the competency in in-house. And I think that, we've built up the leadership team to be able to handle acquisitions going forward. So we haven't provided any metrics here. What I'd tell you is that, when we survey our customers after using the phone support, the satisfaction rates are significantly higher than other methods of contacting us. And we have been very pleased to set aggressive internal SLAs, and we're doing very well against those SLAs. As you know, with over 22 million funded accounts, it's not just manpower, or a people power kind of challenge. It's also a technology challenge. And so together with phone support, it's providing workflows within the product itself to help customers answer their own questions. It's proactively finding reasons why customers need to contact us in the first place and rolling out improvements to the product. And so I think the combination of all of these things are adding to just improve sentiment about the product experience. Yeah. Thank you."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Head of Investor Relations and Capital Markets, Irvin Sha. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Sha: Thanks, Latif, and welcome everyone and thank you for joining us for Robinhood\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. With us today, our CEO and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev; and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation will contain forward-looking statements about Robinhood\u2019s expectations for the third quarter, as well as our strategic and operational plans. Actual results might differ materially from our expectations. Potential risk factors that could cause differences are described in the Form 10-Q we just filed with the SEC. All information on the call is as of today, August 18, 2021 and we undertake no duty to update it for subsequent events. Today\u2019s discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investors.robinhood.com. With that, let me turn over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you, Irv, and thank you to all of our listeners for joining Robinhood\u2019s first earnings call. Before sharing some of the highlights from Q2, I want to briefly introduce the company for those of you who are new to our story. We founded Robinhood on the belief that everyone should be welcome to participate in our financial system. The U.S. financial markets are one of the greatest sources of wealth creation in the world. However, access has been unevenly distributed with institutions and high net worth individuals enjoying better access and tools than others. We built Robinhood to fix that through a mobile-first product that removes the economic, educational and emotional barriers that have kept so many millions from participating. But our mission is bigger than investing. We want to become the most trusted and most culturally relevant money app worldwide. We believe we\u2019re already on the path and have many of the foundational elements in place, including a track record of attracting new customers to our platform, clear leadership in mobile, strong customer engagement and a vertically-integrated platform. For our quarterly updates, we\u2019re going to frame our progress through the lens of our four values. These values aren\u2019t just posters that we hang up on the wall in the office. We actually use them to allocate resources and to run our business. So in priority order, our first value is safety first. We\u2019ve been allocating the majority of our resources here. So let me go through some of the progress we\u2019ve made on safety first. Number one, stability and scale, have been the highest priority for our engineering team for well over a year. We\u2019ve continued to double down here. We\u2019ve added engineering talent and filled important senior leadership roles and we\u2019re methodically working to eliminate single points of failure, upgrade our systems and enhance the redundancy and resiliency of our services. I\u2019m especially pleased by the progress we\u2019ve made with our crypto services in Q2, making them more resilient to surges in trading volume. Number two, we\u2019re also investing heavily in customer support. In the second quarter of this year, we expanded live phone support to additional high-priority topics, and we\u2019re now serving customers on issues related to options trading, equities trading and account security. We\u2019re working towards being able to provide 24/7 phone support for substantially all of our customer contacts by the end of the year. We\u2019re also eliminating reasons customers contact us, and are applying technology to increase the quality and speed of our customer service responses. And we\u2019ve hired and trained hundreds of licensed representatives, doubling the size of our customer support team since the beginning of the year. We aren\u2019t done though. We want the quality of customer service at Robinhood to be a reason customers stay with us over the long run. And number three, we remain focused on building educational content that helps first-time investors become long-term investors. This quarter, we started to rollout our first set of educational modules in the app, which allow customers to take quick interactive courses on the basics of investing. We\u2019re continuing to build this out and look forward to introducing more advanced interactive learning tools in the coming months. So that\u2019s safety first, our top value. Let me talk a little bit about our second value, participation is power. So this is our oldest value as a company and it\u2019s focused on expanding access for customers worldwide. At Robinhood, everyone is treated equally, regardless of their income or wealth. And as we continue to build new products, you\u2019ll consistently see that at Robinhood, wealthier customers don\u2019t get a better deal. A great example of this is our new IPO Access product, which lets our customers invest in companies at their IPO price before trading on public exchanges, just as institutional and high net worth investors have been able to do for decades. We view this as another meaningful step towards increasing access to financial markets for every day investors. Six companies, excluding our own, have offered IPO shares to customers through IPO Access so far. We\u2019ve seen meaningful customer engagement on these deals with our share of the allocations oversubscribed by greater than 5x on all six deals. We\u2019re pleased to see that about 80% to 85% of the allotted shares to our customers were still held 30 days following the IPO for the two deals that priced in Q2. We\u2019re optimistic that more and more new issuers will view Robinhood as a way to better align themselves with their retail shareholders. We\u2019re also encouraged to see the response from customers to our Cash Management product, which grew to over 5 million customers at the end of Q2. So that\u2019s participation is power. Now for our third value, radical customer focus. So we exist to make our customers happy. We listen to customers. We innovate on their behalf to deliver more products and features that deepen our relationship with them. Our customers are showing a lot of interest in crypto. In fact, this is the first quarter where we saw a larger share of new customers place their first trade in crypto rather than in equities. And our customers are asking for more from us. We\u2019re investing heavily in our team. We\u2019re working on rolling out new crypto features such as more coins, recurring investments, the ability to deposit and withdraw your crypto. We\u2019re excited about the future of our crypto product. And now a bit on our final value, first principles thinking. So our foundation is in art, math and physics. We have a deep appreciation for breaking down complex problems and finding new ways to solve them. While we do pay close attention to what others have been doing, we strive to make bold bets that challenge the status quo regardless of how difficult the challenge is. We believe that over time, our first principles thinking will be a bigger and bigger differentiator for us. Now before I hand it off to Jason, I\u2019d like to take this moment to welcome the team at Say Technologies. We are thrilled to have Say join our team and excited by the possibilities of connecting Robinhood customers more deeply with the companies they invest in. With Say\u2019s Q&A technology, retail customers can engage with company management, ask questions and have their voices heard. And with Say\u2019s focus on proxy services, we think there is a really interesting opportunity for us to make it simple for retail investors to exercise their right to vote, truly empowering them like never before. With that, let me turn it over to Jason to discuss our second quarter financial results.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. I\u2019ll first talk about our Q2 performance and then provide some commentary on Q3. We had a strong growth in Q2 across our primary KPIs, driven by customer interest in crypto. In Q2, net cumulative funded accounts reached 22.5 million, up 130% year-over-year. Monthly active users reached 21.3 million, growing a 109% year-over-year, and assets under custody reached $102 billion, up 205% year-over-year. Increases in AUC since Q1 were seen across all three primary asset classes with crypto leading the way, up $11 billion; followed by equities, up $7.5 billion and options up $300 million. The growth was driven by $10 billion of customer net deposits during the quarter, as well as increases in the market value of underlying customer assets. Now let\u2019s turn to revenue. We achieved record total net revenues of $565 million in Q2, up 131% year-over-year. Transaction based revenues were $451 million in Q2, up 141% year-over-year, driven by the growth in our user base and strong interest in crypto during the quarter. In Q2, we saw the number of active crypto traders increased significantly versus the previous quarter. At the same time we saw decline in equity activity as our customers\u2019 interest rotated from equities to crypto. Crypto revenues increased to $233 million in Q2, up from just $5 million last year. Robinhood is now clearly on the map for crypto trading. Options increased to $165 million, up 48% year-over-year and equities were $52 million, down 26% year-over-year. For an overview of trading activity in Q2, equity DARTs were relatively flat year-over-year; 59% of funded accounts traded equities, which was down from 66% in the same quarter last year. DARTs for options were up 28% year-over-year; 5.6% of funded accounts traded options, which was down from 8.2% in the same quarter last year. And DARTs for crypto set a record at 63% of funded accounts traded crypto, up from 11% in the same quarter last year. Notably, 62% of crypto trading volume was in Dogecoin in Q2, which compares to 34% in Q1. Now over time, as our various products achieve maturity, you should see continued diversification and less reliance on any one revenue stream, such as payment for order flow. We are already seeing promising signs of this in Q2 with payment for order flow for equities and options as a percentage of our revenue declining to 38% from 64% in the prior quarter as customer interest in crypto increased. We expect the makeup of revenue to continue to fluctuate and payment for order flow in the near-term may again increase. But over the long run, the trend should be continued diversification as we add additional products. Now turning to net interest revenues, they grew 69% year-over-year to $68 million. Securities lending totaled $39 million, up 38% year-over-year, as we increased our securities lending balance, but experienced some softness in the average market rates we earned. Margin interest totaled $31 million in the quarter, up 185% year-over-year, as customers took advantage of our 2.5% APY on amounts borrowed over $1,000. Our margin book reached $5.4 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 303% year-over-year. Interest expense, which is related to our credit facilities and as an offset to net interest revenues, was $5.3 million in Q2. We significantly increased our ability to borrow for working capital and today have $2.8 billion in available funds through committed lines of credit. And other revenues increased 177% year-over-year to $46 million, driven by an increase in subscription revenue from Robinhood Gold and proxy-related revenues. Moving now to operating expenses, I have a few call outs. Brokerage and transaction expenses were $38 million, up 32% year-over-year, representing 7% of total net revenues. We saw some leverage in this line year-over-year, particularly from a reduction in the rate we\u2019re charged for certain clearing and regulatory related fees. Technology and development expenses were up 248% year-over-year to $156 million or 28% of total net revenues. Following high trading activity on our platform earlier this year and ahead of our IPO, we decided to procure additional cloud resources to help ensure site stability, particularly through June and July. Additionally, as we continue to invest in our development capabilities, we\u2019ve been aggressively hiring technology-related headcount, but over time we expect to see this line item decrease as a percentage of revenue. And for operations expenses, they were up 232% year-over-year to $101 million or 18% of total net revenues. We\u2019re increasing significantly, investing significantly in our customer support function, including rolling out live phone support and by increasing the number of dedicated customer support professionals. We are also incurring losses from debit card chargebacks and reversed deposit transactions. These costs totaled $40 million during Q2. We\u2019re focused on this and as you know, it\u2019s an industry-wide issue. We\u2019re using both technology and customer service to address this and we\u2019re looking forward to making some progress here. Stock-based compensation is included in each of our operating expense line items. As a reminder, prior to our IPO, we did not record any stock-based compensation on restricted stock units. In Q3, we will record a one-time cumulative charge of $1 billion in stock-based compensation for RSUs and begin recognizing RSU stock comp going forward. Now for measures of profitability, net loss for Q2 was $502 million compared to net income of $58 million in the prior year. Included in Q2 was a $528 charge related to the change in fair value of our convertible notes and related warrant liability. We will record a final charge of approximately $25 million for these notes and warrants in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA was $90 million in the quarter, up from $63 million in the prior year. Now let\u2019s turn to Q3. As a reminder, our business is subject to seasonality, which generally shows strong growth numbers in Q1 and into Q2, and less so in the back half of the year. We have experienced volatility from period to period that makes it difficult to accurately predict results in the short-term, and so we\u2019ll not be providing forward-looking guidance for key operating or financial measures. That said, we\u2019ll provide some commentary on what we\u2019re seeing in the first several weeks of the quarter that\u2019s underway. And for Q3, we expect seasonal headwinds and lower trading activity across the industry to result in lower revenues and considerably fewer new funded accounts than we saw in Q2. We\u2019re focused on the long-term and we\u2019re very excited about our product roadmap. We are introducing the next generation to investing in all things money and we believe there is a big opportunity ahead of us. With that, let\u2019s turn it over to questions.\nA - Irvin Sha: So last week, we announced that we\u2019ll be using Say Technologies to enable all Robinhood shareholders to submit questions for our management team. As of yesterday, we had received over 1,300 questions from our shareholders. We\u2019ll start today\u2019s Q&A by answering the top questions by number of votes, although we\u2019ll pass over any questions that are already being addressed. After that, we\u2019ll turn to the live questions from the analyst community. First, will HOOD payout a dividend in the future?\nJason Warnick: I\u2019ll take that, Irv. Thanks for the question. At this point, we think the best use of our capital is deploying it in the business. We\u2019re very much in the growth stage. And so for now, we have no plans to issue any dividends.\nIrvin Sha: Great. Number two, is Robinhood getting a crypto wallet?\nVlad Tenev: I\u2019ll be happy to fill that question. And I know that there\u2019s been a ton of enthusiasm from the crypto community and the Dogecoin community in particular, on getting access to wallets and it\u2019s something that our teams are working on. So let me tell you a little bit about sort of why this is difficult and challenging. So this year, clearly, Robinhood has had explosive growth in crypto during Q1 and Q2. And we\u2019ve had to grow out the team, we made a lot of progress growing out the team and really hiring great talent onto crypto, and scaling our systems to make sure that we can handle the increased load. And we\u2019re very proud of the work that the team has done. Of course, offering crypto wallets and the ability to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies is tricky to do at scale, we want to make sure it\u2019s done correctly and properly. And we want to make sure that everything from a security and operations standpoint is as bulletproof as possible, because our top value is safety first. And we hold ourselves to a very high standard for that. So I think as with all these things, we want to make sure it\u2019s right, but we have made a lot of progress in the crypto team in the platform. And we\u2019re excited to roll this out for our customers. And we definitely hear you and it\u2019s a key priority for our teams at Robinhood as well.\nIrvin Sha: Thanks, Vlad. Number three, what are Robinhood\u2019s plans for IRA 401(k) and HSA accounts? Are any or all of them a possibility for the future? And if yes, how soon?\nVlad Tenev: I\u2019d say the top level, we want Robinhood to be the most trusted, most culturally relevant money app worldwide. For the investing business, the goal is really to take our first time investors and turn them into long-term investors onto the platform. You\u2019ve seen that with some of our recent product launches, like recurring investments in DRIP, which are built on top of our fractional shares infrastructure. So we\u2019re continuing to invest in the technology, the tools and the educational content to empower our first time investors and make them long-term investors. We\u2019re also looking at multiple account types. So giving people access to tax advantaged accounts like IRAs and Roth IRAs, as well as things like joint accounts and beneficiaries. And we see all of that in the future. And I think what you\u2019ll find from us is we\u2019re not going to use earnings as a mechanism to announce new products. We don\u2019t intend to do that, at least for the foreseeable future. But you\u2019re going to see a continued product development in this area. We\u2019ve been really proud of the work that we\u2019ve done scaling our product and engineering and operations teams, so multiple account types are certainly on our radar.\nIrvin Sha: Great. Number four, are there any plans to launch Robinhood in other countries? If yes, what is the timeline?\nVlad Tenev: So we\u2019ve said from the very beginning that we want Robinhood to be a global company. And we actually think that we have a lot of advantages in going global. I think the value proposition of offering the best customer experience and low costs to our customers resonate, perhaps even more strongly overseas than in the U.S. where people by and large have access to reasonable quality financial tools. So we think there\u2019s a great global opportunity for us and it\u2019s very mission aligned for us as well. So in the past 18 months or so, as we\u2019ve dealt with a global pandemic and the strains on our business from having to scale our business dramatically, we have been focused more on the domestic business, the U.S. opportunity over the global opportunity. That said, due to improvements in our infrastructure, our staffing and our ability to handle the scale that we\u2019ve seen, we feel well-positioned to turn some of our attention to international. So we do anticipate that we\u2019ll be able to focus a little bit more no specific dates and timeline at this point. But we do find a lot of excitement in the opportunity.\nIrvin Sha: Next question, as initial investors, can we get a Robinhood hat and hoody jacket?\nJason Warnick: I\u2019ll take this one Vlad. So love the enthusiasm for the brand. I know Robinhood employees get really excited about swag. We\u2019d love to find a way to get that in the hands of our customers. So I can\u2019t make a commitment right now. But I will say that we\u2019ll go look at this. I think it\u2019s a great idea to get our branded merchandise in the hands of our community.\nVlad Tenev: I agree. Yes.\nIrvin Sha: Thanks. How do you ensure HOOD\u2019s price is not manipulated on Robinhood?\nJason Warnick: I\u2019ll take this one as well. Like all brokerages, we monitor the trading activity on our platform. And when we see any potentially manipulative activity on any stock, we take action, primarily that includes sharing that information with regulators so that they can take it from there. So that\u2019s our commitment. And we\u2019ve got a strong team looking at this.\nIrvin Sha: What\u2019s next for Robinhood, if PFOF is or payment for order flow is regulated, what can you do?\nJason Warnick: So what I tell you is that payment for order flow is regulated already. It\u2019s been primarily focused on disclosures. And we do provide all the required disclosures and we do our best to explain how we make money and what payment for order flow is, it\u2019s often misunderstood, component of our business and so appreciate the question. What I tell you is that over the long-term, our attention is to be the single money app. That implies more products, more features and innovation as Vlad was talking about, not just on the existing products that we have, but certainly on new products. We want to be the single place that our customers go to for all things money. And that will lead to naturally to diversification in our revenue streams over time. Next?\nIrvin Sha: What are your plans to maximize shareholder value over the next year?\nJason Warnick: So I will tell you that, we tend as a management team to really focus on the long-term. And as I just mentioned, we want to be the single money app. And so that really is about rolling out new products and new features. That said in the short-term, we have a number of things that are on our roadmaps that we\u2019re going to deliver. We take a lot of cues from our customers and as Vlad mentioned earlier, they\u2019re asking for more functionality, more coins in the crypto space. I think there is opportunities to roll out products that will increase returns for customers as well as us through fully paid securities lending. And we\u2019re pretty excited about our cash management product. We announced that our cash management now has over 5 million customers. We think that\u2019s really interesting place for us to offer more value, get higher adoption and also generate more returns for shareholders, so a lot of opportunity in front of us.\nIrvin Sha: Great. Are we getting a feature where we can post comments and discuss more about the stock in the near future?\nVlad Tenev: Well, I\u2019ll take this one. I would say that through our acquisition of Say, we were excited to give retail customers the chance to interact closer with companies through this format as a great example. And we\u2019re interested in further exploring that I think that there\u2019s a lot of possibilities to connect Robinhood customers more deeply with companies that their shareholders in and with each other. And of course, we want to be careful and make sure that we do that safely for everyone. And but we do see opportunity there. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re very excited about joining forces with Say.\nIrvin Sha: I\u2019ve skipping over this one, has been answered. Is there a plan to allow users to gift stocks to one another?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. I\u2019ll take that one as well. So we really appreciate the enthusiasm for this. I think that, in general, we\u2019ll be looking at how to make our referrals program and system even better. A lot of our customers do find out about our product through other customers that are already using us. And so you should expect continued product innovation there. And this is gifting stocks is certainly something that we\u2019ve thought about and would continue to explore.\nIrvin Sha: I think we have time for just a few more questions and then we\u2019ll get to the analysts. So IPO access has been an exciting new feature and further differentiates Robinhood from other investing platforms. Does the company see IPO access as a substantial driver of revenue growth in the next few years? How many IPOs can users expect on Robinhood for the rest of calendar year 2021?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes, I think the way we thought about it is very much in line with our mission, Access to IPOs at the IPO price has been something that when offered to retail investors, typically has been reserved for high net worth individuals in the past. So we\u2019re really excited to see that product go live and get such a good reception from customers. And I think one of the other things that we\u2019re happy about, as Jason mentioned, is that customers that have been participating in these IPOs have been relatively diamond handed, so to speak. So they\u2019ve been holding on to these stocks for over 30 days and haven\u2019t been flipping them. So I think that addresses a misconception that a lot of folks have had about retail in IPOs. In general, the way we think about it with any feature, we\u2019re optimizing for happy customers, we want to deliver value to them. We didn\u2019t really roll out IPO Access with an eye to generate revenue growth in the immediate term. But we do expect it to be a growing business. And we do expect to deliver more IPOs that customers can have access to as it becomes clearer to companies and issuers that this is a valuable constituency and invaluable to them as well.\nIrvin Sha: Okay, maybe one last one. What are the future steps taken to make Robinhood a better app to \u2013 and compete in the market with other apps like Webull, Fidelity, et cetera?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes, absolutely. Product development has been something that Robinhood has been prioritizing. So over time, you\u2019ve seen over the past few years, we\u2019ve continued to listen to customers. We\u2019ve continued to take advantage of our unique user research and design teams to understand what customers want and what they could use. And you should see that continue and hopefully accelerate over time. So we\u2019ll look to continue delivering great value improving our existing products and services, and expanding our existing businesses to really become the most trusted and most culturally relevant money app worldwide. That\u2019s the goal.\nIrvin Sha: Great. Thanks for that guys. And with that, I will ask the operator to open up the line and remind the analysts on how to enter into the queue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your question, please.\nRoss Sandler: Hey, guys. Going back to the single money app comment, as we look outside of investment and brokerage, what do you see in terms of product roadmap and logical areas for Robinhood to explore? And if we look to the east, something like Ant Financial, which is kind of the gold standard for the single money app concept, took them about four years to get the majority of their users to adopt new services outside of the core holiday payment product. So how do you feel about attach rate as you go outside of brokerage? Thanks a lot.\nVladimir Tenev: Yes, thanks for the question. I think that\u2019s an important one. I\u2019ll share my thoughts. So as we think about offering new services to customers, generally, the way we prioritize is we want to optimize for product market fit. So we don\u2019t rely too much on sort of the innate ability to cross sell within our platform, we task our product teams with making sure that products independently achieved product market fit. And then aside from that, we look for daily habits, so things that customers use and engage with on a daily basis, because we think that if we \u2013 if customers trust us with their daily habits, then over time, they\u2019ll trust us with their sort of lower frequency, higher value transactions as well. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve started with investing and expanded beyond equities into options, and then with our cryptocurrency business. And that\u2019s also why we\u2019re interested in spending and paycheck direct deposit. So one of the things that we\u2019ve talked a little bit about is that our cash management product, which is our debit card and high yield savings grew to over 5 million customers at the end of Q2. So we\u2019re really encouraged by that adoption. And we\u2019re very, very excited to double down on that keep investing more, keep delivering more value to customers using those products and we see an opportunity to be a substantial player in that space. I mean, 5 million cash management subscribers in just a couple of years, since launch, I think is something to be proud of. And with cryptocurrency took a couple of years before that really started showing massive sort of impact on our business. And we have that long-term perspective with future product line setting. We\u2019re encouraged by what we see, but we also recognize it\u2019s a long-term business and we want to keep adding functionality and keep making our customers happy by improving the products and services over time.\nIrvin Sha: Thanks, Ross.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good evening. So I appreciate some of the earlier comments on payment for order flow, Jason, thinking through a number of different scenarios for PFOF. If the regulators do ultimately institute an outright ban is internalization of order flow a viable alternative. And under such a scenario, how much of the revenue hit? Could you offset from internalization? And is the path to buy versus building a market maker, which one makes the most sense in your mind?\nJason Warnick: Yes, thanks for the question. What I tell you in terms of like our capability, Robinhood has a history of doing challenging projects go itself clearing for an example was certainly a heavy lift. And something that the team successfully did, it helped us verticalize our platform, I think positions as well to grow incredibly fast over time, and really control our own destiny, more than if we just partnered with a third party. So I think we have the capability to do it. And certainly others in the industry do internalize or even market make as a way to monetize the flow. So I think it\u2019s a viable option for us. In terms of the economics, before I even go there, I\u2019d tell you that, our view internally is that we don\u2019t expect payment for order flow to be banned. That\u2019s just not what we think. We expect it to be an active dialogue. I think that the regulators are asking for a study to be done, and we\u2019ll definitely engage. What I tell you is that, with a little bit of context before Robinhood, small investors were paying commissions on top of payment for order flow. And it kept a lot of people out. And so never before has investing in this country been cheaper and I think you can see by the 22.5 million customers that we have, that breaking down that barrier of commissions has been just good. And so we\u2019ll be definitely defending our customers and making sure that we don\u2019t put up barriers that have been taken down and kept people out. In terms of internalization, I probably don\u2019t want to go too far in terms of the economics, we have looked at it, we do think, because payment for order flow is such a small revenue stream, it\u2019s about $0.02 to $0.025 per $100 traded, that it\u2019s not a terribly difficult revenue stream for us to replace. Thanks for your question. Buy versus build, I think, I don\u2019t want to go too far down on that. But I\u2019d tell you that, we\u2019ve got confidence in us to build it, but buying certainly is an option for us. And we would look at both in that scenario.\nSteven Chubak: Great. For my follow-up, I was hoping to just ask on the topic of graduation risk, you\u2019re certainly well positioned to capture the growing wealth of the millennial cohort. The ACATS data that you guys have provided. This suggests that the average account that\u2019s leaving is about four times larger than the typical Robinhood account. I was hoping you could maybe unpack the strategy to address graduation risk. Now, as your clients accumulate more wealth, where are the biggest pain points that you feel you really need to address to try to mitigate some of those pressures?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes, I can share some thoughts there. Thank you. I\u2019d say at a high level, we\u2019re actually really happy with the retention and engagement on our platform. We think we compare very favorably there. I think, looking at the ACATS channel in particular, one thing that a lot of people don\u2019t realize is that we only have ACATS out live to customers right now. So a lot of customers actually are expressing an interest in consolidating their accounts into Robinhood, through ACATS in. And that is something we\u2019re listening to. And we\u2019re very, very keen to provide through our self-clearing conversion, which we did back in 2018. We had to temporarily turn-off ACATS in functionality. So, a lot of brokers will say, oh, we never lose an ACATS to Robinhood. Well, part of the reason is because we don\u2019t actually support ACATS in right now. So ACATS is typically a channel where you will see higher assets than ACH. So, I think the sort of observation is more channel specific than customer specific. You do typically see larger account sizes with ACATS, and we do anticipate that this will change when we allow ACATS in to the platform.\nJason Warnick: In terms of the part of your question about graduation risk, what I would tell you is that we fully intend to grow with our customers, you see that in our product roadmap. As we talked about wanting new investors to become long-term investors that\u2019s really going to inspire the products that we\u2019ve allowed and account pieces that we roll out, so that we don\u2019t see that. And then what I would tell you is, when we look at churn, we\u2019re not seeing any kind of customer demographic concentration that will be a concern.\nSteven Chubak: That\u2019s right. Thank you so much for taking my questions.\nJason Warnick: Yes, you bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your question please.\nJosh Beck: Thank you, team for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the new cohort that you brought in 2Q. Jason, I think you had commented a bit and that as well about the propensity to invest in crypto. So certainly that was notable. Are there any other maybe compare contrasts that you would do with prior new cohorts that you felt was notable?\nJason Warnick: Yes, what I would say is, in Q2, certainly a large cohort came in about 4.5 million net funded accounts in the quarter, which was near a record, Q1 was slightly higher. So this was the first time that we\u2019ve seen more first trades in crypto versus equities. And we love the momentum of our cryptocurrency business with over 60% of our customers overall trading during the period. What I\u2019d tell you on cohorts, it\u2019s a bit early to look at the newer cohorts and project out. But when we look at cohorts over time, I think you\u2019ve heard us say that they tend to start small, they\u2019re highly engaged, they grow with us both in terms of the revenue that they generate for us, as well as the net deposits that they put on the platform. And so far, there\u2019s nothing to suggest that that won\u2019t continue.\nJosh Beck: Very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up. What has the channel composition of referral and marketing spend looked like in Q2? And how are you thinking about that for the rest of the year?\nJason Warnick: Yes. So, as you know, kind of historically, we\u2019ve seen the majority of our customers coming to us, either organically or through our customer referral channel, we saw similar rates by channel in Q2. Looking forward, we expect to continue to have a robust customer referral platform. We are investing in more broad scale brand advertising to get our message out to customers. And so you should expect to see us to continue to invest in those kinds of messaging. But structurally, we\u2019ve been very efficient in the way that we acquire our customers, and we expect to be diligent going forward as well.\nJosh Beck: Thanks so much.\nJason Warnick: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Horgan of Rosenblatt. Your line is open.\nSean Horgan: Hey, thanks for taking my question. First one is on cash management. I wanted to get a sense for your monetization strategy, longer term. And more specifically, do you have any aspirations to offer things like interest earning crypto accounts or crypto rewards to retain users and drive inflows on your platform?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes, I can feel the second one. So certainly, we see a lot of enthusiasm from our crypto community. I think the newer term kind of foundational feature that we\u2019ll be looking to roll out will be wallets or deposit and withdrawal functionality. We\u2019ve also heard a lot of excitement and enthusiasm for increasing the listings that we have on our platform, so adding more coins, that\u2019s something we\u2019re looking to. And crypto interest and rewards are something that we\u2019re hearing as well. So, crypto started off 2021 as a very small team. The team has been growing, it\u2019s really become a great center of excellence for engineering and product within the company. We\u2019re proud of the work there. And I think we\u2019re excited to build for customers. I think there was a question as well, that you asked about cash management, monetization? Maybe, maybe, Jason\u2026\nJason Warnick: Yes, what I would tell you, Sean, is that our intention is to pass a ton of value back to customers who are participating with our debit card and cash management product. We\u2019re excited about rewards and incentives. And today we pass along the majority of the interest that we earn to customers, certainly at the low interest rate environment becomes interesting. I think over time as the interest rate environment will fluctuate. But we want our customers to look to Robinhood\u2019s debit card as their primary form of payment. And we think that that\u2019s a really interesting monetization opportunity for us over time.\nSean Horgan: Great, that\u2019s really helpful, guys. Thanks. And then just another follow-up, I guess on crypto, it\u2019s obviously grown very rapidly. And so I want to get a sense for market share trends and the competitive landscape. Vlad, I think you mentioned, listings as being an area of interest for customers. So, whether it\u2019s speed to the listing, new in demand assets, or pricing, just want to get a sense for what makes a user choose Robinhood over a different platform?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes, I think that this year, in particular, I think customers have really started to appreciate the two key value propositions behind crypto, which are the fact that it\u2019s a low cost offering. We\u2019re very proud of the pricing and the costs that we offer to customers, and especially relative to our competitors, some companies are charging multiple percents transaction fees and commissions. And Robinhood has been commission-free and we\u2019re proud of the deal that we offer and customers choose us for that. And also the fact that it\u2019s accessible that, everything is in one place with securities, with cash management and with crypto. And that it\u2019s easy to understand and it meets customers where they are, I think has continued to be an attractive aspect of our offering. And I think we, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be looking to continue as we build out more functionality, add new coins and give people the ability to move their coins on to an off the platform.\nSean Horgan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nIrvin Sha: I think \u2013 we have two more questions.\nOperator: Excellent. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citi. Your line is open.\nJason Bazinet: Thanks. I just had a question about your accounts. If you took your current account base, 22 million, and said a certain percentage have never had a brokerage account anywhere else, based on whatever that number is how deeply penetrated? Do you think you are in that segment of the market? Before you sort of run out of growth and have to start stealing accounts from someone that hasn\u2019t \u2013 a competitor? Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: Yes, thanks, Jason. I think what you\u2019re referring to is that our customers tell us, when they join about 50% of the time, they tell us that they\u2019re new to investing that this is their first brokerage account, I think that\u2019s really speaking kind of directly to our mission, to provide access, to the financial system. And we\u2019re really, really proud of that, by definition, the other half have brokerage accounts elsewhere. And so I really think this speaks to an opportunity for us to continue to, reach out to people who don\u2019t have investing accounts, we think there\u2019s no reason why anyone shouldn\u2019t be an investor investing is literally for everybody. And so that, in terms of the way we think about it, globally, anyone with a checking account, possibly with crypto where you don\u2019t even need a checking account, we think is part of the addressable market for us. And then, as we continue to roll out products and features to grow with our customers, I think more and more, you\u2019re going to see Robinhood, particularly with our mobile first platform and ease of use, be become incredibly attractive to folks that haven\u2019t previously considered Robinhood is the go to place. So we\u2019re pretty optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us. And that\u2019s, limiting the response to investing. I think there\u2019s a lot more that we can do, when we talk about being the single money app for our customers.\nJason Warnick: Yes, I would also say that, according to some recent research, about 60% of Americans don\u2019t have investments outside of retirement, and a greater percentage of 18- to 29-year-old 68% have no money invested all together. So well even though we\u2019ve made progress. I think there\u2019s a lot to do to encourage greater participation in the markets.\nJason Bazinet: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolf Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, thank you so much for accommodating the follow up. I just had one question on some of the 3Q outlook commentary. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, activity levels and account growths are moderating. I know you attributed that to seasonality, some of your peers and the volume data that we\u2019re tracking suggests that particularly among some of the crypto coins like Dogecoin, we\u2019re seeing a more pronounced decline. And I was hoping you could just \u2013 contextualize just in terms of orders of magnitude. How pronounced of a slowdown you\u2019re seeing in 3Q, just to help frame just overall activity levels you\u2019re seeing within the Robinhood ecosystem.\nVlad Tenev: Yes, thanks for your question, what I saw you highlighted seasonality for brokerages traditionally, the first quarter and into the second quarter tend to be the highest, activity quarters in terms of trading as well as new accounts, with the back half of the year being less. So, Robinhood is becoming a bigger portion of the overall market. And so seasonality is something that, we pay attention to. The other thing that we benefit from over time is volatility. And, there\u2019s been several moments of pretty notable volatility in the markets, not just in equities, which is mostly in Q1 but also with crypto, which is in Q2, makes it incredibly difficult to predict when those moments will continue, or happen again. But when they do happen, Robinhood tends to have an outsize benefit from that a really strong tailwind. And because of that, we\u2019re not really predicting, short-term results, we\u2019re more focused on kind of the long-term opportunity. And there we have some pretty dramatic and helpful tailwind for us. I think crypto as you saw in Q2 is becoming incredibly more mainstream and accepted in a way that didn\u2019t previously exist. Even a year ago, if you go back one year, we had $5 million in revenue from crypto very, very small. This year, it\u2019s 45 times higher than that, it really put Robinhood on the map for crypto, and in terms of trading levels overall, I would just point you to kind of the external market factors, it\u2019ll give you a pretty strong indication of how we\u2019re doing so far. But we think it\u2019s appropriate to provide the commentary about Q3 and we\u2019ll continue to deliver on products for customers.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks so much. And were just one final one for me just on a longer term opportunity. You alluded to your interest in expanding internationally; I was hoping you could unpack what the potential strategy could be to expand abroad. Maybe what gives you confidence you can scale given a number of U.S. brokerages over the years have certainly tried and failed to expand abroad. And PFOF, your primary source of revenue is also banned in a number of international jurisdictions.\nJason Warnick: Yes, what I would tell you and I sure, I\u2019m sure Vlad has some comments here is, we\u2019ve done a lot of work over the last year to, year and a half, expanding the platform here domestically, we\u2019re in a position to look at each international market, kind of uniquely based on the assets that we have, today we\u2019ve got a very strong crypto business, we certainly have an investing business. And we also have a, growing cash management business. And so there\u2019s a variety of ways that we can approach each international market depending on the circumstances there. In terms of whether or not payment for order flow is accepted, it\u2019s not something that we look at as a terribly high barrier for us for investing product internationally, we think, generally speaking, and certainly there\u2019s a distinction from geography-to-geography, there\u2019s a lot of interest in investing, particularly in U.S. companies. And there\u2019s opportunities, whether it\u2019s internalization, as was mentioned earlier Forex fees, there\u2019s just a number of ways that we could look at monetizing those businesses in the absence of payment for order flow.\nSteven Chubak: That\u2019s great color. Thanks for accommodating the additional questions.\nJason Warnick: Yes, of course.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you.\nOperator:\nIrvin Sha: All right. Thank you everyone, for taking the time for the call today. And we look forward to catching on the next one.\nVlad Tenev: Appreciate the questions. Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Yes, very much. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thank you, Irv, and thank you to all of our listeners for joining Robinhood's first earnings call. Before sharing some of the highlights from Q2, I want to briefly introduce the company for those of you who are new to our story. We founded Robinhood on the belief that everyone should be welcome to participate in our financial system. The U.S. financial markets are one of the greatest sources of wealth creation in the world. However, access has been unevenly distributed with institutions and high net worth individuals enjoying better access and tools than others. We built Robinhood to fix that through a mobile-first product that removes the economic, educational and emotional barriers that have kept so many millions from participating. But our mission is bigger than investing. We want to become the most trusted and most culturally relevant money app worldwide. We believe we're already on the path and have many of the foundational elements in place, including a track record of attracting new customers to our platform, clear leadership in mobile, strong customer engagement and a vertically-integrated platform. For our quarterly updates, we're going to frame our progress through the lens of our four values. These values aren't just posters that we hang up on the wall in the office. We actually use them to allocate resources and to run our business. So in priority order, our first value is safety first. We've been allocating the majority of our resources here. So let me go through some of the progress we've made on safety first. Number one, stability and scale, have been the highest priority for our engineering team for well over a year. We've continued to double down here. We've added engineering talent and filled important senior leadership roles and we're methodically working to eliminate single points of failure, upgrade our systems and enhance the redundancy and resiliency of our services. I'm especially pleased by the progress we've made with our crypto services in Q2, making them more resilient to surges in trading volume. Number two, we're also investing heavily in customer support. In the second quarter of this year, we expanded live phone support to additional high-priority topics, and we're now serving customers on issues related to options trading, equities trading and account security. We're working towards being able to provide 24/7 phone support for substantially all of our customer contacts by the end of the year. We're also eliminating reasons customers contact us, and are applying technology to increase the quality and speed of our customer service responses. And we've hired and trained hundreds of licensed representatives, doubling the size of our customer support team since the beginning of the year. We aren't done though. We want the quality of customer service at Robinhood to be a reason customers stay with us over the long run. And number three, we remain focused on building educational content that helps first-time investors become long-term investors. This quarter, we started to rollout our first set of educational modules in the app, which allow customers to take quick interactive courses on the basics of investing. We're continuing to build this out and look forward to introducing more advanced interactive learning tools in the coming months. So that's safety first, our top value. Let me talk a little bit about our second value, participation is power. So this is our oldest value as a company and it's focused on expanding access for customers worldwide. At Robinhood, everyone is treated equally, regardless of their income or wealth. And as we continue to build new products, you'll consistently see that at Robinhood, wealthier customers don't get a better deal. A great example of this is our new IPO Access product, which lets our customers invest in companies at their IPO price before trading on public exchanges, just as institutional and high net worth investors have been able to do for decades. We view this as another meaningful step towards increasing access to financial markets for every day investors. Six companies, excluding our own, have offered IPO shares to customers through IPO Access so far. We've seen meaningful customer engagement on these deals with our share of the allocations oversubscribed by greater than 5x on all six deals. We're pleased to see that about 80% to 85% of the allotted shares to our customers were still held 30 days following the IPO for the two deals that priced in Q2. We're optimistic that more and more new issuers will view Robinhood as a way to better align themselves with their retail shareholders. We're also encouraged to see the response from customers to our Cash Management product, which grew to over 5 million customers at the end of Q2. So that's participation is power. Now for our third value, radical customer focus. So we exist to make our customers happy. We listen to customers. We innovate on their behalf to deliver more products and features that deepen our relationship with them. Our customers are showing a lot of interest in crypto. In fact, this is the first quarter where we saw a larger share of new customers place their first trade in crypto rather than in equities. And our customers are asking for more from us. We're investing heavily in our team. We're working on rolling out new crypto features such as more coins, recurring investments, the ability to deposit and withdraw your crypto. We're excited about the future of our crypto product. And now a bit on our final value, first principles thinking. So our foundation is in art, math and physics. We have a deep appreciation for breaking down complex problems and finding new ways to solve them. While we do pay close attention to what others have been doing, we strive to make bold bets that challenge the status quo regardless of how difficult the challenge is. We believe that over time, our first principles thinking will be a bigger and bigger differentiator for us. Now before I hand it off to Jason, I'd like to take this moment to welcome the team at Say Technologies. We are thrilled to have Say join our team and excited by the possibilities of connecting Robinhood customers more deeply with the companies they invest in. With Say's Q&A technology, retail customers can engage with company management, ask questions and have their voices heard. And with Say's focus on proxy services, we think there is a really interesting opportunity for us to make it simple for retail investors to exercise their right to vote, truly empowering them like never before. With that, let me turn it over to Jason to discuss our second quarter financial results. I'll be happy to fill that question. And I know that there's been a ton of enthusiasm from the crypto community and the Dogecoin community in particular, on getting access to wallets and it's something that our teams are working on. So let me tell you a little bit about sort of why this is difficult and challenging. So this year, clearly, Robinhood has had explosive growth in crypto during Q1 and Q2. And we've had to grow out the team, we made a lot of progress growing out the team and really hiring great talent onto crypto, and scaling our systems to make sure that we can handle the increased load. And we're very proud of the work that the team has done. Of course, offering crypto wallets and the ability to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies is tricky to do at scale, we want to make sure it's done correctly and properly. And we want to make sure that everything from a security and operations standpoint is as bulletproof as possible, because our top value is safety first. And we hold ourselves to a very high standard for that. So I think as with all these things, we want to make sure it's right, but we have made a lot of progress in the crypto team in the platform. And we're excited to roll this out for our customers. And we definitely hear you and it's a key priority for our teams at Robinhood as well. I'd say the top level, we want Robinhood to be the most trusted, most culturally relevant money app worldwide. For the investing business, the goal is really to take our first time investors and turn them into long-term investors onto the platform. You've seen that with some of our recent product launches, like recurring investments in DRIP, which are built on top of our fractional shares infrastructure. So we're continuing to invest in the technology, the tools and the educational content to empower our first time investors and make them long-term investors. We're also looking at multiple account types. So giving people access to tax advantaged accounts like IRAs and Roth IRAs, as well as things like joint accounts and beneficiaries. And we see all of that in the future. And I think what you'll find from us is we're not going to use earnings as a mechanism to announce new products. We don't intend to do that, at least for the foreseeable future. But you're going to see a continued product development in this area. We've been really proud of the work that we've done scaling our product and engineering and operations teams, so multiple account types are certainly on our radar. So we've said from the very beginning that we want Robinhood to be a global company. And we actually think that we have a lot of advantages in going global. I think the value proposition of offering the best customer experience and low costs to our customers resonate, perhaps even more strongly overseas than in the U.S. where people by and large have access to reasonable quality financial tools. So we think there's a great global opportunity for us and it's very mission aligned for us as well. So in the past 18 months or so, as we've dealt with a global pandemic and the strains on our business from having to scale our business dramatically, we have been focused more on the domestic business, the U.S. opportunity over the global opportunity. That said, due to improvements in our infrastructure, our staffing and our ability to handle the scale that we've seen, we feel well-positioned to turn some of our attention to international. So we do anticipate that we'll be able to focus a little bit more no specific dates and timeline at this point. But we do find a lot of excitement in the opportunity. I agree. Yes. Well, I'll take this one. I would say that through our acquisition of Say, we were excited to give retail customers the chance to interact closer with companies through this format as a great example. And we're interested in further exploring that I think that there's a lot of possibilities to connect Robinhood customers more deeply with companies that their shareholders in and with each other. And of course, we want to be careful and make sure that we do that safely for everyone. And but we do see opportunity there. And that's why we're very excited about joining forces with Say. Yes. I'll take that one as well. So we really appreciate the enthusiasm for this. I think that, in general, we'll be looking at how to make our referrals program and system even better. A lot of our customers do find out about our product through other customers that are already using us. And so you should expect continued product innovation there. And this is gifting stocks is certainly something that we've thought about and would continue to explore. Yes, thanks, Jason. I think what you're referring to is that our customers tell us, when they join about 50% of the time, they tell us that they're new to investing that this is their first brokerage account, I think that's really speaking kind of directly to our mission, to provide access, to the financial system. And we're really, really proud of that, by definition, the other half have brokerage accounts elsewhere. And so I really think this speaks to an opportunity for us to continue to, reach out to people who don't have investing accounts, we think there's no reason why anyone shouldn't be an investor investing is literally for everybody. And so that, in terms of the way we think about it, globally, anyone with a checking account, possibly with crypto where you don't even need a checking account, we think is part of the addressable market for us. And then, as we continue to roll out products and features to grow with our customers, I think more and more, you're going to see Robinhood, particularly with our mobile first platform and ease of use, be become incredibly attractive to folks that haven't previously considered Robinhood is the go to place. So we're pretty optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us. And that's, limiting the response to investing. I think there's a lot more that we can do, when we talk about being the single money app for our customers. Yes, thanks for your question, what I saw you highlighted seasonality for brokerages traditionally, the first quarter and into the second quarter tend to be the highest, activity quarters in terms of trading as well as new accounts, with the back half of the year being less. So, Robinhood is becoming a bigger portion of the overall market. And so seasonality is something that, we pay attention to. The other thing that we benefit from over time is volatility. And, there's been several moments of pretty notable volatility in the markets, not just in equities, which is mostly in Q1 but also with crypto, which is in Q2, makes it incredibly difficult to predict when those moments will continue, or happen again. But when they do happen, Robinhood tends to have an outsize benefit from that a really strong tailwind. And because of that, we're not really predicting, short-term results, we're more focused on kind of the long-term opportunity. And there we have some pretty dramatic and helpful tailwind for us. I think crypto as you saw in Q2 is becoming incredibly more mainstream and accepted in a way that didn't previously exist. Even a year ago, if you go back one year, we had $5 million in revenue from crypto very, very small. This year, it's 45 times higher than that, it really put Robinhood on the map for crypto, and in terms of trading levels overall, I would just point you to kind of the external market factors, it'll give you a pretty strong indication of how we're doing so far. But we think it's appropriate to provide the commentary about Q3 and we'll continue to deliver on products for customers. Thank you. Appreciate the questions. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Vlad. I'll first talk about our Q2 performance and then provide some commentary on Q3. We had a strong growth in Q2 across our primary KPIs, driven by customer interest in crypto. In Q2, net cumulative funded accounts reached 22.5 million, up 130% year-over-year. Monthly active users reached 21.3 million, growing a 109% year-over-year, and assets under custody reached $102 billion, up 205% year-over-year. Increases in AUC since Q1 were seen across all three primary asset classes with crypto leading the way, up $11 billion; followed by equities, up $7.5 billion and options up $300 million. The growth was driven by $10 billion of customer net deposits during the quarter, as well as increases in the market value of underlying customer assets. Now let's turn to revenue. We achieved record total net revenues of $565 million in Q2, up 131% year-over-year. Transaction based revenues were $451 million in Q2, up 141% year-over-year, driven by the growth in our user base and strong interest in crypto during the quarter. In Q2, we saw the number of active crypto traders increased significantly versus the previous quarter. At the same time we saw decline in equity activity as our customers' interest rotated from equities to crypto. Crypto revenues increased to $233 million in Q2, up from just $5 million last year. Robinhood is now clearly on the map for crypto trading. Options increased to $165 million, up 48% year-over-year and equities were $52 million, down 26% year-over-year. For an overview of trading activity in Q2, equity DARTs were relatively flat year-over-year; 59% of funded accounts traded equities, which was down from 66% in the same quarter last year. DARTs for options were up 28% year-over-year; 5.6% of funded accounts traded options, which was down from 8.2% in the same quarter last year. And DARTs for crypto set a record at 63% of funded accounts traded crypto, up from 11% in the same quarter last year. Notably, 62% of crypto trading volume was in Dogecoin in Q2, which compares to 34% in Q1. Now over time, as our various products achieve maturity, you should see continued diversification and less reliance on any one revenue stream, such as payment for order flow. We are already seeing promising signs of this in Q2 with payment for order flow for equities and options as a percentage of our revenue declining to 38% from 64% in the prior quarter as customer interest in crypto increased. We expect the makeup of revenue to continue to fluctuate and payment for order flow in the near-term may again increase. But over the long run, the trend should be continued diversification as we add additional products. Now turning to net interest revenues, they grew 69% year-over-year to $68 million. Securities lending totaled $39 million, up 38% year-over-year, as we increased our securities lending balance, but experienced some softness in the average market rates we earned. Margin interest totaled $31 million in the quarter, up 185% year-over-year, as customers took advantage of our 2.5% APY on amounts borrowed over $1,000. Our margin book reached $5.4 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 303% year-over-year. Interest expense, which is related to our credit facilities and as an offset to net interest revenues, was $5.3 million in Q2. We significantly increased our ability to borrow for working capital and today have $2.8 billion in available funds through committed lines of credit. And other revenues increased 177% year-over-year to $46 million, driven by an increase in subscription revenue from Robinhood Gold and proxy-related revenues. Moving now to operating expenses, I have a few call outs. Brokerage and transaction expenses were $38 million, up 32% year-over-year, representing 7% of total net revenues. We saw some leverage in this line year-over-year, particularly from a reduction in the rate we're charged for certain clearing and regulatory related fees. Technology and development expenses were up 248% year-over-year to $156 million or 28% of total net revenues. Following high trading activity on our platform earlier this year and ahead of our IPO, we decided to procure additional cloud resources to help ensure site stability, particularly through June and July. Additionally, as we continue to invest in our development capabilities, we've been aggressively hiring technology-related headcount, but over time we expect to see this line item decrease as a percentage of revenue. And for operations expenses, they were up 232% year-over-year to $101 million or 18% of total net revenues. We're increasing significantly, investing significantly in our customer support function, including rolling out live phone support and by increasing the number of dedicated customer support professionals. We are also incurring losses from debit card chargebacks and reversed deposit transactions. These costs totaled $40 million during Q2. We're focused on this and as you know, it's an industry-wide issue. We're using both technology and customer service to address this and we're looking forward to making some progress here. Stock-based compensation is included in each of our operating expense line items. As a reminder, prior to our IPO, we did not record any stock-based compensation on restricted stock units. In Q3, we will record a one-time cumulative charge of $1 billion in stock-based compensation for RSUs and begin recognizing RSU stock comp going forward. Now for measures of profitability, net loss for Q2 was $502 million compared to net income of $58 million in the prior year. Included in Q2 was a $528 charge related to the change in fair value of our convertible notes and related warrant liability. We will record a final charge of approximately $25 million for these notes and warrants in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA was $90 million in the quarter, up from $63 million in the prior year. Now let's turn to Q3. As a reminder, our business is subject to seasonality, which generally shows strong growth numbers in Q1 and into Q2, and less so in the back half of the year. We have experienced volatility from period to period that makes it difficult to accurately predict results in the short-term, and so we'll not be providing forward-looking guidance for key operating or financial measures. That said, we'll provide some commentary on what we're seeing in the first several weeks of the quarter that's underway. And for Q3, we expect seasonal headwinds and lower trading activity across the industry to result in lower revenues and considerably fewer new funded accounts than we saw in Q2. We're focused on the long-term and we're very excited about our product roadmap. We are introducing the next generation to investing in all things money and we believe there is a big opportunity ahead of us. With that, let's turn it over to questions. I'll take that, Irv. Thanks for the question. At this point, we think the best use of our capital is deploying it in the business. We're very much in the growth stage. And so for now, we have no plans to issue any dividends. I'll take this one Vlad. So love the enthusiasm for the brand. I know Robinhood employees get really excited about swag. We'd love to find a way to get that in the hands of our customers. So I can't make a commitment right now. But I will say that we'll go look at this. I think it's a great idea to get our branded merchandise in the hands of our community. I'll take this one as well. Like all brokerages, we monitor the trading activity on our platform. And when we see any potentially manipulative activity on any stock, we take action, primarily that includes sharing that information with regulators so that they can take it from there. So that's our commitment. And we've got a strong team looking at this. So what I tell you is that payment for order flow is regulated already. It's been primarily focused on disclosures. And we do provide all the required disclosures and we do our best to explain how we make money and what payment for order flow is, it's often misunderstood, component of our business and so appreciate the question. What I tell you is that over the long-term, our attention is to be the single money app. That implies more products, more features and innovation as Vlad was talking about, not just on the existing products that we have, but certainly on new products. We want to be the single place that our customers go to for all things money. And that will lead to naturally to diversification in our revenue streams over time. Next? So I will tell you that, we tend as a management team to really focus on the long-term. And as I just mentioned, we want to be the single money app. And so that really is about rolling out new products and new features. That said in the short-term, we have a number of things that are on our roadmaps that we're going to deliver. We take a lot of cues from our customers and as Vlad mentioned earlier, they're asking for more functionality, more coins in the crypto space. I think there is opportunities to roll out products that will increase returns for customers as well as us through fully paid securities lending. And we're pretty excited about our cash management product. We announced that our cash management now has over 5 million customers. We think that's really interesting place for us to offer more value, get higher adoption and also generate more returns for shareholders, so a lot of opportunity in front of us. Yes, thanks for the question. What I tell you in terms of like our capability, Robinhood has a history of doing challenging projects go itself clearing for an example was certainly a heavy lift. And something that the team successfully did, it helped us verticalize our platform, I think positions as well to grow incredibly fast over time, and really control our own destiny, more than if we just partnered with a third party. So I think we have the capability to do it. And certainly others in the industry do internalize or even market make as a way to monetize the flow. So I think it's a viable option for us. In terms of the economics, before I even go there, I'd tell you that, our view internally is that we don't expect payment for order flow to be banned. That's just not what we think. We expect it to be an active dialogue. I think that the regulators are asking for a study to be done, and we'll definitely engage. What I tell you is that, with a little bit of context before Robinhood, small investors were paying commissions on top of payment for order flow. And it kept a lot of people out. And so never before has investing in this country been cheaper and I think you can see by the 22.5 million customers that we have, that breaking down that barrier of commissions has been just good. And so we'll be definitely defending our customers and making sure that we don't put up barriers that have been taken down and kept people out. In terms of internalization, I probably don't want to go too far in terms of the economics, we have looked at it, we do think, because payment for order flow is such a small revenue stream, it's about $0.02 to $0.025 per $100 traded, that it's not a terribly difficult revenue stream for us to replace. Thanks for your question. Buy versus build, I think, I don't want to go too far down on that. But I'd tell you that, we've got confidence in us to build it, but buying certainly is an option for us. And we would look at both in that scenario. In terms of the part of your question about graduation risk, what I would tell you is that we fully intend to grow with our customers, you see that in our product roadmap. As we talked about wanting new investors to become long-term investors that's really going to inspire the products that we've allowed and account pieces that we roll out, so that we don't see that. And then what I would tell you is, when we look at churn, we're not seeing any kind of customer demographic concentration that will be a concern. Yes, you bet. Yes, what I would say is, in Q2, certainly a large cohort came in about 4.5 million net funded accounts in the quarter, which was near a record, Q1 was slightly higher. So this was the first time that we've seen more first trades in crypto versus equities. And we love the momentum of our cryptocurrency business with over 60% of our customers overall trading during the period. What I'd tell you on cohorts, it's a bit early to look at the newer cohorts and project out. But when we look at cohorts over time, I think you've heard us say that they tend to start small, they're highly engaged, they grow with us both in terms of the revenue that they generate for us, as well as the net deposits that they put on the platform. And so far, there's nothing to suggest that that won't continue. Yes. So, as you know, kind of historically, we've seen the majority of our customers coming to us, either organically or through our customer referral channel, we saw similar rates by channel in Q2. Looking forward, we expect to continue to have a robust customer referral platform. We are investing in more broad scale brand advertising to get our message out to customers. And so you should expect to see us to continue to invest in those kinds of messaging. But structurally, we've been very efficient in the way that we acquire our customers, and we expect to be diligent going forward as well. Yes. Thank you. Yes, what I would tell you, Sean, is that our intention is to pass a ton of value back to customers who are participating with our debit card and cash management product. We're excited about rewards and incentives. And today we pass along the majority of the interest that we earn to customers, certainly at the low interest rate environment becomes interesting. I think over time as the interest rate environment will fluctuate. But we want our customers to look to Robinhood's debit card as their primary form of payment. And we think that that's a really interesting monetization opportunity for us over time. Yes, I would also say that, according to some recent research, about 60% of Americans don't have investments outside of retirement, and a greater percentage of 18- to 29-year-old 68% have no money invested all together. So well even though we've made progress. I think there's a lot to do to encourage greater participation in the markets. Yes, what I would tell you and I sure, I'm sure Vlad has some comments here is, we've done a lot of work over the last year to, year and a half, expanding the platform here domestically, we're in a position to look at each international market, kind of uniquely based on the assets that we have, today we've got a very strong crypto business, we certainly have an investing business. And we also have a, growing cash management business. And so there's a variety of ways that we can approach each international market depending on the circumstances there. In terms of whether or not payment for order flow is accepted, it's not something that we look at as a terribly high barrier for us for investing product internationally, we think, generally speaking, and certainly there's a distinction from geography-to-geography, there's a lot of interest in investing, particularly in U.S. companies. And there's opportunities, whether it's internalization, as was mentioned earlier Forex fees, there's just a number of ways that we could look at monetizing those businesses in the absence of payment for order flow. Yes, of course. Yes, very much. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Robinhood Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be questions and answers from retail shareholders provided by Say Technologies, followed by a live question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Chris Koegel, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Koegel : Thank you, Latif. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Robinhood's fourth quarter earnings call. With us today are CEO and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev; and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's conference call will contain certain forward-looking statements about our financial outlook and plans. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor, are described in our press release issued today, the related slide presentation on our Investor Relations website, our Form 10-Q filed November 2, 2022, and in our other SEC filings. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investors.robinhood.com. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks for the intro, Chris, and thanks to everyone for joining. This earnings call marks the end of our first full calendar year as a public company. And I think it's a great opportunity to really evaluate ourselves and reflect on how the year went, what we promised, what we delivered and how we responded to the twists along the way. Looking back one year, at the Q4 2021 earnings call, we committed to the following things, [expanding] (ph) equities trading hours, which we delivered with hyperextended hours in March; introducing a new day-to-day spending experience, and we delivered Robinhood Cash Card in March also; rolling out our fully paid securities lending product, which we provided with the launch of Stock Lending in May; adding IRAs, which we launched in December with Robinhood Retirement, the first and only IRA with a built-in match, no employer necessary; we committed to providing faster and more money movement options, which we delivered with the launch of debit card funding, instant withdrawals and support for U.S. DC in Robinhood Crypto. And we committed to open up our crypto platform internationally, which we did with the launch of our Noncustodial Robinhood Wallet. When we laid this out a year ago, we didn't anticipate a land war in Europe or inflation at a 40-year high prompting one of the most aggressive tightening policies we've ever seen from the Fed. This led to a sharp drawdown in growth stocks and a frigid crypto winner. All these factors presented extraordinary challenges for our customers and our company to navigate. So nine months ago, we committed to returning to adjusted EBITDA profitability in Q4. This was an aggressive goal, and we delivered it a quarter ahead of schedule by both lowering costs and increasing revenues. We also diversified our business as our net interest revenues more than doubled over the course of the year. And to help customers generate more income in the new environment, we launched a revamped Robinhood Gold that offers customers an incredible 4.15% interest rate on their cash, among the highest rates out there. We also strengthened our core business with a number of improvements to our trading products like options and cash accounts, advanced charts and 24/7 live chat customer support. We did all this and more while having to make some difficult decisions, we ended 2022 with about a third less headcount than a year before. I want to congratulate the team for their tremendous execution. Our product velocity has never been higher, and the quality of talent at Robinhood has never been greater. I also want to mention, and Jason will discuss further in his section that we had a processing error on a corporate action that led to a $57 million expense. This was really disappointing. We've done a full postmortem and remediated the issue. It's important for us to build a culture of accountability. So following this event, I made the decision to eliminate the executive team's 2022 cash bonuses. It's my responsibility to make sure that we learn from this, adjust our systems and processes accordingly and ensure that we do everything we can to prevent errors like this from happening again. Before I review our Q4 product roadmap, I want to provide a couple of shareholder updates. As founders, Baiju and I have always been motivated by our mission, and our goal has been to build a financial services company that does right by our employees, delivers extraordinary value to our customers, and in doing so, generates healthy returns for our shareholders. It took tremendous sacrifice on behalf of many people throughout 2022 to get Robinhood to the healthy position we're in today. And so at the end of the year, Baiju and I were reflecting on this. And we were thinking about whether there was more that we could do personally. So we decided we would cancel nearly $500 million of our combined share-based compensation. This lowers our GAAP operating costs by up to $50 million per quarter starting in Q2, and it has already reduced our fully diluted share count by 3.5%. Second, we also announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue purchasing most or all of the Robinhood shares that Emergent Fidelity Technologies bought last May. The Board and management team are incredibly confident about the future of our business. We also have a fortress balance sheet with over $6 billion of cash and feel very well-positioned to execute on our growth plans. So we think this repurchase will be accretive over time and remove the distraction for shareholders. Since there isn\u2019t much precedent for situations like these, we can\u2019t predict how long this will take, but we\u2019ll keep you posted as is appropriate. Now I\u2019ll cover Q4 business results. While assets under custody was down 4% in Q4 from Q3 due to lower valuations for growth stocks and crypto, customer portfolios had a great start to 2023. In January, as valuations rebounded, customer assets grew by 20% to $75 billion, the highest level in the past nine months. This January outperformance is a good reminder of the importance of investing through the cycle. So we\u2019re encouraged that customers continue to entrust us with billions of dollars each quarter, including nearly $5 billion of net deposits in Q4. Now we\u2019ve talked a lot about our product velocity and all of the new products we launched last year. And as we\u2019ve continued to work on them, we\u2019re now starting to see meaningful traction on several of our new products, which gives us confidence that they can grow into significant business lines over time. First is stock lending, which we launched last May, to help customers generate passive income by lending the stocks they\u2019re holding. It had some good early results by reaching about $15 million of annualized revenue in Q3. Since then, the team has kept iterating on the product relentlessly, speaking with customers, improving onboarding, making more equities available to lend and migrating to a new collateral agent. By the end of January, we had over 1 million customers enrolled, and we generated over $30 million in annualized revenue. As we look ahead, we see lots of opportunities to improve the product even more and make it even more accessible and useful to customers. Next, Robinhood Gold. In September, we launched an industry-leading 3% yield on cash and then raised the yield 3 more times to reach our current 4.15% rate. The customer response has been terrific. As more and more customers feel, we\u2019re giving them access to one of the best and easiest opportunities to earn yield in the U.S. Gold subscribers increased in Q4 for the first time in over a year, and Gold Net Promoter Scores have moved way up. We\u2019ve also seen Gold cash sweep balances grow to $6 billion at the start \u2013 at the end of January. That\u2019s up by about $1 billion per month since the launch. We\u2019re excited to keep investing in our gold offering and deepening these relationships this year. In Q4, we also launched instant withdrawals, a new money movement option to help customers who want faster access to their money for everyday needs at a competitive 1.5% fee. We\u2019re seeing strong early adoption here, growing from 1% of total withdrawals when we launched in October to 7% in January, translating to about $20 million of annualized revenue. These are just a few examples of how the products we\u2019ve launched over the past year are now gaining traction. And we see a path for many of them to drive meaningful revenue growth from here. Finally, I want to give you a preview of our 2023 product road map. While the macro uncertainty is leading some companies to pull back, we plan to stay aggressive as we believe investing through the cycle is the right long-term strategy. So let me highlight a few of the opportunities we\u2019re working on. First, deepening relationships with our existing customers. As we grow into a larger, more diversified company, we\u2019re shifting our focus from just adding users to driving net deposits as well. Retirement is off to a good start. And we\u2019re working to take our first steps on the path to advisory, which can bring even more customers into the market in the future. Second is becoming the best destination for advanced customers. Last year, we made a ton of progress by launching several new products and features that drove advanced customer NPS significantly higher, a great sign for growth and retention. This year, we\u2019ll go beyond tools and improved experience and really innovate for our advanced customers. We\u2019re excited to show you what we have in store. Third, international. We recently launched Robinhood Wallet, which empowers customers around the world to custody their own crypto. We\u2019re getting more aggressive this year and have set a goal to offer brokerage services in the UK by the end of 2023. I\u2019m also excited that we hired JB Mackenzie, an industry veteran from Schwab and TD Ameritrade to lead our international brokerage efforts. We\u2019re really excited about the year ahead. The road map is full, and there\u2019s so much to do. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jason.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. It\u2019s good to speak with everyone today. In the fourth quarter, we stayed focused on serving customers, growing our business and driving long-term shareholder value. Our team continued to deliver on our product road map, and we generated positive adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in a row. I\u2019m proud of what we accomplished last year and look forward to 2023. Before I discuss our Q4 results, I want to provide context around the error that Vlad mentioned. Each quarter, we process hundreds of corporate actions as part of our day-to-day operations. In December, we received notification of a corporate action that was irregular, both in its timing and format and unfortunately got through our controls. Cosmos Health Inc., a NASDAQ-listed company, affected a one for 25 reverse stock split on December 16. A processing error caused us to sell shares short into the market. And although it was detected quickly, it resulted in a loss of $57 million as we bought back these shares against a rising stock price. While this event was an outlier, as Vlad said, we\u2019re taking it very seriously and have made the necessary changes to do everything we can to ensure this won\u2019t happen again. With that, let\u2019s look at the fourth quarter, starting with business results. We continue to add new customers, growing net funded accounts to 23 million, up about 50,000 from Q3. We\u2019re off to a good start in Q1 as well by adding about 60,000 accounts in January. I\u2019d also note that we only include unique users in our net funded account definition, so this metric doesn\u2019t benefit from existing customers opening retirement accounts. So we\u2019re working on additional disclosure to show how many of our products customers are using. For monthly active users, they were 11.4 million, down 800,000 from Q3, though MAUs increased back to roughly 12 million in January. I\u2019d also note that the vast majority of our customers continue to engage over time even if they aren\u2019t active every month. For example, if we look at the last three months of 2022, over 16 million unique customers were active. And if we look over the last six months, that figure grows to over 20 million customers. Turning to assets under custody. While they were $62 billion in Q4, down about 4% from last quarter, they rebounded to $75 billion in January as growth stocks and crypto recovered. Looking at net deposits, they were $4.8 billion in Q4, which translates to a 30% annualized growth for the quarter and brings the full year rate to 19%. We\u2019re encouraged by the resiliency of customer net deposits, which positions us really well for growth as markets rise over time. Now let\u2019s look at Q4 financial results. We grew adjusted EBITDA to $82 million, which was up $35 million from last quarter. This brought our adjusted EBITDA margin to 22% in Q4, which is up nine points from Q3. Going forward, we remain focused on delivering positive adjusted EBITDA and a driving attractive margins over time. Looking at our GAAP results. Q4 EPS was negative $0.19, an improvement of $0.01 from Q3. This included a combined negative $0.08 impact from the processing error and an impairment charge on Ziglu. Q4 EPS prior to these impacts was negative $0.11. Now let\u2019s review our Q4 revenues. Total net revenues were $380 million, a 5% increase from Q3. This was primarily driven by higher net interest revenues, partially offset by lower transaction revenues. Q4 ARPU was $66, up from $63 last quarter. Next, transaction-based revenues were $186 million in Q4, down 11% sequentially, primarily due to lower equity and crypto notional volumes. In January, we saw equity, option and crypto volumes, all roughly in line with Q4 averages. Moving to net interest revenues. They reached a new high of $167 million in Q4, up 30% from Q3. The increase was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates and 12% growth in interest-earning assets. These factors were partially offset by lower margin balances and securities lending activity given the macro environment. Looking ahead to Q1, we are encouraged by what looks like likely to be another quarter of net interest revenue growth. As we consider what we see today for the forward Fed curve, customer balances and deposit rates as well as some pickup in securities lending activity, we anticipate Q1 net interest revenues will be up by roughly $20 million from Q4. Additionally, as we now appear to be in the later stages of the Fed rate hiking cycle, I wanted to note that we\u2019re exploring strategies to reduce our interest rate sensitivity, and we\u2019ll keep you updated when we have more to share on this. Moving on to other revenues. They were $27 million in Q4, up 8% from Q3. Gold subscribers increased by about 50,000 sequentially, and we plan to keep investing so that more of our customers find value in becoming a gold member. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect other revenues to be similar to Q4 levels. Looking a little further ahead, Q2 is proxy season, which drives a seasonal increase in revenue. And late last year, we transferred our proxy services from a third party to our Say Technologies team. So in Q2, we expect to see a sequential increase of about $30 million from Q1 levels. Now let\u2019s look at Q4 expenses. Prior to SBC, the processing error and some minor carryover from our Q3 restructuring, OpEx was $319 million, which brought our full year total to $1.55 billion. These 2022 results were an 18% improvement versus the prior year as we moved to a leaner cost structure. Looking forward to 2023, we\u2019re planning to improve our costs by another 7% on average as we plan to keep our cost lean, while investing for future growth. Our outlook for 2023 OpEx prior to SBC is a range of $1.42 billion to $1.48 billion. I\u2019d note that on a quarterly basis, this outlook is about the same as the Q4 2022 range we provided last quarter, as I think this is a good zone to operate our business this year. Turning to SBC, it was $160 million in Q4, which brings our full year total to $654 million. Looking ahead, Vlad and Baiju\u2019s decision to cancel their 2021 pre-IPO market-based awards significantly lowers our outlook for the back half of this year. Under accounting rules, we will record a Q1 non-cash charge of about $485 million for the full acceleration of the canceled awards. We also expect SBC this year, excluding the charge will be in a range of $470 million to $550 million, which is a 22% improvement on average from last year. Including the charge, our full year 2023 SBC outlook is a range of $955 million to $1.035 billion. For Q1, we expect SBC of $615 million to $645 million mostly from the accounting charge. Given our progress on costs over the past year and improved SBC outlook, we now expect to get much closer to positive GAAP net income in the back half of this year. Beyond that, we think it\u2019s a little early to predict a specific timeline for reaching GAAP profitability as our revenues vary with the market backdrop. That said, we\u2019re focused on getting there by keeping our costs lean and scrappy to drive operating leverage as our business grows, while staying flexible to invest for the long-term. Now to capital management. I want to touch on a couple areas, first, on the Ziglu deal. After careful consideration, Robinhood terminated the deal and we booked a $12 million charge in Q4. Second, as Vlad mentioned, our Board authorized us subject to final approval to purchase our shares that Emergent Fidelity Technologies bought in May of last year. We\u2019re confident in the future of our business, so we think it would be a smart use of our excess corporate cash to buy most or all of the roughly 55 million shares, while continuing to have a strong balance sheet to invest for growth. In closing, I\u2019m really pleased with all that we accomplished in 2022, delivering on our product roadmap, moving to a lean and scrappy cost structure, and ending the year with two straight quarters of adjusted EBITDA profitability. As we look ahead, we see a large opportunity to grow shareholder value from here. And with that, Chris, let\u2019s move to Q&A.\nA - Chris Koegel: Thank you, Jason. Leading into this quarter\u2019s Q&A session, we\u2019ll start by answering some of the top questions from Say Technologies ranked by number of votes. We\u2019ll pass over any questions that were answered on the call already or in prior quarters, and group together questions that share a common theme. After that, we\u2019ll turn to live questions from our analysts. So we\u2019ll kick it off with some of our top questions from Say. So first, so John P asks, what does the product roadmap look like for 2023? Vlad, do you want to take that one?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. Thank you as always, Sajan for the good questions. So I mentioned a little bit in the call, while the macro environment might be leading some companies to be less aggressive, we plan to stay aggressive. And there\u2019s three things that we\u2019re focused on in terms of product roadmap, the first thing, deepening relationships with our existing customers. And you\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve been very successful in providing value in terms of higher interest on cash with our Gold product. We also rolled out Retirement and are very excited to offer the first IRA with a built in match, no employer needed. We think it\u2019s particularly useful for gig economy workers and other freelancers. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest in that and grow that. We think that gives us sort of a great entry point towards offering advisory services to customers. Second, becoming the best place for advanced customers. So this is our customers that trade a little bit more actively, use options, engage in equities trading. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress this year and we\u2019re working even harder to deliver innovative new functionality for our more advanced customers. And then the third international, so we recently launched Robinhood Wallet, we\u2019re also working aggressively this year to bring brokerage services internationally. And we\u2019re excited to welcome JB who will be leading the efforts to take our brokerage internationally.\nChris Koegel: Great. All right, thank you, Vlad. The next questions from Jason R who asks, when will Robinhood go global and allow users to buy individual shares from all over the world listed exchanges?\nVlad Tenev: Sure. Happy to field that one. So there\u2019s really two questions there. First of all, for our U.S. customers, we\u2019re very focused on expanding selection and being the best place for you to invest in trade. In terms of access to foreign securities, customers can trade ADRs today via our platform commission free, and that gives investors exposure to foreign traded stocks. The second thing, expanding our operations internationally so that customers based in other countries can access Robinhood services. A huge part of our mission, we think that we\u2019ve done a lot of great work to open up access and to make investing more accessible to people in the U.S. U.S. is comparatively a mature market where access is pretty good relative to some parts of the world. So we think it\u2019s a natural extension of our mission and a great business opportunity to take our technology and make it available overseas. I talked about Robinhood Wallet, which is available globally and will allow customers all over the world to self-custody, have control over their crypto and trade and swap with no network fees. On the brokerage side, we\u2019re being more aggressive and set a goal to start brokerage operations in the UK this year. So look out for that. We\u2019re very, very excited to make Robinhood available all over the world.\nChris Koegel: Awesome. Thanks, Vlad. All right. The next question comes from GC who asks, there\u2019s a new feature that was implemented by Twitter that directly links users to the Robinhood app. What\u2019s the relationship between Robinhood and Twitter? Is there an official partnership forthcoming?\nVlad Tenev: Yes, sure. Thank you, G. Part of the mission of democratizing finance for all is giving access to the best information whenever and wherever customers need it. So we\u2019ve been speaking to the folks over at Twitter for a while and heard about what they were doing with the stock pages and crypto pages on their platform. And we got excited to create an investing experience that gives value to their customers and makes it easier at a deep link to the Robinhood app. So you\u2019ll see us experimenting with more things like this over time. As of now, we don\u2019t have any plans to expand or form an official partnership with Twitter.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you. Okay, so the next question is from William C. What happens if the SEC bans payment for order flow?\nVlad Tenev: Sure, I\u2019ll field this one. The first thing to note here is, as you\u2019ve seen through the quarterly results and the progress we\u2019ve made in diversifying our business, we\u2019ve got a diversified business and are continuing to grow. And we feel like we\u2019re incredibly well positioned. In terms of payment for order flow and the SEC market structure proposals, we think investors have it great right now. The all in costs of investing, the accessibility, the tools and functionality have never been better. And we\u2019re worried that these proposals have the potential to give investors worse execution quality and higher prices in many instances. And these are really complex proposals. It\u2019ll take a long time to work through them. Ultimately we think they are unlikely to pass in their current form. So we\u2019re going to keep working with the SEC, including our comment letter coming soon and make sure customers continue to receive the best deal and have access to equities trading and make sure we\u2019re continuing to advocate for what we think is right for our customers.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. The next question is related. So it asks will \u2013 from Mark D, will Robinhood become a member of the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ and reduce its reliance on payment for order flow?\nVlad Tenev: We actually are already a member of NASDAQ. We have a connection there, and a portion of customer orders are routed there. The way that we think about execution quality and routing orders is the routing is based on execution quality. That\u2019s really the deciding factor. So we aim to send customer orders where they\u2019re getting the best execution quality. And we actually publish execution quality statistics on our website and are very proud of it.\nChris Koegel: All right. The next question is for Jason. Will Robinhood ever work with tax companies like TurboTax to get tax information to clients at a faster pace?\nJason Warnick: Thanks. We already work with TurboTax. And in fact customers get a $15 discount if they upload to TurboTax. We\u2019ve been making a number of changes to the tax experience for customers. This year, we consolidated the tax form for customers who are trading both equities and crypto. So they receive a single tax form from Robinhood this year, which makes it a lot more convenient. And also we\u2019re sending in a form that makes it really easy for customers to upload their data to the tax software of their choice. And then also we\u2019ve already sent well ahead of the deadline millions of these forms out to customers and should have the remaining ones out really soon. So we\u2019re making a lot of progress for customers on the tax front and proud of the team for doing that.\nChris Koegel: Great. Thanks, Jason. All right, let\u2019s do one more before we open the call to analysts. So Vlad, GC asks, any thoughts on creating a Robinhood Pro app with more advanced charts, tools, data and live streaming newsfeeds and chat rooms to keep the more advanced users strict \u2013 staying strictly on Robinhood?\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, G. So we think serving our advanced customers is incredibly important. As I outlined a bit earlier, it\u2019s one of the top three things we\u2019re working on this year. We made a lot of progress last year really improving the experience for them, and we spent a lot of time talking to our advanced customers. And what we\u2019re hearing is they stay with Robinhood and they love Robinhood because we make things simple and are easy to use. And they actually love the flexibility to be able to see a very simple overview of their portfolio and their holdings and be able to trade simply along with the flexibility to dive into things like advanced charts and tools and features when they need to. So right now we think we can deliver on an awesome experience for advanced customers within the existing Robinhood app. And so we\u2019re not necessarily going to be creating a separate app, but we\u2019re focused on making Robinhood the best tool for our advanced customers.\nChris Koegel: All right, thanks, Vlad. And thank you for everyone for your questions. We really appreciate all the thoughtful engagement from our shareholders and customers. And now it\u2019s time to open up the line for analyst questions. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it to Latif.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Please proceed, Devin.\nDevin Ryan: Thanks so much. Good afternoon, Vlad and Jason.\nVlad Tenev: Hi, Devin.\nDevin Ryan: First question. Obviously, nice to see the acceleration and the solidly positive adjusted EBITDA which has been driven more by getting leaner on expenses. And so if you do start to see an acceleration in engagement from some of your newer initiatives, or just a broader improvement in the operating environment, should we expect that you would potentially re-ramp on certain growth investments? Or are you comfortable you can execute at the speed that you want to kind of at the new leaner model? And obviously that would imply more would fall to the bottom line. And really the question is, how you want to manage the business over time as you kind of get to eventually this GAAP profitability? Is it further expanding profitability from there, or you then happy to kind of then re-lean in on growth investment?\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Devin. This is Jason. I\u2019ll take it. And then Vlad can add in if he has additional color. We think there\u2019s a lot of leverage that we can achieve as we grow our business over time. We\u2019re going to continue to manage our cost to stay lean. That said, we\u2019ll have some flexibility to lean in a little bit more on investments that we think are the right ones to make. But the guidance that we\u2019ve given incorporates the investments that we\u2019re planning for the things that we\u2019ve talked about and have in our plan for this year. So we feel really good about the range that we\u2019ve given on OpEx given our growth plans.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. The only thing I would add is last year was in terms of products, one of the best years we\u2019ve had. We\u2019ve rolled out lots of new products to customers. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, to have two of our recent products in a relatively short amount of time get to double-digit millions in ARR in a year like 2022, we\u2019re incredibly proud of. So Stock Lending, as we mentioned, getting to a $30 million run rate, instant withdrawals within a couple of months of launch, getting to $20 million. So we have new businesses that we were able to roll out and I think this year we\u2019re in a great position to keep investing and be aggressive.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Terrific. Follow-up just on crypto. So customer engagement in crypto really saw some pressure after the FTX-related contagion and obviously following valuations as well. At the start of the year, we are seeing some improvement in valuations. And so just curious from what you guys can track internally. Does it feel like customers primarily just move to the sidelines versus exiting the space altogether? And related, how did those events from the fourth quarter effect? How you're thinking about just the crypto offering more broadly? How you're budgeting for and developing the road map, if at all? Thanks.\nJason Warnick: So Devin, we have seen a pickup in the first part of the year to levels that are kind of on par with the average for Q4. So I'd say it was a bit of a step on the sideline, watch a little bit, particularly in the month of December. But we're definitely encouraged with what we're seeing in the first part of the year and really into February. We continue to think that crypto is here to stay, and we're continuing to invest in this space and are really optimistic.\nVlad Tenev: Yes, you probably saw we recently launched a Robinhood Wallet, which really gives the power and utility of self-custody to customers. And we're continuing throughout the year to make improvements to our core Robinhood crypto offering as well.\nDevin Ryan: Got it, okay, terrific. Thanks so much.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks Devin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Will.\nWill Nance: Hey, guys. Good evening. Appreciate you taking the question. I think you made some comments in the prepared remarks around thinking about the level of asset sensitivity and interest rate sensitivity, the kind of tools that you can use to bring that down. I'm wondering if you could expand a little bit on what types of things that you are contemplating? And just maybe thought through a framework for how you might approach it? For instance, is there a situation where you think you could remain EBITDA breakeven or positive even if we see significant fall in interest rates over the next couple of years? Thanks.\nJason Warnick: Yes. Well, it's a great question. Look, it's not lost on us that net interest revenue is a rising and important part of our mix, and it's something that we're paying really close attention to. It's a little early to talk about the specific strategies that we're looking at. But really just wanted to signal to shareholders that it's something that we're paying attention to, and we look forward to implementing some strategies that will decrease the sensitivity that we have there. So we'll update you over time. But unfortunately, I probably shouldn't get too far into the details I'd be getting ahead of myself.\nWill Nance: Understood. Appreciate that. And then maybe a question for Vlad on M&A strategy. You laid out a handful of things in today's release, international expansion, more retirement. I think you mentioned advisory. I guess, just how are you thinking about the role of M&A in your product road map? It seems like you guys have gone the internal route for the majority of your new products, if I think about securities lending, retirement thus far. But any kind of change in that approach or any thoughts around where you get more aggressive on the M&A front?\nVlad Tenev: Yes, you're right, Will, that we feel very confident in our ability to roll out products and sort of independently build new features that serve our customers. That said, it's not lost upon us that we have a large balance sheet. And the environment now is going to create some opportunities. So we have done M&A in the past. We're very deliberate about the opportunities that we're considering. We consider things like acceleration of our road map, team quality and fit. And we're proud of the M&A that we've done thus far. Jason mentioned Say Technologies. I think that team has integrated very well and is driving considerable business impact in terms of revenue to Robinhood. So I think we've had a good deliberate approach, and we do see opportunities with our balance sheet going forward.\nWill Nance: Got it. Appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks Will.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your question please, Steven.\nSteven Chubak: Hey, good afternoon. So it was certainly encouraging to hear some of the positive commentary around retail engagement starting to improve, certainly seeing some inflection in some of those brokerage metrics. If I think about the narrative with regard to the fundamentals in 2022, it was subdued retail engagement, NII tailwinds, better cost control. And given that the rate sensitive revenues are arguably close to peaking, the expense guidance for full year 2023 implies modest growth, well controlled, but still growth versus that 4Q 2022 exit rate. It really does feel like the path to profitability is almost exclusively contingent on better retail engagement metrics. I wanted to understand, first, if the engagement moderates, how much flex you have in the model to bend the cost curve? And then second, and this is more nuanced, but on GAAP profitability, the expense guidance for full year is $1.95 billion. The 1Q revenue guide implies closer to low 1 6s. And just wanted to understand what the revenue or growth levers you can pull to help you close that gap? Certainly, the KPIs are improving, but just want to get a better sense as to how we can reconcile that path to GAAP profitability as well.\nJason Warnick: Yes. So the first part of your question is just what kind of levers we have on cost. 2022 marked a big shift towards getting lean and being productive. I think there's more opportunity there. I wouldn't say that there's the kind of opportunity that we were able to realize in 2022. But you should expect us to continue to find ways to be more efficient across the company and serve our customers great even while being super-efficient. We're feeling really good at the level that we're at. We think it's a good level to operate in 2023. But that said, there's always ways to be more efficient. And I know the finance team, the engineering team and others across the company are constantly looking for ways to optimize our costs. And so I wouldn't say we're as low as we could possibly be right now. And certainly, about a third of the increase in our kind of run rate costs into 2023 are about pursuing new growth initiatives and growing the business, which I think kind of takes us into the second part of your question is what are we doing to drive growth? And you heard Vlad talk about all the initiatives that we rolled out last year and highlight a few of them that are starting to get some traction on a revenue basis. We want to build a portfolio of businesses and services over time that can each in its own right become like nine-figure and growing revenue contributions. Some of them will get going faster than others, but it's a long-term effort for us. And we're going to keep investing and keep planting seeds, including just by improving the experience that we're offering on our existing businesses. If you take fully paid securities lending, for example, when we initially rolled that out, we had \u2013 in the first few months, we had an ARR run rate of about $15 million. And that's great. That's a great way to kind of get started on a new business. But the team didn't stop. They kept iterating. They kept finding ways to get more people to adopt, to get more efficient and better tools in the hands of our trading desk. And now we're running at a $30 million ARR. And there's a direct line between all the work and all the iteration that's been going on since launch. And so you're going to see us launch products, you're going to see us iterate on those products and just keep driving for improvement. And I think when you add all that together, it leads to revenue growth over time.\nSteven Chubak: Lots of singles and doubles, got it. If I could just squeeze in one more, just ticky-tack modeling question. You mentioned the reaffirmed the dilution of 4% or less in 2023 in terms of share count. Does that contemplate any of the buybacks or planned buybacks of the FTX Founder shares? And is there any appetite to initiate buybacks, just given the improved EBITDA profitability that you're seeing?\nJason Warnick: Yes. Thanks for your question. No, it doesn't incorporate any anticipated repurchase of those Emergent Fidelity Technology shares. So a good clarification there. And in terms of kind of ongoing repurchases at this point, we're just focused on buying the shares that we had talked about and we'll save for later. As we think about capital management, we really want to be investing in the business for growth, having flexibility to complement that organic growth through M&A and then kind of as a third option in priority order would be thinking about returning value to shareholders through things like repurchases. So nothing to announce there and nothing to signal either.\nSteven Chubak: Great color. Thank you so much for taking my questions, Vlad and Jason.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Repetto of Piper Sandler. Your question please, Richard.\nRichard Repetto: Yes, good evening, Vlad. Good evening, Jason and team. \nJason Warnick: Good evening.\nRichard Repetto: And first, congrats on the right \u2013 quickly rightsizing the company last year. So I also want to thank you for given all the color on the, I guess, sort of the rebound in engagement in January. And I guess, two sort of questions. Does that include \u2013 we saw deleveraging in the brokerage. We saw your margin balances, not just U.S., but across the industry drop. So how are margin balances? And you gave us half the picture of the engagement. I think a lot of people are wondering how profitable these flows are from retail investors? Can you \u2013 could you just sort of give it qualitatively at the capture rates of what you\u2019re making the spreads, et cetera, that determine the payment [indiscernible] have they improved as well in January?\nJason Warnick: Yes. So in terms of the margin book, we have seen it move up. I wouldn\u2019t say it was a big move up in January, but it has moved up slightly from the levels that we saw right at the end of the year. In terms of the take rate on equity PFOF, nothing has changed structurally there. It moves with kind of the mix of what our customers are buying and selling as well as the level of spreads on the things that they\u2019re buying and selling. So that\u2019s probably all the color really I have on the take rate.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. And my one follow-up. You\u2019ve done a great job at diversifying the revenues and the new product rollout. So can you give \u2013 just given \u2013 I still think there\u2019s probably a few more hikes coming. So what\u2019s the sensitivity, Jason, to the next Fed rate hike?\nJason Warnick: Yes. So what we said for next quarter is that we think interest revenues will move up about $20 million versus what we saw in Q4. We\u2019re providing a schedule in our investor presentation that kind of lays out the $18 billion of interest-earning assets. What you expect is when those rates come that a good majority of that should flow through against those interest-earning assets, offset by anything that we pass along to our customers. And in that regard, we look primarily at the gold cash sweep. And our rate right now is 4.15. So the take rate there relative to the Fed funds effective is roughly 50 basis points. We\u2019re giving over 400 basis points by comparison to our customers. So the vast majority of that is going to customers. And really, when we think about pricing on that, we just want to be at or near or kind of with the top of the market in comparable offerings, which we think we\u2019re doing a really good job and customers are seeing and reacting to.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Worthington of JPMorgan. Your line is open, Kenneth.\nKenneth Worthington: Hi, good evening or afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So maybe first on the Cash Card, you guys re-launched it. I wanted to follow-up there. How many of your cash management customers have transitioned to the new card? And what is the number of sort of Cash Cards outstanding at this point? I think at the last quarter, it was 500,000. And then if it\u2019s possible, can you give us any insight into the Cash Card customer in terms of like average number of transactions and average size of transactions?\nJason Warnick: Hey Ken, so this is Jason. I\u2019ll take that, and Vlad can jump in with any additional color. So it\u2019s an opt-in rather than opt-out for the cash management customers that are moving over. And so far, we\u2019ve seen kind of a slow uptake in the opt-in to the Cash Card. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at. We\u2019re \u2013 I talked earlier in one of my responses to just iterating and improving our offering. And so we\u2019re talking to customers. We\u2019re working on optimizing the onboarding flow. And we hope to see even more customers choose to adopt the Cash Card. We\u2019re also looking at just the value proposition of the Cash Card. And over time, we\u2019ll continue to iterate on that until we get to a point that we think we\u2019ve got really great product market fit. In terms of the update on the number of kind of card users, it\u2019s around 800,000. So it\u2019s up a couple of hundred thousand since the last time that we shared that with you. And then there\u2019s \u2013 of that 800,000, there\u2019s a minority of that, that are engaging more frequently is kind of top of wallet. And that also is something that we\u2019re looking at to make sure that we just get the value proposition right for customers and get it to where the green Robinhood card just moves up to the top of the stack in our customers\u2019 wallets. So well, it\u2019s early, and we\u2019ll continue to update you as we make progress there.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. The only thing that I would add is, like we said, with stock lending post-launch, we made a ton of improvements to the product and the funnel, and we\u2019re really proud of the work that we continue to do there. With the Cash Card, it\u2019s the same story. We\u2019ve got a great team on it. The road map is full. There\u2019s a lot of exciting things coming. So we\u2019re very excited about how much that product will improve in the near future.\nKenneth Worthington: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then trading volumes have been resilient in options relative to the other asset classes. What is the experience your clients are having in options? Like can you tell, are they making money in options? Is your experience getting better over time? And if they are making money in options, why do you think the experience is better there than in equities and crypto?\nVlad Tenev: Well, one of the things we\u2019ve been really looking at is the Net Promoter Score, the retention characteristics of our options product. And we\u2019ve made a lot of improvements in the past year. At the beginning of 2022, the more advanced customers, the ones that we\u2019re engaging in options a little bit more, were on average less happy with our service than the typical customer and then we were able to reverse that quite aggressively in a relatively short amount of time. And that\u2019s through things like options and cash accounts; better customer support, including 24/7 live chat, which launched a couple of months ago; advanced charts; and more tools there. And we continue to rollout awesome, innovative options features with a lot more coming this year. So really, the options team has been firing on all cylinders. We\u2019re really happy with kind of our relative market share, especially in the light of overall sort of decline in volumes industry-wide. And I think there\u2019s a lot more to do. But a lot of it comes down to just us relentlessly improving the product. And I\u2019m very proud of the work the team has done there.\nJason Warnick: And it\u2019s been, as you know, Ken, just a really challenging macro environment, not just for our customers, but for all market participants, frankly, over the last year or so. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re really excited about being able to offer over 4% yield on the gold, cash sweep program, introducing retirement, which is going to help customers just kind of systematically, dollar cost average over a long period of time to reach their goals. And so really, you\u2019re going to see Robinhood evolve its platform so that no matter how customers want to trade, Robinhood will be the place to do it. And so it\u2019s a long-term strategy for us, but we\u2019re making progress there.\nKenneth Worthington: Great. Thank you very much.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Ken. Appreciate the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your question please, Michael.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good evening, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just coming back to your earlier point around innovating for advanced customers. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate a bit on what additional functionality could helpful that\u2019s not offered today? And to that point, we\u2019ve seen tremendous growth in index options, including some of the smaller-sized index options contracts yet. I do not believe they\u2019re available on the Robinhood customers. Just curious how you think about the opportunity there? What hurdles could they be for adding index options? I understand they\u2019re a bit different in that there cash settled as opposed to net share settle. So how much of a platform built that required? And how does that stack up on the priorities for Robinhood year 2023?\nVlad Tenev: Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll field that one. I don\u2019t want to let the cat out of the bag too early. I think we\u2019ve got some really exciting things in store. Certainly, we\u2019re looking at new assets and new features. And JB and Steve Quirk, awesome teams. They\u2019re putting a great team together. They care a lot about advanced customers. They\u2019ve really done wonderful things in the past with thinkorswim and TD, which really innovated for advanced customers. And I think we\u2019ve got another year we can go here at Robinhood, so stay tuned.\nMichael Cyprys: Any comment on the index option side? Is that something you guys are interested in or not of interest to your customer set?\nVlad Tenev: I think index options are interesting. Again, I shouldn\u2019t comment on any specific assets, but we\u2019re certainly looking at everything.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. If I could just ask a follow-up question on the expense side. You guys have made tremendous progress bringing down the pace of expenses. If I just look at 2023, it looks like the guidance is a little bit of a growth relative to the fourth quarter run rate. So I was just hoping maybe you could unpack some of the moving pieces that are driving expense growth from fourth quarter levels. And maybe you can comment on the headcount growth, inflationary pressures, how that\u2019s all impacting it versus investment spend?\nJason Warnick: Yes. So very, very modest headcount growth. We had a number of open positions at the end of the year. We\u2019re planning to fill those and then very, very modest incremental growth on top of that primarily for funding investments in growth. If you think about the run rate for Q4, excluding share-based compensation, that gets you to roughly $1.3 billion. And then our guidance was $1.42 billion to $1.48 billion for the year. So to unpack that a bit, there\u2019s really three categories of incremental growth versus the run rate from the fourth quarter. Each of them represent roughly a third, so a third, a third and a third for the following categories. The first is just kind of, first, you got to normalize Q4 spend for things like seasonality as well as we\u2019re assuming that we fully fund our company\u2019s bonus program in 2023, whereas we\u2019re paying much less than fully funded in 2022, given the macro environment and how the year went for us. And so you kind of \u2013 if you take seasonality and that bonus effect, that\u2019s roughly a third of the incremental off the Q4\u2019s run rate. The second is just existing business growth, continuing to deliver and improve on the existing products that we have. It includes things like merit increases for employee compensation that happens regularly on an annual basis. Pull-through of expenses that started kind of late in the year and you get the full year effect. And then the third category also, as I mentioned, roughly a thirdof the incremental is just investing for new business growth. And so that really bridges the baseline to the guidance.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish of Barclays. Your line is open, Benjamin.\nBenjamin Budish: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the UK launch. I understand that it\u2019s \u2013 the target is for the end of the year, but we sort of understood that Ziglu was expected to be a little bit of a launching off point and with that deal no longer happening, if you could share any thoughts on kind of your go-to-market strategy? Or are you thinking about leading more with the Robinhood Wallet? And kind of how do you think about the competitive environment over there?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. Happy to field that. So the Robinhood Wallet is global by default. It\u2019s a self-custodial Web 3 Wallet that offers trading and swapping with no network fees. So that we\u2019re very excited about. A separate app from the main Robinhood app, which offers brokerage services. And the goal for this year will be getting brokerage services live in the UK by the end of the year.\nBenjamin Budish: Okay, great. Thanks so much. If I could sneak one in as well. Just on your net interest revenue, you beat your own kind of guidance pretty nicely in the quarter. I guess, where are you sort of the most surprised? And if we\u2019re thinking about the first quarter, where would you expect to \u2013 if there were a similar outperformance, where would you think that would be most likely to come from?\nJason Warnick: Thank you. I don\u2019t want to predict where the outperformance might come in the following quarter. Certainly, it\u2019s sensitive to the interest-earning assets that we carry. Movements in things like the margin book could definitely be a lever outperformance and the securities lending would be another area that, that might surprise. In Q4, we did outperform our expectations that owed mostly to just nice asset growth and a little bit better on deposit betas than we had forecast into the model.\nBenjamin Budish: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Markgraff of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question please, Alex.\nAlex Markgraff: Hey, Vlad. Hey, Jason. A couple of questions. I just wanted to jump back to, I guess, first, Robinhood Wallet. Just wanted to understand how you feel about the completeness of the offering at this point and kind of parity versus global peers on the wallet side? And then just any sort of planned marketing initiatives in international markets for 2023 to keep in mind?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. On the wallet side, I think the core functionality is in place, and we\u2019re getting great feedback from customers. There are a bunch of things that we\u2019re looking to add to make it even better. And the road map for that team is pretty full, and they\u2019ve been executing pretty relentlessly. So kudos to the wallet team for that. And then \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, you had a question about international beyond that\u2026\nAlex Markgraff: International marketing.\nVlad Tenev: Marketing? Yes. It\u2019s really early for us. Of course, we\u2019re open to doing marketing in the future. But right now, we\u2019re focused on rolling out the product and getting as much feedback from the users on the wait list as possible.\nAlex Markgraff: Awesome. And then just on UK brokerage, I guess, maybe just to expand on the earlier question. I mean, what are some kind of key operational mileposts that we should be thinking of as you look to launch that by year-end?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. It\u2019s mainly just making sure the technology is in really good shape, and we adhere to all the different requirements for the UK market, making the experience seamless with the Forex money conversions and things like that and talking to customers and making sure that we do any UK-specific adaptations that we think will make the product as useful as possible for them. But we think we have a great foundation. We\u2019ve made really big improvements in our infrastructure and technology over the past couple of years. So scaling, we don\u2019t anticipate it will be a problem. It\u2019s more about just getting the user experience and getting everything set up there.\nJason Warnick: So this is Jason. We\u2019re hearing from our PR team that one of the news outlets is incorrectly reporting that Robinhood is affecting a split on our stock. I just want to be super clear that, that is not any plan that we have. It\u2019s not factually accurate. And so for all those listening, if you can spread the correct news, that would be fantastic. Thank you.\nAlex Markgraff: Thank you.\nOperator: We don\u2019t have any more questions. I would now like to turn the conference back to Vlad Tenev for closing remarks.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you, everyone. Really appreciate the questions, and we will see you all next quarter, some of you sooner.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thanks for the intro, Chris, and thanks to everyone for joining. This earnings call marks the end of our first full calendar year as a public company. And I think it's a great opportunity to really evaluate ourselves and reflect on how the year went, what we promised, what we delivered and how we responded to the twists along the way. Looking back one year, at the Q4 2021 earnings call, we committed to the following things, [expanding] (ph) equities trading hours, which we delivered with hyperextended hours in March; introducing a new day-to-day spending experience, and we delivered Robinhood Cash Card in March also; rolling out our fully paid securities lending product, which we provided with the launch of Stock Lending in May; adding IRAs, which we launched in December with Robinhood Retirement, the first and only IRA with a built-in match, no employer necessary; we committed to providing faster and more money movement options, which we delivered with the launch of debit card funding, instant withdrawals and support for U.S. DC in Robinhood Crypto. And we committed to open up our crypto platform internationally, which we did with the launch of our Noncustodial Robinhood Wallet. When we laid this out a year ago, we didn't anticipate a land war in Europe or inflation at a 40-year high prompting one of the most aggressive tightening policies we've ever seen from the Fed. This led to a sharp drawdown in growth stocks and a frigid crypto winner. All these factors presented extraordinary challenges for our customers and our company to navigate. So nine months ago, we committed to returning to adjusted EBITDA profitability in Q4. This was an aggressive goal, and we delivered it a quarter ahead of schedule by both lowering costs and increasing revenues. We also diversified our business as our net interest revenues more than doubled over the course of the year. And to help customers generate more income in the new environment, we launched a revamped Robinhood Gold that offers customers an incredible 4.15% interest rate on their cash, among the highest rates out there. We also strengthened our core business with a number of improvements to our trading products like options and cash accounts, advanced charts and 24/7 live chat customer support. We did all this and more while having to make some difficult decisions, we ended 2022 with about a third less headcount than a year before. I want to congratulate the team for their tremendous execution. Our product velocity has never been higher, and the quality of talent at Robinhood has never been greater. I also want to mention, and Jason will discuss further in his section that we had a processing error on a corporate action that led to a $57 million expense. This was really disappointing. We've done a full postmortem and remediated the issue. It's important for us to build a culture of accountability. So following this event, I made the decision to eliminate the executive team's 2022 cash bonuses. It's my responsibility to make sure that we learn from this, adjust our systems and processes accordingly and ensure that we do everything we can to prevent errors like this from happening again. Before I review our Q4 product roadmap, I want to provide a couple of shareholder updates. As founders, Baiju and I have always been motivated by our mission, and our goal has been to build a financial services company that does right by our employees, delivers extraordinary value to our customers, and in doing so, generates healthy returns for our shareholders. It took tremendous sacrifice on behalf of many people throughout 2022 to get Robinhood to the healthy position we're in today. And so at the end of the year, Baiju and I were reflecting on this. And we were thinking about whether there was more that we could do personally. So we decided we would cancel nearly $500 million of our combined share-based compensation. This lowers our GAAP operating costs by up to $50 million per quarter starting in Q2, and it has already reduced our fully diluted share count by 3.5%. Second, we also announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized us to pursue purchasing most or all of the Robinhood shares that Emergent Fidelity Technologies bought last May. The Board and management team are incredibly confident about the future of our business. We also have a fortress balance sheet with over $6 billion of cash and feel very well-positioned to execute on our growth plans. So we think this repurchase will be accretive over time and remove the distraction for shareholders. Since there isn't much precedent for situations like these, we can't predict how long this will take, but we'll keep you posted as is appropriate. Now I'll cover Q4 business results. While assets under custody was down 4% in Q4 from Q3 due to lower valuations for growth stocks and crypto, customer portfolios had a great start to 2023. In January, as valuations rebounded, customer assets grew by 20% to $75 billion, the highest level in the past nine months. This January outperformance is a good reminder of the importance of investing through the cycle. So we're encouraged that customers continue to entrust us with billions of dollars each quarter, including nearly $5 billion of net deposits in Q4. Now we've talked a lot about our product velocity and all of the new products we launched last year. And as we've continued to work on them, we're now starting to see meaningful traction on several of our new products, which gives us confidence that they can grow into significant business lines over time. First is stock lending, which we launched last May, to help customers generate passive income by lending the stocks they're holding. It had some good early results by reaching about $15 million of annualized revenue in Q3. Since then, the team has kept iterating on the product relentlessly, speaking with customers, improving onboarding, making more equities available to lend and migrating to a new collateral agent. By the end of January, we had over 1 million customers enrolled, and we generated over $30 million in annualized revenue. As we look ahead, we see lots of opportunities to improve the product even more and make it even more accessible and useful to customers. Next, Robinhood Gold. In September, we launched an industry-leading 3% yield on cash and then raised the yield 3 more times to reach our current 4.15% rate. The customer response has been terrific. As more and more customers feel, we're giving them access to one of the best and easiest opportunities to earn yield in the U.S. Gold subscribers increased in Q4 for the first time in over a year, and Gold Net Promoter Scores have moved way up. We've also seen Gold cash sweep balances grow to $6 billion at the start \u2013 at the end of January. That's up by about $1 billion per month since the launch. We're excited to keep investing in our gold offering and deepening these relationships this year. In Q4, we also launched instant withdrawals, a new money movement option to help customers who want faster access to their money for everyday needs at a competitive 1.5% fee. We're seeing strong early adoption here, growing from 1% of total withdrawals when we launched in October to 7% in January, translating to about $20 million of annualized revenue. These are just a few examples of how the products we've launched over the past year are now gaining traction. And we see a path for many of them to drive meaningful revenue growth from here. Finally, I want to give you a preview of our 2023 product road map. While the macro uncertainty is leading some companies to pull back, we plan to stay aggressive as we believe investing through the cycle is the right long-term strategy. So let me highlight a few of the opportunities we're working on. First, deepening relationships with our existing customers. As we grow into a larger, more diversified company, we're shifting our focus from just adding users to driving net deposits as well. Retirement is off to a good start. And we're working to take our first steps on the path to advisory, which can bring even more customers into the market in the future. Second is becoming the best destination for advanced customers. Last year, we made a ton of progress by launching several new products and features that drove advanced customer NPS significantly higher, a great sign for growth and retention. This year, we'll go beyond tools and improved experience and really innovate for our advanced customers. We're excited to show you what we have in store. Third, international. We recently launched Robinhood Wallet, which empowers customers around the world to custody their own crypto. We're getting more aggressive this year and have set a goal to offer brokerage services in the UK by the end of 2023. I'm also excited that we hired JB Mackenzie, an industry veteran from Schwab and TD Ameritrade to lead our international brokerage efforts. We're really excited about the year ahead. The road map is full, and there's so much to do. With that, I'll turn it over to Jason. Yes. Thank you as always, Sajan for the good questions. So I mentioned a little bit in the call, while the macro environment might be leading some companies to be less aggressive, we plan to stay aggressive. And there's three things that we're focused on in terms of product roadmap, the first thing, deepening relationships with our existing customers. And you've seen that we've been very successful in providing value in terms of higher interest on cash with our Gold product. We also rolled out Retirement and are very excited to offer the first IRA with a built in match, no employer needed. We think it's particularly useful for gig economy workers and other freelancers. So we're going to continue to invest in that and grow that. We think that gives us sort of a great entry point towards offering advisory services to customers. Second, becoming the best place for advanced customers. So this is our customers that trade a little bit more actively, use options, engage in equities trading. We've made a lot of progress this year and we're working even harder to deliver innovative new functionality for our more advanced customers. And then the third international, so we recently launched Robinhood Wallet, we're also working aggressively this year to bring brokerage services internationally. And we're excited to welcome JB who will be leading the efforts to take our brokerage internationally. Sure. Happy to field that one. So there's really two questions there. First of all, for our U.S. customers, we're very focused on expanding selection and being the best place for you to invest in trade. In terms of access to foreign securities, customers can trade ADRs today via our platform commission free, and that gives investors exposure to foreign traded stocks. The second thing, expanding our operations internationally so that customers based in other countries can access Robinhood services. A huge part of our mission, we think that we've done a lot of great work to open up access and to make investing more accessible to people in the U.S. U.S. is comparatively a mature market where access is pretty good relative to some parts of the world. So we think it's a natural extension of our mission and a great business opportunity to take our technology and make it available overseas. I talked about Robinhood Wallet, which is available globally and will allow customers all over the world to self-custody, have control over their crypto and trade and swap with no network fees. On the brokerage side, we're being more aggressive and set a goal to start brokerage operations in the UK this year. So look out for that. We're very, very excited to make Robinhood available all over the world. Yes, sure. Thank you, G. Part of the mission of democratizing finance for all is giving access to the best information whenever and wherever customers need it. So we've been speaking to the folks over at Twitter for a while and heard about what they were doing with the stock pages and crypto pages on their platform. And we got excited to create an investing experience that gives value to their customers and makes it easier at a deep link to the Robinhood app. So you'll see us experimenting with more things like this over time. As of now, we don't have any plans to expand or form an official partnership with Twitter. Sure, I'll field this one. The first thing to note here is, as you've seen through the quarterly results and the progress we've made in diversifying our business, we've got a diversified business and are continuing to grow. And we feel like we're incredibly well positioned. In terms of payment for order flow and the SEC market structure proposals, we think investors have it great right now. The all in costs of investing, the accessibility, the tools and functionality have never been better. And we're worried that these proposals have the potential to give investors worse execution quality and higher prices in many instances. And these are really complex proposals. It'll take a long time to work through them. Ultimately we think they are unlikely to pass in their current form. So we're going to keep working with the SEC, including our comment letter coming soon and make sure customers continue to receive the best deal and have access to equities trading and make sure we're continuing to advocate for what we think is right for our customers. We actually are already a member of NASDAQ. We have a connection there, and a portion of customer orders are routed there. The way that we think about execution quality and routing orders is the routing is based on execution quality. That's really the deciding factor. So we aim to send customer orders where they're getting the best execution quality. And we actually publish execution quality statistics on our website and are very proud of it. Thanks, G. So we think serving our advanced customers is incredibly important. As I outlined a bit earlier, it's one of the top three things we're working on this year. We made a lot of progress last year really improving the experience for them, and we spent a lot of time talking to our advanced customers. And what we're hearing is they stay with Robinhood and they love Robinhood because we make things simple and are easy to use. And they actually love the flexibility to be able to see a very simple overview of their portfolio and their holdings and be able to trade simply along with the flexibility to dive into things like advanced charts and tools and features when they need to. So right now we think we can deliver on an awesome experience for advanced customers within the existing Robinhood app. And so we're not necessarily going to be creating a separate app, but we're focused on making Robinhood the best tool for our advanced customers. Hi, Devin. Yes. The only thing I would add is last year was in terms of products, one of the best years we've had. We've rolled out lots of new products to customers. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, to have two of our recent products in a relatively short amount of time get to double-digit millions in ARR in a year like 2022, we're incredibly proud of. So Stock Lending, as we mentioned, getting to a $30 million run rate, instant withdrawals within a couple of months of launch, getting to $20 million. So we have new businesses that we were able to roll out and I think this year we're in a great position to keep investing and be aggressive. Yes, you probably saw we recently launched a Robinhood Wallet, which really gives the power and utility of self-custody to customers. And we're continuing throughout the year to make improvements to our core Robinhood crypto offering as well. Thanks Devin. Yes, you're right, Will, that we feel very confident in our ability to roll out products and sort of independently build new features that serve our customers. That said, it's not lost upon us that we have a large balance sheet. And the environment now is going to create some opportunities. So we have done M&A in the past. We're very deliberate about the opportunities that we're considering. We consider things like acceleration of our road map, team quality and fit. And we're proud of the M&A that we've done thus far. Jason mentioned Say Technologies. I think that team has integrated very well and is driving considerable business impact in terms of revenue to Robinhood. So I think we've had a good deliberate approach, and we do see opportunities with our balance sheet going forward. Thanks Will. Thank you. Yes. The only thing that I would add is, like we said, with stock lending post-launch, we made a ton of improvements to the product and the funnel, and we're really proud of the work that we continue to do there. With the Cash Card, it's the same story. We've got a great team on it. The road map is full. There's a lot of exciting things coming. So we're very excited about how much that product will improve in the near future. Well, one of the things we've been really looking at is the Net Promoter Score, the retention characteristics of our options product. And we've made a lot of improvements in the past year. At the beginning of 2022, the more advanced customers, the ones that we're engaging in options a little bit more, were on average less happy with our service than the typical customer and then we were able to reverse that quite aggressively in a relatively short amount of time. And that's through things like options and cash accounts; better customer support, including 24/7 live chat, which launched a couple of months ago; advanced charts; and more tools there. And we continue to rollout awesome, innovative options features with a lot more coming this year. So really, the options team has been firing on all cylinders. We're really happy with kind of our relative market share, especially in the light of overall sort of decline in volumes industry-wide. And I think there's a lot more to do. But a lot of it comes down to just us relentlessly improving the product. And I'm very proud of the work the team has done there. Thanks for the question. I'll field that one. I don't want to let the cat out of the bag too early. I think we've got some really exciting things in store. Certainly, we're looking at new assets and new features. And JB and Steve Quirk, awesome teams. They're putting a great team together. They care a lot about advanced customers. They've really done wonderful things in the past with thinkorswim and TD, which really innovated for advanced customers. And I think we've got another year we can go here at Robinhood, so stay tuned. I think index options are interesting. Again, I shouldn't comment on any specific assets, but we're certainly looking at everything. Yes. Happy to field that. So the Robinhood Wallet is global by default. It's a self-custodial Web 3 Wallet that offers trading and swapping with no network fees. So that we're very excited about. A separate app from the main Robinhood app, which offers brokerage services. And the goal for this year will be getting brokerage services live in the UK by the end of the year. Thanks, Ben. Yes. On the wallet side, I think the core functionality is in place, and we're getting great feedback from customers. There are a bunch of things that we're looking to add to make it even better. And the road map for that team is pretty full, and they've been executing pretty relentlessly. So kudos to the wallet team for that. And then \u2013 I'm sorry, you had a question about international beyond that... Marketing? Yes. It's really early for us. Of course, we're open to doing marketing in the future. But right now, we're focused on rolling out the product and getting as much feedback from the users on the wait list as possible. Yes. It's mainly just making sure the technology is in really good shape, and we adhere to all the different requirements for the UK market, making the experience seamless with the Forex money conversions and things like that and talking to customers and making sure that we do any UK-specific adaptations that we think will make the product as useful as possible for them. But we think we have a great foundation. We've made really big improvements in our infrastructure and technology over the past couple of years. So scaling, we don't anticipate it will be a problem. It's more about just getting the user experience and getting everything set up there. Thank you, everyone. Really appreciate the questions, and we will see you all next quarter, some of you sooner."

            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. In the fourth quarter, we stayed focused on serving customers, growing our business and driving long-term shareholder value. Our team continued to deliver on our product road map, and we generated positive adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter in a row. I'm proud of what we accomplished last year and look forward to 2023. Before I discuss our Q4 results, I want to provide context around the error that Vlad mentioned. Each quarter, we process hundreds of corporate actions as part of our day-to-day operations. In December, we received notification of a corporate action that was irregular, both in its timing and format and unfortunately got through our controls. Cosmos Health Inc., a NASDAQ-listed company, affected a one for 25 reverse stock split on December 16. A processing error caused us to sell shares short into the market. And although it was detected quickly, it resulted in a loss of $57 million as we bought back these shares against a rising stock price. While this event was an outlier, as Vlad said, we're taking it very seriously and have made the necessary changes to do everything we can to ensure this won't happen again. With that, let's look at the fourth quarter, starting with business results. We continue to add new customers, growing net funded accounts to 23 million, up about 50,000 from Q3. We're off to a good start in Q1 as well by adding about 60,000 accounts in January. I'd also note that we only include unique users in our net funded account definition, so this metric doesn't benefit from existing customers opening retirement accounts. So we're working on additional disclosure to show how many of our products customers are using. For monthly active users, they were 11.4 million, down 800,000 from Q3, though MAUs increased back to roughly 12 million in January. I'd also note that the vast majority of our customers continue to engage over time even if they aren't active every month. For example, if we look at the last three months of 2022, over 16 million unique customers were active. And if we look over the last six months, that figure grows to over 20 million customers. Turning to assets under custody. While they were $62 billion in Q4, down about 4% from last quarter, they rebounded to $75 billion in January as growth stocks and crypto recovered. Looking at net deposits, they were $4.8 billion in Q4, which translates to a 30% annualized growth for the quarter and brings the full year rate to 19%. We're encouraged by the resiliency of customer net deposits, which positions us really well for growth as markets rise over time. Now let's look at Q4 financial results. We grew adjusted EBITDA to $82 million, which was up $35 million from last quarter. This brought our adjusted EBITDA margin to 22% in Q4, which is up nine points from Q3. Going forward, we remain focused on delivering positive adjusted EBITDA and a driving attractive margins over time. Looking at our GAAP results. Q4 EPS was negative $0.19, an improvement of $0.01 from Q3. This included a combined negative $0.08 impact from the processing error and an impairment charge on Ziglu. Q4 EPS prior to these impacts was negative $0.11. Now let's review our Q4 revenues. Total net revenues were $380 million, a 5% increase from Q3. This was primarily driven by higher net interest revenues, partially offset by lower transaction revenues. Q4 ARPU was $66, up from $63 last quarter. Next, transaction-based revenues were $186 million in Q4, down 11% sequentially, primarily due to lower equity and crypto notional volumes. In January, we saw equity, option and crypto volumes, all roughly in line with Q4 averages. Moving to net interest revenues. They reached a new high of $167 million in Q4, up 30% from Q3. The increase was primarily driven by higher short-term interest rates and 12% growth in interest-earning assets. These factors were partially offset by lower margin balances and securities lending activity given the macro environment. Looking ahead to Q1, we are encouraged by what looks like likely to be another quarter of net interest revenue growth. As we consider what we see today for the forward Fed curve, customer balances and deposit rates as well as some pickup in securities lending activity, we anticipate Q1 net interest revenues will be up by roughly $20 million from Q4. Additionally, as we now appear to be in the later stages of the Fed rate hiking cycle, I wanted to note that we're exploring strategies to reduce our interest rate sensitivity, and we'll keep you updated when we have more to share on this. Moving on to other revenues. They were $27 million in Q4, up 8% from Q3. Gold subscribers increased by about 50,000 sequentially, and we plan to keep investing so that more of our customers find value in becoming a gold member. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect other revenues to be similar to Q4 levels. Looking a little further ahead, Q2 is proxy season, which drives a seasonal increase in revenue. And late last year, we transferred our proxy services from a third party to our Say Technologies team. So in Q2, we expect to see a sequential increase of about $30 million from Q1 levels. Now let's look at Q4 expenses. Prior to SBC, the processing error and some minor carryover from our Q3 restructuring, OpEx was $319 million, which brought our full year total to $1.55 billion. These 2022 results were an 18% improvement versus the prior year as we moved to a leaner cost structure. Looking forward to 2023, we're planning to improve our costs by another 7% on average as we plan to keep our cost lean, while investing for future growth. Our outlook for 2023 OpEx prior to SBC is a range of $1.42 billion to $1.48 billion. I'd note that on a quarterly basis, this outlook is about the same as the Q4 2022 range we provided last quarter, as I think this is a good zone to operate our business this year. Turning to SBC, it was $160 million in Q4, which brings our full year total to $654 million. Looking ahead, Vlad and Baiju's decision to cancel their 2021 pre-IPO market-based awards significantly lowers our outlook for the back half of this year. Under accounting rules, we will record a Q1 non-cash charge of about $485 million for the full acceleration of the canceled awards. We also expect SBC this year, excluding the charge will be in a range of $470 million to $550 million, which is a 22% improvement on average from last year. Including the charge, our full year 2023 SBC outlook is a range of $955 million to $1.035 billion. For Q1, we expect SBC of $615 million to $645 million mostly from the accounting charge. Given our progress on costs over the past year and improved SBC outlook, we now expect to get much closer to positive GAAP net income in the back half of this year. Beyond that, we think it's a little early to predict a specific timeline for reaching GAAP profitability as our revenues vary with the market backdrop. That said, we're focused on getting there by keeping our costs lean and scrappy to drive operating leverage as our business grows, while staying flexible to invest for the long-term. Now to capital management. I want to touch on a couple areas, first, on the Ziglu deal. After careful consideration, Robinhood terminated the deal and we booked a $12 million charge in Q4. Second, as Vlad mentioned, our Board authorized us subject to final approval to purchase our shares that Emergent Fidelity Technologies bought in May of last year. We're confident in the future of our business, so we think it would be a smart use of our excess corporate cash to buy most or all of the roughly 55 million shares, while continuing to have a strong balance sheet to invest for growth. In closing, I'm really pleased with all that we accomplished in 2022, delivering on our product roadmap, moving to a lean and scrappy cost structure, and ending the year with two straight quarters of adjusted EBITDA profitability. As we look ahead, we see a large opportunity to grow shareholder value from here. And with that, Chris, let's move to Q&A. Thanks. We already work with TurboTax. And in fact customers get a $15 discount if they upload to TurboTax. We've been making a number of changes to the tax experience for customers. This year, we consolidated the tax form for customers who are trading both equities and crypto. So they receive a single tax form from Robinhood this year, which makes it a lot more convenient. And also we're sending in a form that makes it really easy for customers to upload their data to the tax software of their choice. And then also we've already sent well ahead of the deadline millions of these forms out to customers and should have the remaining ones out really soon. So we're making a lot of progress for customers on the tax front and proud of the team for doing that. Thanks, Devin. This is Jason. I'll take it. And then Vlad can add in if he has additional color. We think there's a lot of leverage that we can achieve as we grow our business over time. We're going to continue to manage our cost to stay lean. That said, we'll have some flexibility to lean in a little bit more on investments that we think are the right ones to make. But the guidance that we've given incorporates the investments that we're planning for the things that we've talked about and have in our plan for this year. So we feel really good about the range that we've given on OpEx given our growth plans. So Devin, we have seen a pickup in the first part of the year to levels that are kind of on par with the average for Q4. So I'd say it was a bit of a step on the sideline, watch a little bit, particularly in the month of December. But we're definitely encouraged with what we're seeing in the first part of the year and really into February. We continue to think that crypto is here to stay, and we're continuing to invest in this space and are really optimistic. Yes. Well, it's a great question. Look, it's not lost on us that net interest revenue is a rising and important part of our mix, and it's something that we're paying really close attention to. It's a little early to talk about the specific strategies that we're looking at. But really just wanted to signal to shareholders that it's something that we're paying attention to, and we look forward to implementing some strategies that will decrease the sensitivity that we have there. So we'll update you over time. But unfortunately, I probably shouldn't get too far into the details I'd be getting ahead of myself. Yes. So the first part of your question is just what kind of levers we have on cost. 2022 marked a big shift towards getting lean and being productive. I think there's more opportunity there. I wouldn't say that there's the kind of opportunity that we were able to realize in 2022. But you should expect us to continue to find ways to be more efficient across the company and serve our customers great even while being super-efficient. We're feeling really good at the level that we're at. We think it's a good level to operate in 2023. But that said, there's always ways to be more efficient. And I know the finance team, the engineering team and others across the company are constantly looking for ways to optimize our costs. And so I wouldn't say we're as low as we could possibly be right now. And certainly, about a third of the increase in our kind of run rate costs into 2023 are about pursuing new growth initiatives and growing the business, which I think kind of takes us into the second part of your question is what are we doing to drive growth? And you heard Vlad talk about all the initiatives that we rolled out last year and highlight a few of them that are starting to get some traction on a revenue basis. We want to build a portfolio of businesses and services over time that can each in its own right become like nine-figure and growing revenue contributions. Some of them will get going faster than others, but it's a long-term effort for us. And we're going to keep investing and keep planting seeds, including just by improving the experience that we're offering on our existing businesses. If you take fully paid securities lending, for example, when we initially rolled that out, we had \u2013 in the first few months, we had an ARR run rate of about $15 million. And that's great. That's a great way to kind of get started on a new business. But the team didn't stop. They kept iterating. They kept finding ways to get more people to adopt, to get more efficient and better tools in the hands of our trading desk. And now we're running at a $30 million ARR. And there's a direct line between all the work and all the iteration that's been going on since launch. And so you're going to see us launch products, you're going to see us iterate on those products and just keep driving for improvement. And I think when you add all that together, it leads to revenue growth over time. Yes. Thanks for your question. No, it doesn't incorporate any anticipated repurchase of those Emergent Fidelity Technology shares. So a good clarification there. And in terms of kind of ongoing repurchases at this point, we're just focused on buying the shares that we had talked about and we'll save for later. As we think about capital management, we really want to be investing in the business for growth, having flexibility to complement that organic growth through M&A and then kind of as a third option in priority order would be thinking about returning value to shareholders through things like repurchases. So nothing to announce there and nothing to signal either. Thank you. Good evening. Yes. So in terms of the margin book, we have seen it move up. I wouldn't say it was a big move up in January, but it has moved up slightly from the levels that we saw right at the end of the year. In terms of the take rate on equity PFOF, nothing has changed structurally there. It moves with kind of the mix of what our customers are buying and selling as well as the level of spreads on the things that they're buying and selling. So that's probably all the color really I have on the take rate. Yes. So what we said for next quarter is that we think interest revenues will move up about $20 million versus what we saw in Q4. We're providing a schedule in our investor presentation that kind of lays out the $18 billion of interest-earning assets. What you expect is when those rates come that a good majority of that should flow through against those interest-earning assets, offset by anything that we pass along to our customers. And in that regard, we look primarily at the gold cash sweep. And our rate right now is 4.15. So the take rate there relative to the Fed funds effective is roughly 50 basis points. We're giving over 400 basis points by comparison to our customers. So the vast majority of that is going to customers. And really, when we think about pricing on that, we just want to be at or near or kind of with the top of the market in comparable offerings, which we think we're doing a really good job and customers are seeing and reacting to. Hey Ken, so this is Jason. I'll take that, and Vlad can jump in with any additional color. So it's an opt-in rather than opt-out for the cash management customers that are moving over. And so far, we've seen kind of a slow uptake in the opt-in to the Cash Card. That's something that we're looking at. We're \u2013 I talked earlier in one of my responses to just iterating and improving our offering. And so we're talking to customers. We're working on optimizing the onboarding flow. And we hope to see even more customers choose to adopt the Cash Card. We're also looking at just the value proposition of the Cash Card. And over time, we'll continue to iterate on that until we get to a point that we think we've got really great product market fit. In terms of the update on the number of kind of card users, it's around 800,000. So it's up a couple of hundred thousand since the last time that we shared that with you. And then there's \u2013 of that 800,000, there's a minority of that, that are engaging more frequently is kind of top of wallet. And that also is something that we're looking at to make sure that we just get the value proposition right for customers and get it to where the green Robinhood card just moves up to the top of the stack in our customers' wallets. So well, it's early, and we'll continue to update you as we make progress there. And it's been, as you know, Ken, just a really challenging macro environment, not just for our customers, but for all market participants, frankly, over the last year or so. And that's one of the reasons why we're really excited about being able to offer over 4% yield on the gold, cash sweep program, introducing retirement, which is going to help customers just kind of systematically, dollar cost average over a long period of time to reach their goals. And so really, you're going to see Robinhood evolve its platform so that no matter how customers want to trade, Robinhood will be the place to do it. And so it's a long-term strategy for us, but we're making progress there. Thanks, Ken. Appreciate the question. Yes. So very, very modest headcount growth. We had a number of open positions at the end of the year. We're planning to fill those and then very, very modest incremental growth on top of that primarily for funding investments in growth. If you think about the run rate for Q4, excluding share-based compensation, that gets you to roughly $1.3 billion. And then our guidance was $1.42 billion to $1.48 billion for the year. So to unpack that a bit, there's really three categories of incremental growth versus the run rate from the fourth quarter. Each of them represent roughly a third, so a third, a third and a third for the following categories. The first is just kind of, first, you got to normalize Q4 spend for things like seasonality as well as we're assuming that we fully fund our company's bonus program in 2023, whereas we're paying much less than fully funded in 2022, given the macro environment and how the year went for us. And so you kind of \u2013 if you take seasonality and that bonus effect, that's roughly a third of the incremental off the Q4's run rate. The second is just existing business growth, continuing to deliver and improve on the existing products that we have. It includes things like merit increases for employee compensation that happens regularly on an annual basis. Pull-through of expenses that started kind of late in the year and you get the full year effect. And then the third category also, as I mentioned, roughly a thirdof the incremental is just investing for new business growth. And so that really bridges the baseline to the guidance. Thank you. I don't want to predict where the outperformance might come in the following quarter. Certainly, it's sensitive to the interest-earning assets that we carry. Movements in things like the margin book could definitely be a lever outperformance and the securities lending would be another area that, that might surprise. In Q4, we did outperform our expectations that owed mostly to just nice asset growth and a little bit better on deposit betas than we had forecast into the model. So this is Jason. We're hearing from our PR team that one of the news outlets is incorrectly reporting that Robinhood is affecting a split on our stock. I just want to be super clear that, that is not any plan that we have. It's not factually accurate. And so for all those listening, if you can spread the correct news, that would be fantastic. Thank you. Thanks, everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, everyone, and good day. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Robinhood Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. I would like to now hand the conference call over to Chris Kagal, our Vice President of Investor Relations. Go ahead.\nChris Koegel: Thank you, Haley. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Robinhood's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With us today are CEO and Founder, Vlad Tenev; and CFO, Jason Warrick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements about our financial outlook and our strategic and operational plans. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor are described in our press release issued today the related slide presentation on our Investor Relations website, our Form 10-Q filed August 30, 2022 and in other SEC filings.  Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investors.robinhood.com.  With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVladimir Tenev: Thanks for the intro, Chris, and thanks to everyone for joining. 6 months ago, we set an ambitious goal for us to return to adjusted EBITDA profitability by the end of the year, I'm proud to that we achieved this milestone a quarter ahead of schedule, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. In Q3, we had adjusted EBITDA of $47 million, in spite of a tough macro backdrop, we were able to simultaneously decrease cost, increase revenues and demonstrate diversification of our business model. We feel our cost structure is in a good place. So we're now fully focused on delivering great products and service for our customers and growing our business. I'll tell you more about our plans here.  But first, let's take a look at how our customers are doing. Amidst the challenging macro environment, customers continue to trust us with billions of dollars of net deposits each quarter as they invest through the cycle for the long term. Excluding those deposits, our customers' portfolios, on average, slightly outperformed the NASDAQ and S&P in Q3. These factors drove customer assets under custody, up by about 1% to $65 billion despite equity market values declining again this quarter. This environment highlights the importance of serving our customers' financial needs through the cycle and of diversifying our business beyond trading.  So let me tell you more about some of the products we're working on across brokerage, crypto and money. Starting with brokerage. Today's high interest rates can be challenging for customers with mortgages, student loans and car payments. At the same time, they present an opportunity for our customers to earn 1 of the highest yields available on their uninvested cash at levels not seen in over a decade. In September, we introduced a fantastic interest rate for our gold members, 3% on cash via our sweep program with no balance limits, none of the time commitments that CDs have and FDIC insurance of up to $1.5 million, 6x what you get from a typical bank account.  We're really excited about this product because it helps customers earn on their cash even when they're not investing. And so far, we like what we see with gold cash sweep balances up by over $1.5 billion since we raised rates. And following today's Fed rate hike, we'll raise the interest rate for gold customers even higher. This is just another 1 of the investments we're planning for the coming years to make Robinhood Gold the best deal in financial services.  We also want to provide great value for customers, investing for the long term at Robinhood, so we're excited to launch Robinhood Retirement, just in time for the New Year and the heart of IRA season. For our customers looking to open a new retirement account or roll over an existing IRA or taking their first steps in long-term investing. We're excited to share this product with you, and we know you'll love it.  Finally, I want to share some of the great work our brokerage team has been doing for our advanced customers. Recall, our advanced customers are customers who trade more actively and use more sophisticated products like options. We're 1 of the very few platforms that offer options trading with no contract fees. And this is incredibly valuable for customers who place a lot of option trades. In case you don't know about this, most companies charge something like a $0.65 per contract fee for each option trade. And that's in addition to payment for order flow at about the same levels we generate. And while that may not sound like a lot of money, not paying those fees saved our customers over $600 million in the past year. We love saving money for our customers like this and think customers of a lot of other firms are paying way too much to trade options.  Now at the start of the year, our advanced customers were, on average, less satisfied with our service than our other customers. So we listen to their feedback and double down on building products designed for them, starting with hyper extended trading hours and stock lending. We kept hearing they wanted more trading data, tools and analytics in the app. So in August, we rolled out advanced charts. We built these natively to give advanced customers quick, simple, customizable and in-depth analysis that they want for trading without cluttering the user interface.  Additionally, while churn is at the lowest level in years, a leading driver of advanced customer churn was not being able to trade options in cash accounts. So we are pleased to roll out this feature in July. And in the past 6 months, we've seen a flip where advanced customers now have higher satisfaction with the Robinhood experience than our other customers. Of course, there's always more to do, and we're continuing to invest to make Robinhood a fantastic platform for everyone.  Now let's move to crypto. We want everyone to have safe, easy and low-cost access to the power of the decentralized web, which we believe is the future operating system of financial services. So after building a wait list of more than 1 million people since May, we're excited that we rolled out the beta of the Robinhood Wallet, our self-custody Web 3 wallet to the first 10,000 customers last month. While it's early, we're hearing from customers that they love the simple and intuitive mobile experience and they really love the no gas fees. They also tell us that they'd like us to add more blockchains to increase the breadth of coins available for them to swap and trade. We're encouraged to see this enthusiastic early response and we'll keep enhancing the wallet. And we're planning to roll the Robinhood wallet out internationally. So we're excited that this will be our first product available to people all over the world.  We also continue to roll out more coins over the past quarter in a deliberate and considered manner. One of these was our first stable coin USDC from Circle. As part of this rollout, we're creating a new free educational program called Learn and Earn that gives our customers the ability to earn crypto simply by learning about it. We're excited to roll this out and give our customers even more reasons to engage with our awesome educational content.  Now let's talk about Robinhood Money, which includes our cash card as well as tools to move money in and out of Robinhood. While it's still early for our cash card, which launched in March, we have over 500,000 customers today. We're focused on continuing to improve the experience. So more customers use the Cash Card as the top card in their wallet. Looking ahead, we're excited to be introducing the new card to our 6 million legacy cash management customers soon, so they can also enjoy the enhanced benefits.  Another Robinhood staple that customers have loved for years, is our seamless instant deposits. And this is something that we continue to invest in, including giving gold customers the ability to make instant deposits of up to $50,000. We realized that some customers want to be able to withdraw their money instantly as well rather than weight up to 5 business days for traditional ACH transfers. So last month, we started rolling out instant withdrawals, providing customers with a new option to withdraw cash instantly to participating banks at a competitive 1.5% price point, while always maintaining the ability to use free ACH transfers. We think customers will really like the experience and pricing of our new expedited service as well as having expanded choice of money movement options. We're excited to roll this out more broadly, and we're going to keep you posted on our progress here.  Stepping back a bit, we've seen and managed through a lot of change in the past year, change in the economy, geopolitics, financial markets and change in Robinhood as well. We've gone from an environment of easy money to want to focus and constraint in the outside world and within Robinhood itself. And while it's been hard, I think this transformation has been incredibly positive for the company. Despite significantly trimming our headcount and expenses, we've seen our fastest product velocity and iteration speed and our service quality for customers is the best I've seen.  Our focus remains on building exceptional products that give ordinary people control over their financial lives and giving open access to tools once reserved for the rich. I'm lucky to be working with such a talented team. And I again wanted to congratulate them for driving us to adjusted EBITDA profitability 1 quarter ahead of schedule.  With that, let me turn it over to Jason.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. In the third quarter, we stayed focused on serving customers, growing our business and driving long-term shareholder value. In spite of the macro environment, our team continued to deliver on our 2022 road map, which helped maintain steady net funded accounts and drive strong net deposits. And as Vlad mentioned, we generated positive adjusted EBITDA in Q3 by continuing to increase revenues and lower costs. I'm pleased by the progress we've made through the first 3 quarters.  Let's look at the third quarter, starting with business results. Net funded accounts were 22.9 million, up about 60,000 from Q2. We Monthly active users were 12.2 million, down 1.8 million from Q2. Despite the difficult environment, we're encouraged by our continued industry-leading engagement and low churn through another volatile quarter. We've also seen net funded accounts continue to tick up in October and MAUs increased to 12.5 million.  Turning to assets under custody. They were $65 billion, up about 1% from last quarter. AUC grew as strong net deposits more than offset the impact of lower market valuations. In October, we saw AUC move back up to about $70 billion. Looking more closely at net deposits, they were $2.7 billion in Q3, which translates to a 17% annualized growth rate. We've continued to see net deposit strength in October with customers contributing over $1.5 billion in the month. This is encouraging for long-term asset growth as the combination of strong net deposits in rising markets can drive meaningful asset growth over time.  Now let's look at Q3 financial results. Adjusted EBITDA was positive $47 million. This improved by $127 million from Q2 and over $190 million from Q1, and our adjusted EBITDA margin increased more than 60 points over the past 2 quarters. These improvements were driven by higher revenues and lower costs that drove operating leverage. While delivering positive adjusted EBITDA this quarter was an important milestone, I'd emphasize that we're early in our journey to drive higher profits over time.  Now let's review our Q3 revenues. Total net revenues were $361 million, a 14% increase from Q2. This was primarily driven by higher net interest in transaction revenues, partially offset by seasonally lower other revenues. Q3 ARPU was $63, up from $56 last quarter.  Now moving to transaction-based revenues. They were $208 million, up 3% sequentially. Notional volumes increased in equities and options but decreased in crypto. For October, we saw trading levels across the 3 categories roughly in line with September. Looking at net interest revenues, which is a growing part of our revenue mix, it reached a new high of $128 million in Q3, up over 70% from Q2 and driving over 35% of total revenue as the Fed continued to increase rates.  I'd like to highlight a couple of things. First, interest-earning assets were up to over $17 billion as of the end of last week, driven by growth in our cash sweep balances, partially offset by strong customer net buying into the market. As of the end of last week, our cash sweep balances were up to $3.7 billion, including $2.4 billion in gold. One of the things that's really exciting is the majority of the increases in gold suite balances are from new deposits with the rest largely coming from upgrades to gold. Second, our fully paid securities lending program, which just launched in May is off to a good start. It generated about $4 million of revenue in Q3, already reaching 15% of revenues from our margin securities lending.  Looking ahead to Q4, we're encouraged by what looks likely to be another quarter of net interest revenue growth. As we consider what we see today for the forward Fed curve, customer balances and deposit rates,as well as a decrease in our margin book and securities lending so far in the quarter, we anticipate Q4 net interest revenues will be up by roughly $25 million from Q3. We could certainly come in higher or lower than that level, so we'll have to see how Q4 plays out.  Also, I'd like to note that we've added customers cash sweep balances to our monthly metrics for Q3 and going forward. This should help give additional insight into how our net interest revenues are trending as we move through each quarter. Moving on to other revenues. They were $25 million, down $17 million from Q2, primarily due to the seasonal decrease in proxy-related revenues. The largest driver of these revenues are gold subscribers, which finished Q3 at $1.1 million. We're really excited to be investing in our gold program with our high-yield offer of 3% on customer sweeps driving strong net deposits. We like this early signal, and we're looking forward to finding more ways to add value to the gold program.  Now let's look at expenses, starting with OpEx prior to share-based compensation. They were $425 million in Q3, which includes $90 million of restructuring charges. If we look at OpEx prior to SBC and restructuring, they were $335 million, which was an improvement of over $90 million versus Q2. Progress was primarily driven by reductions in workforce and third-party labor and improvements in several other cost categories, including technology infrastructure. Given our progress, we expect Q4 OpEx prior to SBC to be in the range of $350 million to $370 million, which includes planned increases in marketing. I'd note that this Q4 level is roughly $100 million below where we started the year, reflecting the progress we've made getting to a leaner operating position.  Turning to share-based compensation. It was $110 million, which is net a of $53 million reversal from our August workforce reduction. For Q4, we expect SBC will be in the range of $150 million to $190 million. As for dilution, I'd like to share a couple of updates here. First, we're adding new disclosure to our quarterly earnings presentation for our diluted share count, which is up by a little more than 4% through the first 3 quarters of this year. For year-end, we expect diluted shares to be in the same zone as Q3. Second, looking to next year, we're planning for our diluted share count to grow by 4% or less, assuming no change in our stock price from today's level.  Now to capital management. I want to share an update on our Ziglu acquisition. While the parties are working hard at it, there's some regulatory uncertainty as to whether the deal will close. What we know at this point is that the deal won't close this quarter. I'd emphasize that we like several pathways to international expansion, including launching our Robinhood Wallet globally early next year. So we remain excited about the opportunity to serve customers around the world over time. In the current environment, it also remains important for us to have a strong balance sheet and cash position. That's why we like our position with no debt, over $6 billion of corporate cash and improvements in our cost structure. This combination provides strength, flexibility and financial runway to continue serving our customers, execute on our product road map and evaluate potential acquisitions. As I mentioned last quarter, we have roughly $2.5 billion of excess cash above our risk scenarios. In closing, I'm really pleased with the progress in Q3 and optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us to deliver value for customers and shareholders.  With that, Chris, let's move to Q&A.\nA - Chris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Jason. Leading into this quarter's Q&A session, we'll start by answering about a dozen questions of the questions from shareholders from say Technologies ranked by number of votes. We'll pass over any questions that were already answered on the call, in group together questions that share a common theme. After that, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So I'll kick it off with 1 of our top questions from say technologies. I'm going to pair together 2 questions. The first is from [indiscernible] who asks, will retirement accounts be offered this year? And also another from [indiscernible] asks, are there any plans to add Roth RIA accounts to Robinhoo.\nVladimir Tenev: I'll field that one. The short answer is yes to both. So we're excited to roll out retirement just in time for the tax season. The team has been working hard at it. I think you'll really like what the product is going to look like and the value prop for customers. And we're polishing it and making sure that it looks great. But we feel good about rolling it out just in time for the tax season.\nChris Koegel: Great. And will that include Roth IRA's as well, Vlad?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes, it will. So we'll have additional context as we get closer, but we think people are really going to like it.\nChris Koegel: Terrific. All right. The next question also on product. Are there any -- Brian ii, are there any plans to add bonds to available investments?\nVladimir Tenev: Thanks, Brian. While we don't have near-term plans to offer bonds. We do have a lot of solutions for customers that want exposure to fixed income products. So of course, we already offer bond ETFs. And as I mentioned in the call, we have a very competitive offering for gold customers where we pay them interest on their uninvested cash. So that rate has been 3% since the last Fed rate hike and will actually increase even further after today's Fed rate hike.  In terms of bonds and adding more instruments to Robinhood, we haven't been hearing a lot of customers requesting those specifically. That said, we understand that with retirement and as we continue to add more tools for long-term investors who are diversifying, we might begin to see more feedback about that. So we're obviously always listening to customers and we're able and excited to add the products that they care about most. So we're going to continue to keep an eye on that.\nChris Koegel: All right. One more product question from John who asks, are there any plans to launch a credit card at Robinhood?\nVladimir Tenev: For credit cards, we don't have any near-term plans here. But today, we offer a debit card with rewards and merchant incentives, and also 2-day early pay if you direct deposit your paycheck. So this was introduced with the launch of the Robinhood Cash Card earlier this year. So we recognize customers may want access to credit, particularly in this environment. So we're going to be looking at that, but no immediate near-term plans for credit cards.\nChris Koegel: Okay. Thanks, Vlad. The next question is a capital question, so probably for you, Jason. So Erfan asks, are you planning to give dividends in the future?\nJason Warnick: We don't think giving dividends is the best use of our capital right now. We're focused on using our cash to drive growth through product development and international expansion. We also like the flexibility to grow via acquisitions. But over time, we'll continue to evaluate whether returning to cash to shareholders is the right move. But again, right now, it's -- we're focused on growth as a higher priority.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Jason. Another question from Brian, who asks, when will we see a return of IPO access?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes, I'll field this one. So in terms of IPOs that we offer on the Robinhood platform. We have some selection criteria. And the fact of the matter is this has been a really slow year for IPOs that would be big enough in terms of market cap to feature to our customer base. So understanding that this is cyclical as soon as the IPO market turns around and we see more IPOs that meet those criteria, we're going to be hard at work to bring those to our customers so that they can participate.\nChris Koegel: Great. To ask a couple of questions in a 2-parter. Let's take those separately. So -- and [indiscernible] he asks, when will Robinhood go global?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes, I'll take that one. Thank you for the question, [indiscernible]. The short answer is next year. So we plan to roll out the Robinhood Wallet internationally. So that will be available internationally or early next year. And this will actually be our first product available to customers all over the world. And as Jason mentioned, there is some regulatory uncertainty that we continue to work on our Ziglu acquisition.\nChris Koegel: All right. And [indiscernible] also asks, when do you think Robinhood might regain its IPO valuation?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes. Thanks, Atanu. So as we think about shareholder value, we recognize that the stock performance as well as the overall market has been hard for shareholders this year. And we're hard at work, adding value to our business. So let me tell you how we're thinking about this. First, we're very focused on our cost structure. And as you guys have seen, we've made a lot of progress here in the last couple of quarters, and it's going to be important for us to manage the as we grow from here. Second, we've got a lot of improvements that we've made to existing products. We've introduced new products. And we have really tremendous progress here as well.  As I mentioned earlier in the call, the product velocity, the improvements in service quality and product quality for our existing products has been some of the best that I've seen since starting Robinhood. And I expect that to continue. And we're going to be focused and constrained, and we're probably not going to be able to get to as many things as if the market was doing a little bit better. But I think the things that we do get to are going to be tremendous, and we're going to continue to have good velocity, and we think if we keep doing both of these things, if we keep improving the product quality of our existing products and rolling out really impactful new products, we're going to deliver a lot of shareholder value over time.\nChris Koegel: All right. Maybe the next 1 is for Jason. So John P. asks, can you talk about how rising interest rates affect the business and where you see the business benefit benefiting from [indiscernible]?\nJason Warnick: Sure. I can take this one. Our 2 biggest areas that we generate revenues are from trading activity on the 1 hand and interest revenues. With interest rates increasing, we've seen trading come down recently. But we have about $17 billion in assets that generate interest. So when rates increase, those assets generate more interest revenue for us. But it's not just us that benefits from rising interest rates. Customers also benefit. As Vlad was talking about today, we've increased the rate that gold members can earn on their cash. It's currently 3%, and we're really excited to increase that further now that the Fed increased rates further today.\nChris Koegel: All right. The next 1 is from Heckman P who asks, when will 24-hour trading be offered at Robinhood?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes, I'll field that one. This is something that I'm very excited about. So I mean, Robin Hood has really been about modernizing stock trading and bringing it into the 21st century from the time we got started. So we were the first to introduce the 0 commission model, we made it seamless to use on mobile. And 1 of the things that's particularly archaic right now is the fact that stock trading in U.S. equities, which is such a large and vibrant market is structured around East Coast working hours. So our goal is to modernize that and deliver 24/7 round-the-clock stock trading, making investing accessible whenever people want. . We think this is particularly going to be important as we start offering our services internationally. So at Robinhoo today, and this is as of earlier this year, people can trade for over half of the day. So starting at 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern. We're now beta testing even longer trading hours, which include 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. Eastern. So extending it by 3 hours in the early mornings. And so once that's launched, customers will be able to trade for 16 hours a day. And so you're continuing to see us make progress. And the goal is to get to 24/7 trading as soon as possible. So plenty of exciting work happening there.\nChris Koegel: Awesome. Thanks, Vlad. Okay. Next question, Marcus G. asks, the media has been dunking on Robinhood through various docs, podcasts, Reddit, et cetera. How do you plan on countering the negative opinions out there and bringing these people back into the fold?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes. Thank you for that, Marcus. So if you really look back, I think a lot of the negative sentiment that you're seeing goes back to the mean stock rally around January of 2021, so nearly 2 years ago. And at that point, we had to make a very difficult decision to take away the buy button on some stocks, and we didn't earn too many fans through that to put it mildly. And it's been hard work to regain trust. We've made a lot of progress.  I think a lot of it starts from improving the quality of the service, listening to customers, showing that we are a reputable and reliable and solid platform for them. And we've been measuring this actually. We've seen that we've made a lot of strides in customer Net Promoter Score. Every time we improve the service offering, we improve customer support, particularly when we added 24/7 live phone support and followed that up with chat, we see these measures pick up. So we made a lot of progress. But as they say, trust takes a while to build and rebuild and we're focused on the long term, and we believe that the work that we're doing to make our service better and particularly for advanced customers is starting to pay significant dividends for us. So I know it's a long answer, but we believe that in this case, as we continue to do the right thing, build exceptional products, the sort of like media and Reddit and social media recognition is going to follow that.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. One more question from Sajan P who asks, Robinhood has always spoken about being a safety first company, with wallets set to launch in 2023 and the addition of new coins. Can you talk about how Robinhood will keep its investors safe from similar phases of licensed like Celsius?\nVladimir Tenev: Sure, Sajan and thank you. It's great to see you asking good questions, earnings call after earnings call. So stepping back, the goal of Robinhood crypto, as we've stated, is to be the safest, most trusted and lowest cost on-ramp to the decentralized web. So I think this is a great example of building the trust that we were just talking about. We're very selective about the coins that we list on the platform. We have a rigorous coin listing framework, which we believe is best-in-class. We're also not engaged in crypto lending. We custody coins. And with the Robinhood wallet that we just introduced the 10,000 beta customers. We give customers the option to sell custody as well. And we're also in regular contact with the SEC about the crypto offering.  So you'll see us continue to take a deliberate approach, and we hope that customers understand and appreciate that we're moving carefully. And sometimes, that means moving a little bit slower than a lot of these other crypto companies. But again, we want to be extremely deliberate and to help protect customers and their money.\nChris Koegel: Okay. Let's do one last question. So Kala asks, where do you see Robinhood in 5 years?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes. This is a great question. So coming back to our mission, the mission of Robinhood is to democratize finance for all. And what that means to us is really building exceptional products that give ordinary people control over their financial lives and giving open access to tools that were previously available only to the wealthy. And so if you look out 5 years, what would we like Robinhood to do?  The first thing is we'd like Robinhood to be -- to serve our customers' entire portfolios and entire wallet. So we'd like you to find value and direct deposit in your paycheck into Robinhood and using Robinhood for all of your spending for you to use it for saving. Of course, all of the investing that we offer right now, but also long-term retirement and passive. So we want Robinhood to be the highest value and best user experience tool for you to manage all of your money.  The second thing is we want Robinhood to be the default choice for your first financial account. So that entails always being focused on the next generation of customers. We don't want to just be a millennial-focused company and grow with our customers because I think that's the recipe for eventually being irrelevant. So every every generation, we have to continue to adapt our offerings and be top of mind as our customers think about opening not just their first investing account, but also the first place they deposit their paycheck and the first account they used to the spend out of. And then also, we're going to be a global company.  So we think crypto is a big part of that, and we're excited to continue to invest there. We've been making a ton of investments in the past year despite it being crypto winter. And we want Robinhood to serve the entire world and offer low-cost, extremely simple and affordable and easy-to-use services to a much broader market. And if you look at it, the U.S. is actually fairly well served here. We've got lots of people around the world that can't even benefit from a functional financial system. So we think there's not just a big opportunity, but a big a big part of our mission is serving those customers overseas. So there's going to be a lot of work done to invest and innovate in crypto and to expand international as well.\nChris Koegel: All right. I think that's good for today's questions from say. Thank you, everyone, for your questions. We appreciate all the thoughtful engagement from our shareholders and customers. And now it's time to open up the line for analyst questions. Okay. I'll now ask Kelly to please open up the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Josh Beck from KMCM -- or KBCM.\nJosh Beck: Thank you for the question. I guess I really wanted to kind of just dig into the expense side of the equation. Obviously, you've made real strides and obviously, we're able to hit that EBITDA target ahead of schedule. As we look forward into next year, not really expecting guidance, but just qualitatively, how should we think about the baseline of Q4 as we kind of move forward?\nJason Warnick: Yes. Thanks, Josh. So it's Jason. I'll take that one. So we provided guidance in my remarks that in Q4, we'll take our OpEx, excluding share-based compensation to the range of $350 million to $370 million. I think, Paul, we don't have guidance yet. We're busy doing planning for next year. But qualitatively, what I'd tell you is that we like where we're at in terms of our cost structure. We think it's much leaner and more scrappy of a position than how we started 2022. And you should expect that we'll continue to carefully manage our cost base as we grow from here. We'll make the investments that we think are prudent for growth, but we're going to do it with a lean and scrappy mindset.\nJosh Beck: Okay. Very helpful. And then for a follow-up, maybe just a little bit of a product question. Certainly, the money product and the cash card updates were encouraging, I believe, 0.5 million customers already since the launch earlier in Q1. How do you think about a ceiling for where that could go? Obviously, it's encouraging to see that out of the gate. But I don't know if the survey work that you've done or pace of adoption. Just curious on how that could progress moving forward?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes. I'll take that one. So as I mentioned earlier, we're really excited about serving our customers' needs more broadly than investing. So we see the opportunity to actually evolve the cash card to be people's primary spending account. So we'd like our customers to direct deposit their paychecks. And we've started building things to make that process easier, like 2-day early pay and also the ability to auto invest your paycheck. And it's starting to see good adoption among our existing customers to the point where we have over 6 million customers on legacy cash management, and we feel really good about starting to move those customers over.  And I think at that point, the cash card will have exposure to a significant portion of our customer base. This is earning the right to be someone's paycheck direct deposit institution of choice is going to take time. We know that this is a new product for us. but we're very excited about the team and the strategy ahead for 2023. So I think you're going to like what you see out of the cash part.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: So first question, nice to see cash building again on the balance sheet. I think with all the hard work you've done on expenses. Jason, I know mentioned interest in M&A just given the pretty harsh reset we've seen valuations, I just love to get an update on how you're thinking about the M&A market today, where opportunities may be emerging? I know a number of companies are much further away from getting to profitability? And then just remind us on some of the priorities, whether that be deals that scale customers or add new adjacent capabilities?\nJason Warnick: Sure. I'll start, and we'll see if Vlad has anything to add. So we love our strong balance sheet position, $6 billion in cash. I think we're in a really good position to be looking at growth, not just through investments in new products organically, but also through M&A transactions. It's a variety of types of companies that we might look at, whether it's acquisitions that are focused at kind of rounding out our portfolio of licenses or technology, but then also just with the vision of democratizing finance for all and that being so much more broad than simply trading I think there's a number of ways that we could extend the product offerings that Robinhood offers to customers through M&A. So we've got a solid team. We're paying really close attention to the opportunities that are out there, but we're going to be diligent in the way that we deploy our capital.\nVladimir Tenev: Yes. I just -- I would say, we feel really good about our position. We've been very patient. And I think that patience has really sort of been very positive in this environment as we're continuing to see more and more opportunities out there of, in some cases, high-quality companies trading at prices that are sort of a fraction of what they were earlier this year.\nDevin Ryan: Yes. Okay. Great. Just a quick follow-up here, another kind of product-centric, but you talked a little bit about some of the enhancements to the gold offering and good to hear about some of the momentum there. The higher interest rate seems like you can add tangible value to that offering. So I guess, is the cash that you're seeing coming into that, is that from just existing customers seeing the value? Or is that actually driving new customer growth there? And then bigger picture around gold, what are some of the other areas that you're maybe seeing opportunities where you could enhance the gold value add?\nJason Warnick: Yes, I'll take the first part, for sure. So we're seeing a really nice uptick in deposits in the gold sweep accounts. And we're finding that the majority is from new deposits with the rest largely coming from upgrades to gold. So really exciting for us. It's encouraging to see the overall balance of our interest-earning assets increasing and that's even with some offsets with strong net buying into this market by our customers. . In terms of gold enhancements, I'll comment, but glad you can weigh in. I think that there's a lot of opportunities across the products that we offer today to make gold really appealing. Essentially, we'd like to have gold be the best deal in financial services. And I think whether you look at the Cash Card or crypto and other areas of our business, there's opportunity for us to invest here. stepping back, gold was a product a couple of years ago that we added a number of features to. We saw a lot of interest by customers at the time to join gold.  But frankly, over the last couple of years, we've had other priorities as we dealt with the super high growth that our business was experiencing. And we're changing that. We increased the sweep balance rate for gold members to 3%. We're going to take it even higher, and we're encouraged to find other ways to add to that value proposition.\nVladimir Tenev: Yes. The only thing I would add is that gold started out as a product intended for active customers primarily with value props like margin trading and higher instant deposits as well as Level 2 market data and sort of more advanced data. And the competitive interest on uninvested cash is kind of the first foray into making the product useful to people that aren't active investors. And I think as you see us continue to diversify our product suite and enter into other products. We're asking our teams to really keep in mind what what value we can make so that gold customers do get the best deal in financial services.  And so gold is kind of becoming a little bit more of our planning process as we roll out these new products. I think we see lots of opportunities where customers can get an even better deal or kind of transition their usage of Robinhood into more of like an all-you-can-eat model and get more simplicity from how they use their product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Repetto from Piper Sandler.\nRichard Repetto: So my question is on the stock-based comp. I guess it's mainly for Jason, but you significantly outperformed in -- I guess, in 3Q, you lowered your target by, I think, almost 20% by -- if you look at the midpoint of stock-based comp by $135 million. So I'm just trying to understand was the reversal bigger than expected? Or has there been any change -- and you do have stock-based comp going up a little bit in 4Q, but has there been any change in strategy or culture in regards to the stock-based comp? What sort of drove this whole performance, I guess?\nJason Warnick: Yes. I think there's a few things that go into share-based compensation. First is just the effect of awards that have been historically granted I made comments last quarter that about half of our share-based compensation last quarter was from the pre-IPO awards that were granted to founders that are significantly out of the money. You mentioned the workforce reduction that has an impact, but also just lower rate of hiring. When you -- when we've historically given share-based awards to new employees. Those are 4-year awards historically, and that can be very expensive as you're ramping up your workforce. And so slowing that way down has had a positive effect.  And then I would say that given what's happened in the stock market, we also look kind of offsetting that. We also look to make sure that we continue to retain our top talent. And so additional awards were necessary here in the back part of the year, which helps bridge why it's going up on a net basis, net of the reversals in Q3.\nRichard Repetto: Got it. That's very helpful. And then, Vlad, I guess I'm trying to tie a lot of things together here. Revenue looks like let's just assume trading is at a sort of trough level or a level that shouldn't change too much. You get NII come up, so you got more revenue coming you brought your expenses done. Now your positive adjusted EBITDA. And I guess the question is, with cash is strong with this? And -- do you -- what's the new adjusted EBITDA? You passed the breakeven point a quarter early, but what's the target going forward? Do you try to build cash? Or do you sort of get back into the investment mode a bit more to grow expenses? Or how are you viewing your adjusted EBITDA targets going forward?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes, maybe Jason can take this one, Rich, and I can add some color if needed.\nJason Warnick: Yes, sounds good. Rich, I think we like our OpEx position now. And like I said earlier to Josh's question, we're going to have a mindset of being lean and scrappy as we grow from here. But that doesn't mean that we're not going to make thoughtful investments and deliberate investments to drive to drive growth. We're in the middle right now of our 2023 planning. So I'm just not in a position to kind of talk about expense guidance for next year. But it's not a fun experience to bring down the costs the way that we've done. And so as we go forward, we're going to be very mindful to be deliberate in the way that we increase costs going forward. But there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us. We'll make appropriate investments from here.\nVladimir Tenev: Yes. And I would just say that the balance we aim to strike at kind of the beginning of the year when we set the adjusted EBITDA positive goal was to get our cost structure in a good place and to demonstrate that we can be a sustainable business in tough economic times. And then we actually know that we can do quite well when economic times and monetary policy is a little bit looser. And I think we're proud of the progress there. And we wanted to do that while also taking advantage of the environment where a lot of other companies are pulling back to accelerate our own momentum.  So as you've kind of seen, we've continued to improve the product offering dramatically. We've rolled out new products this year. And so we're happy about the balance and we're going to continue to invest to drive customer growth and revenues and shareholder value in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak: So, Jason, you're going to have to bear with me. This is going to be a mouthful, but I really do want to spend some time unpacking the NII guidance that you offered up just recognizing that the revenue upside from higher rates really shined through this quarter. It just makes the NII guidance a little bit tough to reconcile, feedback from others suggest I'm not alone. And I was just hoping to unpack some of the component pieces, recognizing earning assets per your earlier comments are actually trending higher in 4Q, even with the more competitive sweep offering, still, it's only a small proportion, less than 25% of your earning assets that have any sort of deposit beta attached. And the average Fed funds is going to be up north of 125 bps in 4Q just based on the hikes that have transpired thus far. So just trying to reconcile all those component pieces with the $25 million sequential increase, which just feels quite light?\nJason Warnick: Yes, I appreciate the question. And what I can tell you is that you start with roughly $16 billion, $17 billion of interest earning assets. Included in there is our margin book, and we've seen that come down a bit in October to below $4 billion. And so we're factoring in the variability of that as we think about guidance for the rest of this quarter. Additionally, in October, securities lending has been pretty soft. And so we're being pretty cautious there as well as we think about how the rest of the quarter will play out. And then, of course, with the Fed rate increase, while we'll enjoy increased rates on a large portion of our interest-earning assets, as you mentioned, we also intend to pass some value back to customers in the gold sweep product. So those are kind of the moving parts, and we think $25 million incremental. First of all, we're really pleased that it's growing and that overall net interest earning assets are growing as well.\nSteven Chubak: That's great. And just for my follow-up on the sec lending piece. You actually saw a really nice uptick in tech lending revenues, especially in light of what was a very challenging environment. based on what we've seen from others. Now that we're a few quarters into the fully paid sec lending program, I was hoping you could provide some sort of update on how you're thinking about sizing that future revenue opportunity confidence around your ability to deepen penetration with your existing client base?\nJason Warnick: Yes. So we continue to be really optimistic about the fully paid securities offering. We had $4 million of revenue this -- in Q3 from fully paid securities lending. And that's after just a handful of months of launching that product. We're already at 15% of the revenue that we're generating from margin sec lending, which has been around for several years. So it's still very early. It is a difficult market out there and it's evolving. But we have a lot of optimism that this could be a meaningful portion of our securities lending revenue over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Just a question on the adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter, 13%. Just curious how you think about that going forward from here. Is this low-teens margin profile sustainable? And how do you think about what the right margin profile is for Robinhood longer term?\nJason Warnick: Yes. It's Jason. I'll take that one. Looking over the long term, I don't see any structural reason why we wouldn't have margins that are kind of in line with what you see at others in the industry. It's going to vary depending on the period and as we roll out new products and how that affects our mix of business. But we'll manage our costs, we'll build for the future with new products. And over the long term, we think will drive pretty attractive margins for shareholders.\nMichael Cyprys: And then can you -- as a follow-up question, can you talk a little bit about customer acquisition costs, how your approach has been evolving? Maybe you can help quantify how much it's been costing and how you're thinking about allocating your budget there?\nJason Warnick: Yes. So we're increasing our spending in marketing in Q4. You might have seen us with some television ads that have recently started and we tried to signal that last quarter that we begin doing that. Historically, the vast majority of our customers have come to us through referrals and word of mouth. And that's driven really attractive tax and returns, and digital paid ads has also been an area that we focused on for marketing.  What we found in periods of relative high interest in investing that it really pays to kind of lean in to paid advertising. But in periods like we're in right now of lower interest in investing, we haven't found it to really make economic sense to lean in and spend more for growth. And so we've been cautious there, and it's something that we're going to watch carefully. But in the near term, what we're doing is really focusing on some brand-building advertising. And if you haven't seen it, check out our advertisements, we really like them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: My first 1 is on the Web 3 digital wallet launch. Sorry if I missed it, but when are you going to open up to more than the initial 10,000 on the wait list? And also, I think you characterized the waitlist as 1 million plus. Is it significantly larger than 1 million?\nVladimir Tenev: I think the number is actually public. So if you go to robinhood3.com, you should be able to get the real-time wait list figure. So yes, as I mentioned, we've rolled it out to 10,000. We're watching the feedback closely. We're going to be rolling out to more in the coming months. And we're getting some really, really good feedback from customers. We can tell that they really like the no gas fees. They like the user interface and the experience and they're giving us useful feedback on multi-chain and other things. So we're not in a hurry. We could roll it out faster if we wanted to, but we want to make sure that the product improves, it is really, really good when it's generally available. And we expect that to to happen early next year.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And then just as my follow-up, another 1 on the digital wallet. I'm curious what capabilities you're going to be offering for NFTs both in terms of viewing NFTs and connecting to NFT marketplaces? And do you see this as a potential big differentiator for your crypto offer?\nVladimir Tenev: We have been hearing from some of our crypto enthusiasts that they want at the very least to be able to view their NFTs in wallet. I think trading NFTs in app is a little bit complicated with the recent Apple guidance. So we're keeping an eye on that. But I think it's highly likely that we'll add the ability to view NFTs and for people to custody them.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish.\nBenjamin Budish: I kind of wanted to ask another follow-up on the digital wallet. I know you guys aren't giving any kind of forward guidance in terms of OpEx for next year. But can you maybe talk a little bit about the investment required to take that product internationally?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes. I mean, the great thing about the Robinhood Wallet is, we've got a very lean team working on it. Of course, there's the requisite kind of compliance and infrastructure you need, but it's essentially a software product. And so the nature of it being noncustodial and blockchain-based means that it's kind of international by default. And the experience is simple and very straightforward and kind of really targeted towards the value prop of great UX and gasless swapping of tokens. And so we've kind of built it with the idea of being international native from the beginning, which I think makes it much more straightforward.\nBenjamin Budish: Great. And maybe I'll kind of follow up just on the same topic. In terms of eventually launching a stock trading or options trading or anything else internationally. Do you think there's a lot of that investment is applicable in terms of what you have to do for -- to comply with KYC and AML regulations and the like? Is there a lot that will translate directly? Or is that going to be a separate sort of compliance and infrastructure build-out?\nVladimir Tenev: Yes. I think for the custody solution and the brokerage, so custodial crypto and brokerage, it's a little bit different. But certainly, there's value that we'll get from rolling out the noncustodial wallet internationally and from creating kind of a more simple and focused staff because it's very likely that in some jurisdictions, we'll be crypto first and others will be brokerage first. But we're not going to be able to -- we're unlikely to make all of the Robinhood U.S. features available in every jurisdiction, at least on the outset.\nJason Warnick: Before we end the call, I just want to finish by saying that we've made the decision to take our gold sweep interest rate to 3.75%. So we think that's just absolutely tremendous for customers, and we're excited to deliver that to them.\nVladimir Tenev: Yes. I think that's a great value in this environment. That's a hard rate to beat.\nOperator: Perfect. Well, I would like to thank you, everyone, for your questions. I would like to turn it back now to Vlad for closing remarks.\nVladimir Tenev: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining. As always, we've appreciated the questions. Congrats to the team again for a strong quarter and delivering adjusted EBITDA profitability a quarter ahead of schedule, and we're getting back to work. There's a lot more to do to deliver on democratizing finance for all. So thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. This does conclude our program. You may now disconnect from the call.",

            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. In the third quarter, we stayed focused on serving customers, growing our business and driving long-term shareholder value. In spite of the macro environment, our team continued to deliver on our 2022 road map, which helped maintain steady net funded accounts and drive strong net deposits. And as Vlad mentioned, we generated positive adjusted EBITDA in Q3 by continuing to increase revenues and lower costs. I'm pleased by the progress we've made through the first 3 quarters.  Let's look at the third quarter, starting with business results. Net funded accounts were 22.9 million, up about 60,000 from Q2. We Monthly active users were 12.2 million, down 1.8 million from Q2. Despite the difficult environment, we're encouraged by our continued industry-leading engagement and low churn through another volatile quarter. We've also seen net funded accounts continue to tick up in October and MAUs increased to 12.5 million.  Turning to assets under custody. They were $65 billion, up about 1% from last quarter. AUC grew as strong net deposits more than offset the impact of lower market valuations. In October, we saw AUC move back up to about $70 billion. Looking more closely at net deposits, they were $2.7 billion in Q3, which translates to a 17% annualized growth rate. We've continued to see net deposit strength in October with customers contributing over $1.5 billion in the month. This is encouraging for long-term asset growth as the combination of strong net deposits in rising markets can drive meaningful asset growth over time.  Now let's look at Q3 financial results. Adjusted EBITDA was positive $47 million. This improved by $127 million from Q2 and over $190 million from Q1, and our adjusted EBITDA margin increased more than 60 points over the past 2 quarters. These improvements were driven by higher revenues and lower costs that drove operating leverage. While delivering positive adjusted EBITDA this quarter was an important milestone, I'd emphasize that we're early in our journey to drive higher profits over time.  Now let's review our Q3 revenues. Total net revenues were $361 million, a 14% increase from Q2. This was primarily driven by higher net interest in transaction revenues, partially offset by seasonally lower other revenues. Q3 ARPU was $63, up from $56 last quarter.  Now moving to transaction-based revenues. They were $208 million, up 3% sequentially. Notional volumes increased in equities and options but decreased in crypto. For October, we saw trading levels across the 3 categories roughly in line with September. Looking at net interest revenues, which is a growing part of our revenue mix, it reached a new high of $128 million in Q3, up over 70% from Q2 and driving over 35% of total revenue as the Fed continued to increase rates.  I'd like to highlight a couple of things. First, interest-earning assets were up to over $17 billion as of the end of last week, driven by growth in our cash sweep balances, partially offset by strong customer net buying into the market. As of the end of last week, our cash sweep balances were up to $3.7 billion, including $2.4 billion in gold. One of the things that's really exciting is the majority of the increases in gold suite balances are from new deposits with the rest largely coming from upgrades to gold. Second, our fully paid securities lending program, which just launched in May is off to a good start. It generated about $4 million of revenue in Q3, already reaching 15% of revenues from our margin securities lending.  Looking ahead to Q4, we're encouraged by what looks likely to be another quarter of net interest revenue growth. As we consider what we see today for the forward Fed curve, customer balances and deposit rates,as well as a decrease in our margin book and securities lending so far in the quarter, we anticipate Q4 net interest revenues will be up by roughly $25 million from Q3. We could certainly come in higher or lower than that level, so we'll have to see how Q4 plays out.  Also, I'd like to note that we've added customers cash sweep balances to our monthly metrics for Q3 and going forward. This should help give additional insight into how our net interest revenues are trending as we move through each quarter. Moving on to other revenues. They were $25 million, down $17 million from Q2, primarily due to the seasonal decrease in proxy-related revenues. The largest driver of these revenues are gold subscribers, which finished Q3 at $1.1 million. We're really excited to be investing in our gold program with our high-yield offer of 3% on customer sweeps driving strong net deposits. We like this early signal, and we're looking forward to finding more ways to add value to the gold program.  Now let's look at expenses, starting with OpEx prior to share-based compensation. They were $425 million in Q3, which includes $90 million of restructuring charges. If we look at OpEx prior to SBC and restructuring, they were $335 million, which was an improvement of over $90 million versus Q2. Progress was primarily driven by reductions in workforce and third-party labor and improvements in several other cost categories, including technology infrastructure. Given our progress, we expect Q4 OpEx prior to SBC to be in the range of $350 million to $370 million, which includes planned increases in marketing. I'd note that this Q4 level is roughly $100 million below where we started the year, reflecting the progress we've made getting to a leaner operating position.  Turning to share-based compensation. It was $110 million, which is net a of $53 million reversal from our August workforce reduction. For Q4, we expect SBC will be in the range of $150 million to $190 million. As for dilution, I'd like to share a couple of updates here. First, we're adding new disclosure to our quarterly earnings presentation for our diluted share count, which is up by a little more than 4% through the first 3 quarters of this year. For year-end, we expect diluted shares to be in the same zone as Q3. Second, looking to next year, we're planning for our diluted share count to grow by 4% or less, assuming no change in our stock price from today's level.  Now to capital management. I want to share an update on our Ziglu acquisition. While the parties are working hard at it, there's some regulatory uncertainty as to whether the deal will close. What we know at this point is that the deal won't close this quarter. I'd emphasize that we like several pathways to international expansion, including launching our Robinhood Wallet globally early next year. So we remain excited about the opportunity to serve customers around the world over time. In the current environment, it also remains important for us to have a strong balance sheet and cash position. That's why we like our position with no debt, over $6 billion of corporate cash and improvements in our cost structure. This combination provides strength, flexibility and financial runway to continue serving our customers, execute on our product road map and evaluate potential acquisitions. As I mentioned last quarter, we have roughly $2.5 billion of excess cash above our risk scenarios. In closing, I'm really pleased with the progress in Q3 and optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us to deliver value for customers and shareholders.  With that, Chris, let's move to Q&A. We don't think giving dividends is the best use of our capital right now. We're focused on using our cash to drive growth through product development and international expansion. We also like the flexibility to grow via acquisitions. But over time, we'll continue to evaluate whether returning to cash to shareholders is the right move. But again, right now, it's -- we're focused on growth as a higher priority. Sure. I can take this one. Our 2 biggest areas that we generate revenues are from trading activity on the 1 hand and interest revenues. With interest rates increasing, we've seen trading come down recently. But we have about $17 billion in assets that generate interest. So when rates increase, those assets generate more interest revenue for us. But it's not just us that benefits from rising interest rates. Customers also benefit. As Vlad was talking about today, we've increased the rate that gold members can earn on their cash. It's currently 3%, and we're really excited to increase that further now that the Fed increased rates further today. Yes. Thanks, Josh. So it's Jason. I'll take that one. So we provided guidance in my remarks that in Q4, we'll take our OpEx, excluding share-based compensation to the range of $350 million to $370 million. I think, Paul, we don't have guidance yet. We're busy doing planning for next year. But qualitatively, what I'd tell you is that we like where we're at in terms of our cost structure. We think it's much leaner and more scrappy of a position than how we started 2022. And you should expect that we'll continue to carefully manage our cost base as we grow from here. We'll make the investments that we think are prudent for growth, but we're going to do it with a lean and scrappy mindset. Sure. I'll start, and we'll see if Vlad has anything to add. So we love our strong balance sheet position, $6 billion in cash. I think we're in a really good position to be looking at growth, not just through investments in new products organically, but also through M&A transactions. It's a variety of types of companies that we might look at, whether it's acquisitions that are focused at kind of rounding out our portfolio of licenses or technology, but then also just with the vision of democratizing finance for all and that being so much more broad than simply trading I think there's a number of ways that we could extend the product offerings that Robinhood offers to customers through M&A. So we've got a solid team. We're paying really close attention to the opportunities that are out there, but we're going to be diligent in the way that we deploy our capital. Yes, I'll take the first part, for sure. So we're seeing a really nice uptick in deposits in the gold sweep accounts. And we're finding that the majority is from new deposits with the rest largely coming from upgrades to gold. So really exciting for us. It's encouraging to see the overall balance of our interest-earning assets increasing and that's even with some offsets with strong net buying into this market by our customers. . In terms of gold enhancements, I'll comment, but glad you can weigh in. I think that there's a lot of opportunities across the products that we offer today to make gold really appealing. Essentially, we'd like to have gold be the best deal in financial services. And I think whether you look at the Cash Card or crypto and other areas of our business, there's opportunity for us to invest here. stepping back, gold was a product a couple of years ago that we added a number of features to. We saw a lot of interest by customers at the time to join gold.  But frankly, over the last couple of years, we've had other priorities as we dealt with the super high growth that our business was experiencing. And we're changing that. We increased the sweep balance rate for gold members to 3%. We're going to take it even higher, and we're encouraged to find other ways to add to that value proposition. Yes. I think there's a few things that go into share-based compensation. First is just the effect of awards that have been historically granted I made comments last quarter that about half of our share-based compensation last quarter was from the pre-IPO awards that were granted to founders that are significantly out of the money. You mentioned the workforce reduction that has an impact, but also just lower rate of hiring. When you -- when we've historically given share-based awards to new employees. Those are 4-year awards historically, and that can be very expensive as you're ramping up your workforce. And so slowing that way down has had a positive effect.  And then I would say that given what's happened in the stock market, we also look kind of offsetting that. We also look to make sure that we continue to retain our top talent. And so additional awards were necessary here in the back part of the year, which helps bridge why it's going up on a net basis, net of the reversals in Q3. Yes, sounds good. Rich, I think we like our OpEx position now. And like I said earlier to Josh's question, we're going to have a mindset of being lean and scrappy as we grow from here. But that doesn't mean that we're not going to make thoughtful investments and deliberate investments to drive to drive growth. We're in the middle right now of our 2023 planning. So I'm just not in a position to kind of talk about expense guidance for next year. But it's not a fun experience to bring down the costs the way that we've done. And so as we go forward, we're going to be very mindful to be deliberate in the way that we increase costs going forward. But there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us. We'll make appropriate investments from here. Yes, I appreciate the question. And what I can tell you is that you start with roughly $16 billion, $17 billion of interest earning assets. Included in there is our margin book, and we've seen that come down a bit in October to below $4 billion. And so we're factoring in the variability of that as we think about guidance for the rest of this quarter. Additionally, in October, securities lending has been pretty soft. And so we're being pretty cautious there as well as we think about how the rest of the quarter will play out. And then, of course, with the Fed rate increase, while we'll enjoy increased rates on a large portion of our interest-earning assets, as you mentioned, we also intend to pass some value back to customers in the gold sweep product. So those are kind of the moving parts, and we think $25 million incremental. First of all, we're really pleased that it's growing and that overall net interest earning assets are growing as well. Yes. So we continue to be really optimistic about the fully paid securities offering. We had $4 million of revenue this -- in Q3 from fully paid securities lending. And that's after just a handful of months of launching that product. We're already at 15% of the revenue that we're generating from margin sec lending, which has been around for several years. So it's still very early. It is a difficult market out there and it's evolving. But we have a lot of optimism that this could be a meaningful portion of our securities lending revenue over time. Yes. It's Jason. I'll take that one. Looking over the long term, I don't see any structural reason why we wouldn't have margins that are kind of in line with what you see at others in the industry. It's going to vary depending on the period and as we roll out new products and how that affects our mix of business. But we'll manage our costs, we'll build for the future with new products. And over the long term, we think will drive pretty attractive margins for shareholders. Yes. So we're increasing our spending in marketing in Q4. You might have seen us with some television ads that have recently started and we tried to signal that last quarter that we begin doing that. Historically, the vast majority of our customers have come to us through referrals and word of mouth. And that's driven really attractive tax and returns, and digital paid ads has also been an area that we focused on for marketing.  What we found in periods of relative high interest in investing that it really pays to kind of lean in to paid advertising. But in periods like we're in right now of lower interest in investing, we haven't found it to really make economic sense to lean in and spend more for growth. And so we've been cautious there, and it's something that we're going to watch carefully. But in the near term, what we're doing is really focusing on some brand-building advertising. And if you haven't seen it, check out our advertisements, we really like them. Before we end the call, I just want to finish by saying that we've made the decision to take our gold sweep interest rate to 3.75%. So we think that's just absolutely tremendous for customers, and we're excited to deliver that to them."

            "name": "Vladimir Tenev",
            "content": "Thanks for the intro, Chris, and thanks to everyone for joining. 6 months ago, we set an ambitious goal for us to return to adjusted EBITDA profitability by the end of the year, I'm proud to that we achieved this milestone a quarter ahead of schedule, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. In Q3, we had adjusted EBITDA of $47 million, in spite of a tough macro backdrop, we were able to simultaneously decrease cost, increase revenues and demonstrate diversification of our business model. We feel our cost structure is in a good place. So we're now fully focused on delivering great products and service for our customers and growing our business. I'll tell you more about our plans here.  But first, let's take a look at how our customers are doing. Amidst the challenging macro environment, customers continue to trust us with billions of dollars of net deposits each quarter as they invest through the cycle for the long term. Excluding those deposits, our customers' portfolios, on average, slightly outperformed the NASDAQ and S&P in Q3. These factors drove customer assets under custody, up by about 1% to $65 billion despite equity market values declining again this quarter. This environment highlights the importance of serving our customers' financial needs through the cycle and of diversifying our business beyond trading.  So let me tell you more about some of the products we're working on across brokerage, crypto and money. Starting with brokerage. Today's high interest rates can be challenging for customers with mortgages, student loans and car payments. At the same time, they present an opportunity for our customers to earn 1 of the highest yields available on their uninvested cash at levels not seen in over a decade. In September, we introduced a fantastic interest rate for our gold members, 3% on cash via our sweep program with no balance limits, none of the time commitments that CDs have and FDIC insurance of up to $1.5 million, 6x what you get from a typical bank account.  We're really excited about this product because it helps customers earn on their cash even when they're not investing. And so far, we like what we see with gold cash sweep balances up by over $1.5 billion since we raised rates. And following today's Fed rate hike, we'll raise the interest rate for gold customers even higher. This is just another 1 of the investments we're planning for the coming years to make Robinhood Gold the best deal in financial services.  We also want to provide great value for customers, investing for the long term at Robinhood, so we're excited to launch Robinhood Retirement, just in time for the New Year and the heart of IRA season. For our customers looking to open a new retirement account or roll over an existing IRA or taking their first steps in long-term investing. We're excited to share this product with you, and we know you'll love it.  Finally, I want to share some of the great work our brokerage team has been doing for our advanced customers. Recall, our advanced customers are customers who trade more actively and use more sophisticated products like options. We're 1 of the very few platforms that offer options trading with no contract fees. And this is incredibly valuable for customers who place a lot of option trades. In case you don't know about this, most companies charge something like a $0.65 per contract fee for each option trade. And that's in addition to payment for order flow at about the same levels we generate. And while that may not sound like a lot of money, not paying those fees saved our customers over $600 million in the past year. We love saving money for our customers like this and think customers of a lot of other firms are paying way too much to trade options.  Now at the start of the year, our advanced customers were, on average, less satisfied with our service than our other customers. So we listen to their feedback and double down on building products designed for them, starting with hyper extended trading hours and stock lending. We kept hearing they wanted more trading data, tools and analytics in the app. So in August, we rolled out advanced charts. We built these natively to give advanced customers quick, simple, customizable and in-depth analysis that they want for trading without cluttering the user interface.  Additionally, while churn is at the lowest level in years, a leading driver of advanced customer churn was not being able to trade options in cash accounts. So we are pleased to roll out this feature in July. And in the past 6 months, we've seen a flip where advanced customers now have higher satisfaction with the Robinhood experience than our other customers. Of course, there's always more to do, and we're continuing to invest to make Robinhood a fantastic platform for everyone.  Now let's move to crypto. We want everyone to have safe, easy and low-cost access to the power of the decentralized web, which we believe is the future operating system of financial services. So after building a wait list of more than 1 million people since May, we're excited that we rolled out the beta of the Robinhood Wallet, our self-custody Web 3 wallet to the first 10,000 customers last month. While it's early, we're hearing from customers that they love the simple and intuitive mobile experience and they really love the no gas fees. They also tell us that they'd like us to add more blockchains to increase the breadth of coins available for them to swap and trade. We're encouraged to see this enthusiastic early response and we'll keep enhancing the wallet. And we're planning to roll the Robinhood wallet out internationally. So we're excited that this will be our first product available to people all over the world.  We also continue to roll out more coins over the past quarter in a deliberate and considered manner. One of these was our first stable coin USDC from Circle. As part of this rollout, we're creating a new free educational program called Learn and Earn that gives our customers the ability to earn crypto simply by learning about it. We're excited to roll this out and give our customers even more reasons to engage with our awesome educational content.  Now let's talk about Robinhood Money, which includes our cash card as well as tools to move money in and out of Robinhood. While it's still early for our cash card, which launched in March, we have over 500,000 customers today. We're focused on continuing to improve the experience. So more customers use the Cash Card as the top card in their wallet. Looking ahead, we're excited to be introducing the new card to our 6 million legacy cash management customers soon, so they can also enjoy the enhanced benefits.  Another Robinhood staple that customers have loved for years, is our seamless instant deposits. And this is something that we continue to invest in, including giving gold customers the ability to make instant deposits of up to $50,000. We realized that some customers want to be able to withdraw their money instantly as well rather than weight up to 5 business days for traditional ACH transfers. So last month, we started rolling out instant withdrawals, providing customers with a new option to withdraw cash instantly to participating banks at a competitive 1.5% price point, while always maintaining the ability to use free ACH transfers. We think customers will really like the experience and pricing of our new expedited service as well as having expanded choice of money movement options. We're excited to roll this out more broadly, and we're going to keep you posted on our progress here.  Stepping back a bit, we've seen and managed through a lot of change in the past year, change in the economy, geopolitics, financial markets and change in Robinhood as well. We've gone from an environment of easy money to want to focus and constraint in the outside world and within Robinhood itself. And while it's been hard, I think this transformation has been incredibly positive for the company. Despite significantly trimming our headcount and expenses, we've seen our fastest product velocity and iteration speed and our service quality for customers is the best I've seen.  Our focus remains on building exceptional products that give ordinary people control over their financial lives and giving open access to tools once reserved for the rich. I'm lucky to be working with such a talented team. And I again wanted to congratulate them for driving us to adjusted EBITDA profitability 1 quarter ahead of schedule.  With that, let me turn it over to Jason. I'll field that one. The short answer is yes to both. So we're excited to roll out retirement just in time for the tax season. The team has been working hard at it. I think you'll really like what the product is going to look like and the value prop for customers. And we're polishing it and making sure that it looks great. But we feel good about rolling it out just in time for the tax season. Yes, it will. So we'll have additional context as we get closer, but we think people are really going to like it. Thanks, Brian. While we don't have near-term plans to offer bonds. We do have a lot of solutions for customers that want exposure to fixed income products. So of course, we already offer bond ETFs. And as I mentioned in the call, we have a very competitive offering for gold customers where we pay them interest on their uninvested cash. So that rate has been 3% since the last Fed rate hike and will actually increase even further after today's Fed rate hike.  In terms of bonds and adding more instruments to Robinhood, we haven't been hearing a lot of customers requesting those specifically. That said, we understand that with retirement and as we continue to add more tools for long-term investors who are diversifying, we might begin to see more feedback about that. So we're obviously always listening to customers and we're able and excited to add the products that they care about most. So we're going to continue to keep an eye on that. For credit cards, we don't have any near-term plans here. But today, we offer a debit card with rewards and merchant incentives, and also 2-day early pay if you direct deposit your paycheck. So this was introduced with the launch of the Robinhood Cash Card earlier this year. So we recognize customers may want access to credit, particularly in this environment. So we're going to be looking at that, but no immediate near-term plans for credit cards. Yes, I'll field this one. So in terms of IPOs that we offer on the Robinhood platform. We have some selection criteria. And the fact of the matter is this has been a really slow year for IPOs that would be big enough in terms of market cap to feature to our customer base. So understanding that this is cyclical as soon as the IPO market turns around and we see more IPOs that meet those criteria, we're going to be hard at work to bring those to our customers so that they can participate. Yes, I'll take that one. Thank you for the question, [indiscernible]. The short answer is next year. So we plan to roll out the Robinhood Wallet internationally. So that will be available internationally or early next year. And this will actually be our first product available to customers all over the world. And as Jason mentioned, there is some regulatory uncertainty that we continue to work on our Ziglu acquisition. Yes. Thanks, Atanu. So as we think about shareholder value, we recognize that the stock performance as well as the overall market has been hard for shareholders this year. And we're hard at work, adding value to our business. So let me tell you how we're thinking about this. First, we're very focused on our cost structure. And as you guys have seen, we've made a lot of progress here in the last couple of quarters, and it's going to be important for us to manage the as we grow from here. Second, we've got a lot of improvements that we've made to existing products. We've introduced new products. And we have really tremendous progress here as well.  As I mentioned earlier in the call, the product velocity, the improvements in service quality and product quality for our existing products has been some of the best that I've seen since starting Robinhood. And I expect that to continue. And we're going to be focused and constrained, and we're probably not going to be able to get to as many things as if the market was doing a little bit better. But I think the things that we do get to are going to be tremendous, and we're going to continue to have good velocity, and we think if we keep doing both of these things, if we keep improving the product quality of our existing products and rolling out really impactful new products, we're going to deliver a lot of shareholder value over time. Yes, I'll field that one. This is something that I'm very excited about. So I mean, Robin Hood has really been about modernizing stock trading and bringing it into the 21st century from the time we got started. So we were the first to introduce the 0 commission model, we made it seamless to use on mobile. And 1 of the things that's particularly archaic right now is the fact that stock trading in U.S. equities, which is such a large and vibrant market is structured around East Coast working hours. So our goal is to modernize that and deliver 24/7 round-the-clock stock trading, making investing accessible whenever people want. . We think this is particularly going to be important as we start offering our services internationally. So at Robinhoo today, and this is as of earlier this year, people can trade for over half of the day. So starting at 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern. We're now beta testing even longer trading hours, which include 4 a.m. to 7 a.m. Eastern. So extending it by 3 hours in the early mornings. And so once that's launched, customers will be able to trade for 16 hours a day. And so you're continuing to see us make progress. And the goal is to get to 24/7 trading as soon as possible. So plenty of exciting work happening there. Yes. Thank you for that, Marcus. So if you really look back, I think a lot of the negative sentiment that you're seeing goes back to the mean stock rally around January of 2021, so nearly 2 years ago. And at that point, we had to make a very difficult decision to take away the buy button on some stocks, and we didn't earn too many fans through that to put it mildly. And it's been hard work to regain trust. We've made a lot of progress.  I think a lot of it starts from improving the quality of the service, listening to customers, showing that we are a reputable and reliable and solid platform for them. And we've been measuring this actually. We've seen that we've made a lot of strides in customer Net Promoter Score. Every time we improve the service offering, we improve customer support, particularly when we added 24/7 live phone support and followed that up with chat, we see these measures pick up. So we made a lot of progress. But as they say, trust takes a while to build and rebuild and we're focused on the long term, and we believe that the work that we're doing to make our service better and particularly for advanced customers is starting to pay significant dividends for us. So I know it's a long answer, but we believe that in this case, as we continue to do the right thing, build exceptional products, the sort of like media and Reddit and social media recognition is going to follow that. Sure, Sajan and thank you. It's great to see you asking good questions, earnings call after earnings call. So stepping back, the goal of Robinhood crypto, as we've stated, is to be the safest, most trusted and lowest cost on-ramp to the decentralized web. So I think this is a great example of building the trust that we were just talking about. We're very selective about the coins that we list on the platform. We have a rigorous coin listing framework, which we believe is best-in-class. We're also not engaged in crypto lending. We custody coins. And with the Robinhood wallet that we just introduced the 10,000 beta customers. We give customers the option to sell custody as well. And we're also in regular contact with the SEC about the crypto offering.  So you'll see us continue to take a deliberate approach, and we hope that customers understand and appreciate that we're moving carefully. And sometimes, that means moving a little bit slower than a lot of these other crypto companies. But again, we want to be extremely deliberate and to help protect customers and their money. Yes. This is a great question. So coming back to our mission, the mission of Robinhood is to democratize finance for all. And what that means to us is really building exceptional products that give ordinary people control over their financial lives and giving open access to tools that were previously available only to the wealthy. And so if you look out 5 years, what would we like Robinhood to do?  The first thing is we'd like Robinhood to be -- to serve our customers' entire portfolios and entire wallet. So we'd like you to find value and direct deposit in your paycheck into Robinhood and using Robinhood for all of your spending for you to use it for saving. Of course, all of the investing that we offer right now, but also long-term retirement and passive. So we want Robinhood to be the highest value and best user experience tool for you to manage all of your money.  The second thing is we want Robinhood to be the default choice for your first financial account. So that entails always being focused on the next generation of customers. We don't want to just be a millennial-focused company and grow with our customers because I think that's the recipe for eventually being irrelevant. So every every generation, we have to continue to adapt our offerings and be top of mind as our customers think about opening not just their first investing account, but also the first place they deposit their paycheck and the first account they used to the spend out of. And then also, we're going to be a global company.  So we think crypto is a big part of that, and we're excited to continue to invest there. We've been making a ton of investments in the past year despite it being crypto winter. And we want Robinhood to serve the entire world and offer low-cost, extremely simple and affordable and easy-to-use services to a much broader market. And if you look at it, the U.S. is actually fairly well served here. We've got lots of people around the world that can't even benefit from a functional financial system. So we think there's not just a big opportunity, but a big a big part of our mission is serving those customers overseas. So there's going to be a lot of work done to invest and innovate in crypto and to expand international as well. Yes. I'll take that one. So as I mentioned earlier, we're really excited about serving our customers' needs more broadly than investing. So we see the opportunity to actually evolve the cash card to be people's primary spending account. So we'd like our customers to direct deposit their paychecks. And we've started building things to make that process easier, like 2-day early pay and also the ability to auto invest your paycheck. And it's starting to see good adoption among our existing customers to the point where we have over 6 million customers on legacy cash management, and we feel really good about starting to move those customers over.  And I think at that point, the cash card will have exposure to a significant portion of our customer base. This is earning the right to be someone's paycheck direct deposit institution of choice is going to take time. We know that this is a new product for us. but we're very excited about the team and the strategy ahead for 2023. So I think you're going to like what you see out of the cash part. Yes. I just -- I would say, we feel really good about our position. We've been very patient. And I think that patience has really sort of been very positive in this environment as we're continuing to see more and more opportunities out there of, in some cases, high-quality companies trading at prices that are sort of a fraction of what they were earlier this year. Yes. The only thing I would add is that gold started out as a product intended for active customers primarily with value props like margin trading and higher instant deposits as well as Level 2 market data and sort of more advanced data. And the competitive interest on uninvested cash is kind of the first foray into making the product useful to people that aren't active investors. And I think as you see us continue to diversify our product suite and enter into other products. We're asking our teams to really keep in mind what what value we can make so that gold customers do get the best deal in financial services.  And so gold is kind of becoming a little bit more of our planning process as we roll out these new products. I think we see lots of opportunities where customers can get an even better deal or kind of transition their usage of Robinhood into more of like an all-you-can-eat model and get more simplicity from how they use their product. Yes, maybe Jason can take this one, Rich, and I can add some color if needed. Yes. And I would just say that the balance we aim to strike at kind of the beginning of the year when we set the adjusted EBITDA positive goal was to get our cost structure in a good place and to demonstrate that we can be a sustainable business in tough economic times. And then we actually know that we can do quite well when economic times and monetary policy is a little bit looser. And I think we're proud of the progress there. And we wanted to do that while also taking advantage of the environment where a lot of other companies are pulling back to accelerate our own momentum.  So as you've kind of seen, we've continued to improve the product offering dramatically. We've rolled out new products this year. And so we're happy about the balance and we're going to continue to invest to drive customer growth and revenues and shareholder value in the future. I think the number is actually public. So if you go to robinhood3.com, you should be able to get the real-time wait list figure. So yes, as I mentioned, we've rolled it out to 10,000. We're watching the feedback closely. We're going to be rolling out to more in the coming months. And we're getting some really, really good feedback from customers. We can tell that they really like the no gas fees. They like the user interface and the experience and they're giving us useful feedback on multi-chain and other things. So we're not in a hurry. We could roll it out faster if we wanted to, but we want to make sure that the product improves, it is really, really good when it's generally available. And we expect that to to happen early next year. We have been hearing from some of our crypto enthusiasts that they want at the very least to be able to view their NFTs in wallet. I think trading NFTs in app is a little bit complicated with the recent Apple guidance. So we're keeping an eye on that. But I think it's highly likely that we'll add the ability to view NFTs and for people to custody them. Yes. I mean, the great thing about the Robinhood Wallet is, we've got a very lean team working on it. Of course, there's the requisite kind of compliance and infrastructure you need, but it's essentially a software product. And so the nature of it being noncustodial and blockchain-based means that it's kind of international by default. And the experience is simple and very straightforward and kind of really targeted towards the value prop of great UX and gasless swapping of tokens. And so we've kind of built it with the idea of being international native from the beginning, which I think makes it much more straightforward. Yes. I think for the custody solution and the brokerage, so custodial crypto and brokerage, it's a little bit different. But certainly, there's value that we'll get from rolling out the noncustodial wallet internationally and from creating kind of a more simple and focused staff because it's very likely that in some jurisdictions, we'll be crypto first and others will be brokerage first. But we're not going to be able to -- we're unlikely to make all of the Robinhood U.S. features available in every jurisdiction, at least on the outset. Yes. I think that's a great value in this environment. That's a hard rate to beat. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining. As always, we've appreciated the questions. Congrats to the team again for a strong quarter and delivering adjusted EBITDA profitability a quarter ahead of schedule, and we're getting back to work. There's a lot more to do to deliver on democratizing finance for all. So thank you."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Koegel, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Koegel: Thank you, Victor. Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Robinhood's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With us today are CEO and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev; and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements about our financial outlook and our strategic and operational plans. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor are described in our press release issued yesterday, the related slide presentation on our Investor Relations website, our Form 10-Q filed this afternoon and in our other SEC filings. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investors.robinhood.com. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you, Chris, for that great introduction, and thanks to everyone for joining. Last week was the one-year anniversary of our IPO and in the 12 months since we've had to navigate two challenges, one is adapting to the public markets, and two of also dealing with an abrupt reversal of the macro environment. For our customers, many of whom are younger, it looks like they may be facing a recession for the first time in their adult lives if the last two quarters of negative GDP growth or any indication. Customers are seeing this high inflation along with high interest rates, bear markets and stocks and a crypto winter. And this all adds up to less money to spend and therefore, less to save and invest. You can also see this reflected in the drop in assets under custody that we reported. Despite strong net deposits of over $5 billion in Q2, you can see that our assets under custody dropped. And this shows that customers have been hurt by devaluation across crypto currencies and growth stocks in particular. And while we can't control the macro environment, we've been hard at work building products to help our customers navigate it. Products like the Cash Card, Stock Lending and high yield on their uninvested cash. I'd have to say 2022 is by far our most prolific year yet of delivering products to customers, and we've got much more in the works. For Robinhood in the seven or so years since we first launched in the US, we've consistently adapted to changes improved and become more robust and resilient as a company. If we're headed into our first recession in the company's history, we recognize it would be a challenging time, but strong companies use these times as opportunities, and we look forward to navigating through this environment and coming out even stronger. To that end, we made a tough call to further reduce our staff, which we announced the details of yesterday. These are hard decisions, but we believe they better position our business for the long term. So alongside the reduction in force, we organized the company into a general manager structure for each of our core business units. We've been thinking about this change for some time, and I'm confident that it will speed up decision-making, increase accountability. And ultimately, it will help us deliver even faster for our customers. This is just one part of our leaner operating model, and Jason will share more color on this in his remarks. Now onto the quarter. Despite the environment weakening, we were able to both increase our revenues and lower our expenses in Q2 compared to Q1. Now this was a company-wide effort, and I am proud of the team for the hard work and dedication it took to get here. It certainly wasn't easy. We believe we're making swift progress toward our goal of being adjusted EBITDA positive by the end of the year. So let's move on and talk a little bit about our product road map. Remember, our goal is to deliver low-cost, simple products and a safe customer experience that give everyday people control over their finances and access to the same tools that wealthy people have enjoyed for generations. We've organized our efforts into three product areas: brokerage, crypto and money. So I'd like to review each of those with you. Let's start with brokerage. To put things in perspective, Robinhood is the most downloaded brokerage you have in the US. We achieved this leadership position by aggressively innovating, which in turn fueled our account and asset growth. To continue driving growth, we have focused our brokerage product development this year on two key areas: one, introducing retirement accounts; and the second, improving our customer experience, particularly for advanced customers. So starting with retirement accounts, I can't tell you how excited we are about this product. We feel like we've come up with a way to offer retirement that is uniquely Robinhood, and we know our customers will love it as much as we do. We're piloting them now with plans to launch later this year. Additionally, retirement accounts will be the first time our customers will be able to have multiple brokerage accounts with us. We think this creates a big opportunity for us to broaden our support for and deepen our relationships with our customers over time. It's also a new avenue for us to drive account and asset growth and increase our total share of wallet. Next, let's turn to our advanced customers. In Q1, we extended market hours. So customers now have more flexibility to trade when they want and customers have now traded over $9 billion in volume during these additional hours. Extending trading hours we view as the first step towards 24/7 stock trading, and we are making progress towards making this a reality. In Q2, we also rolled out fully paid securities lending to give customers another source of passive income on their stocks, which is especially important in the current environment. We're encouraged to see the early progress with over $3 billion of equity value already enrolled and available to lend. We've also been making a ton of improvements to our options product. We believe our options offering is the lowest cost and best user experience offering out there. Most of our competitors say they're zero commissions, but they, in fact, charge a $0.65 commission for every contract treated, which is $65 for a $100 contract trade, which are $0 per contract. Recently, we've added options in cash accounts, which has been a top requested feature by our actions customers. We've also been doing a ton of in-person research with this group, and we recognize they care a lot about advanced charting on the platform. So we're making our charting and technical indicators much better, and there is plenty more to come. Keep the feedback coming. Our team has been working tirelessly to make Robinhood by far, the best place to trade. Now, let's turn to our crypto efforts. Our vision with crypto is to be the most trusted platform for customers to invest in crypto as well as the most trusted on-ramp to the decentralized web. That is why after first introducing crypto investing in 2018, we've been relentlessly focused on three things: providing the best value, the best user experience and being the safest. So, let me tell you what we are delivering for customers in crypto by highlighting two areas that we've been working on this year, adding more coins and giving customers more control over their crypto. Starting with coins. Customers tell us that they want us to introduce more coins onto the platform. Some other crypto providers have come under scrutiny for listing unregistered securities on their platforms. This can be dangerous and misleading for customers, because they may expect these cryptos to be more decentralized than they really are. We employ a rigorous listing framework, which in the short-term may feel like we aren't moving fast enough. But we think this approach will pay off in the long-term. Frankly, one of the benefits of being heavily regulated and a US-based company is that it has helped us learn how to build with customer safety in mind. So far in a deliberate and considered manner, we have introduced a number of new coins this year, and customers have been pleased with the offerings to date. Turning to our efforts to give customers more control over their crypto. In April, we launched our crypto wallet. So customers can move their crypto in and out of Robinhood in a simple, safe and seamless way. We've heard feedback that customers want faster withdrawals and larger daily limits. So we raised our withdrawal limits from $3,000 to $5,000 per day and are working on improving this even more. Later this year, we will be rolling out our non-custodial wallets. This will be a separate stand-alone app, where customers can trade and swap crypto with no network fees and maintain full custody of their crypto throughout, all with the simplicity and great user experience they have come to expect from Robinhood. We're seeing good interest as our non-custodial wait list continues to grow, and our early internal version of the product looks awesome. We think customers are going to love it. Okay. Let's now move to our product development efforts related to Robinhood Money, which includes our new cash card. We hear from customers that they want to start saving and investing, but the current environment is hard with inflation and high gas prices. We want to help them by giving them a good way to build saving and investing habits even in the current environment. And to that end, in March, we launched the new Robinhood Cash Card. Customers are using the card to make day-to-day purchases and round up their spare change into stocks, ETFs and crypto. And of course, not only are we not charging any monthly fees for this, but we're actually matching a portion of their roundups to help them build their portfolios. So, it's a fantastic value for customers. And we've been pleased with the week-over-week growth and the cohort retention we've been seeing. Since launch, we've been making steady improvements to the user experience as well. And last week, we started rolling out cash back offers that select merchants, including on gas, doing our part to help customers with these high gas prices. We believe we have a huge opportunity to become the primary place where customers deposit their paychecks, which drive their spending and investing. And while it's still early, we're excited about our potential to grow this offering with both existing and new customers and drive additional customer loyalty as well as revenue diversification over time. Now, before passing it over to Jason, I wanted to reiterate how extremely proud I am of all the progress we've made over the past quarter, with the new products we've shipped and the work we've done to improve the experience for our customers. And when I look ahead, I feel even better positioned to execute on our roadmap and serve our customers. And with that, let me turn it over to Jason.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. In the second quarter, we remain focused on serving our customers, growing our business and driving long-term shareholder value. While the environment was volatile, net funded accounts were steady and net deposits were strong. And the combined strength of our team, platform and balance sheet positioned us to continue delivering on our 2022 product road map. I'm also pleased that we've increased our productivity and efficiency, driving improvements to adjusted EBITDA from Q1. We've made great progress so far this year, and I'm energized by the opportunities to drive value for our customers and shareholders going forward. Before we review our Q2 results, I'd like to share some context for the August workforce reduction that we announced yesterday. Since we spoke last quarter, we've continued to aggressively execute on our product road map and serve our customers while working hard to get to a leaner operating model, including by slowing our hiring and significantly lowering third-party spend, but the macro environment has continued to soften, inflation is at a four-year high, and our customers are experiencing bare markets and equities and crypto. It's clear we needed to do more to manage our costs. And so yesterday, we announced a 23% reduction from current levels to a headcount of approximately 2,600. At this new level, we believe we are appropriately staffed to be cost efficient, while continuing to deliver great service and innovation for our customers. To be clear, even with this reduction, we believe we are well positioned to continue delivering on our road map. With that context in mind, let's review the second quarter, starting with our business results. Net funded accounts were $22.9 million in Q2, up $100,000 from the prior quarter and notably steady given the current environment. Looking at monthly active users, they were $14 million in Q2, while this is down $1.9 million from Q1, we are encouraged by our continued industry-leading engagement through a volatile quarter. Turning to assets under custody. They were $64 billion in Q2, down 31% from last quarter. While funded accounts continue to grow and customers continue to make net deposits through the volatile environment, Assets under custody declined along with decreases in market valuations, especially for high-growth stocks and cryptocurrencies. Looking at July, it's encouraging to see that customer assets increased back over $70 billion as markets rebounded. Looking more closely at net deposits. They were $5.2 billion in Q2, which translates to a 22% annualized growth rate relative to Q1 assets under custody. So while assets were lower in Q2, if we think about our long-term potential for asset growth, we believe the combination of strong net deposits and long-term rising markets can drive meaningful asset growth over time. Now let's turn to our Q2 financial results, which reflect good progress on increasing profitability. Adjusted EBITDA improved $63 million sequentially to negative $80 million in Q2. This improvement was driven by revenue growth and expense discipline that drove operating leverage. Looking ahead, we continue to push towards a positive adjusted EBITDA run rate by the end of the year. This goal is an important step along the way to delivering higher levels of profitability over time. We feel that our progress over the past quarter has better positioned us to reach our goal by year-end, which will take continued improvements in both revenue and costs. So let's start with revenues. Total net revenues were $318 million in Q2. This was a 6% increase from Q1, primarily driven by higher net interest and other revenues, partially offset by lower transaction revenues. Q2 total revenue translates to ARPU of $56, up from $53 last quarter. Now moving to transaction-based revenues. They were $202 million in Q2, down 7% sequentially. The decrease was primarily driven by lower trading volumes consistent with the macro environment. And turning to net interest revenues. As we've discussed in the past, we believe that over the long-term, interest income will drive a larger portion of our revenue. That is why we're encouraged that Q2 net interest revenues reached a new high of $74 million and drove nearly a quarter of total Q2 revenues. The 35% increase from Q1 was primarily due to the March and June Fed rate hikes, partially offset by lower margin balances. I'd also note that interest-earning assets, which are comprised of customer cash, corporate cash and margin balances were $16 billion at the end of Q2. This includes customer cash sweep balances, earning 1%, which totaled over $2 billion in Q2. As we look ahead, interest rates are widely expected to continue rising, which would drive meaningful additional revenue from our interest-earning assets. One way to see that benefit is to look at our recent experience from the June and July Fed rate hikes that totaled 150 basis points. On average, we estimate that we are realizing about $40 million of annualized run rate revenue per 25 basis points of rate hike given our current balances and customer rates. Of course, the precise benefit of rate hikes will depend on how the benefit of rate hikes will depend on how balances and customer rates vary over time. Moving on to other revenues. They were $42 million in Q2, up 62% from Q1 primarily due to the seasonal increase in proxy-related revenues. Together, net interest and other revenue made up 36% of total revenue in Q2, up from 27% in Q1, continuing to broaden our product offering can help us further diversify our revenues going forward. Let's now look at our Q2 expenses, starting with operating expenses prior to share-based compensation. They were $446 million in Q2, which includes $17 million of severance related to our April workforce reduction. This was an improvement of $24 million or 5% from Q1, reflecting our work to be more cost efficient including with third parties. Given this progress on our ongoing expenses and our August workforce reduction, we're lowering our full year expense outlook. Our updated outlook for 2022 operating expenses prior to share-based compensation is a range of $1.7 billion to $1.76 billion, which would be a year-over-year decline of 7% to 10% in operating costs. This updated outlook includes the cost of an estimated $45 million to $60 million of severance and restructuring expenses related to our August workforce reduction. Turning to share-based compensation expense, which, as a reminder, reflects the number of shares and our share price at the time the awards were granted. It was $164 million in Q2, down by $56 million or 25% from Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by a $24 million reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation related to our April workforce reduction and a reduced pace of hiring this year. I'd also highlight that 50% of our Q2 expense was driven by pre-IPO market-based awards for our two founders that will vest only as our share price reaches levels from $50 to $300, but are recognized on a GAAP basis as expenses over time. These awards won't increase our share count until our share price appreciates considerably, which would be a great outcome for shareholders. As for our 2022 outlook for share-based compensation, we are lowering our expense outlook for the year. We now anticipate 2022 share-based compensation expense to be in the range of $760 million to $840 million, down between 47% to 52% from prior year levels. This updated outlook includes the benefit of an estimated $40 million to $50 million reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation related to our August workforce reduction. I also want to highlight that given our reduced pace of hiring and workforce reductions, we are now on a significantly lower trajectory of diluted share count growth than we have seen over the past year. While we believe that it's important to align the interest of employees with shareholders, this will be an area we will be managing closely. Now, let's turn to capital management. In the current environment, it's even more important to have a strong balance sheet and cash position. That is why we like our position with no debt and $6 billion of corporate cash on hand that provides strength, flexibility and financial runway to continue serving our customers, executing on our product roadmap, and evaluating potential acquisitions. As I mentioned last quarter, we have roughly $2.5 billion of excess cash above our risk scenarios. In closing, we continue to make good progress in Q2 and we're very optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us to deliver value for customers and shareholders. With that, Chris, let's move to Q&A.\nA - Chris Koegel: Thank you, Jason. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, we skipped over some of the top questions because Vlad and Jason already covered them in their remarks. So with that, I'll kick it off with a couple of our top questions that are on a similar theme from Say Technologies. These are both, I think, for Jason. So, [indiscernible] asks, having billions of dollars of cash, are you planning on buying back shares since the stock is at a low price? And then Seth G asks, any future plans for Robinhood to offer a dividend on their stock?\nJason Warnick: Thanks for each of those questions. We think the best use of our cash right now is to fund the business, both our organic initiatives to drive growth as well as potentially to use for acquisitions. I think a better time to be thinking for us to be thinking about returns of cash to shareholders is when we reach some goals further down the line around generating positive adjusted EBITDA and kicking off positive cash flow. But I appreciate the question.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Jason. Next question is from [indiscernible], who asks, following up if Robinhood can give out its gold services, if a retail owner owns enough stock in Robinhood, and also, any update on adding more advanced car trading features onto the app and website. Vlad, do you want to take that one?\nVlad Tenev: Yes, I'll take it. Thanks, [indiscernible] for the question. And it's good seeing you up here with top-loaded questions quarter after quarter. So on gold for shareholders, we don't have plans to offer that right now and to bundle gold with shareholder status, but I do want to touch on rewards to shareholders and Robinhood gold briefly. So on the first, you might have seen that, say, which we're all using for this Q&A, launched a product called Otway recently. So this will actually allow us to work with our corporate partners to identify shareholders and offer them perks and rewards. This is a first-of-its-kind offering, really allowing public companies to identify their shareholders. And we're excited to have Tesla being the first partner with us. But we think this is something that that more companies should be doing and we'd like to -- we're happy to offer the technology to make that easier for them. Now on the gold side, we think there's tremendous value in gold. And we've got a team of people hard at work to provide even more value. And we want goal to be so valuable that it's a no-brainer for all of our customers to be gold customers.\nA \u2013 Chris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. So the next question is on the M&A front. So any word on being acquired by FTX or Charles Schwab?\nA \u2013 Vlad Tenev: Sure. I'll take this one. So, in one word, no. I think we're in a great position as a stand-alone company. I love us as a stand-alone company. We've got a strong balance sheet. We've got an awesome team, and we're delivering on our product road map, as I mentioned, at a pace that we haven't seen before. So actually, I'd flip it on the other side. We actually see opportunities particularly in this market environment to leverage the balance sheet that we have, that's about $6 billion to acquire companies that can help us accelerate our road map. So we continue to be on the lookout there. And we remain, really excited by the opportunity we see ahead of us.\nA \u2013 Chris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Vlad. And thanks, Paul for asking that question. The next question is also from Mr. John P [ph] who asks -- also on the M&A front. Can you provide us with an update on the Ziglu acquisition and strategic plan for international expansion for this year?\nA \u2013 Vlad Tenev: Sure. And Sean John, I think I also missed the second part of your question before about advanced trading. So advanced charts is something that we've heard from customers about, and we've got some good tools for you in the works. So just stay tuned. We hope to -- we think you'll really love them. On the Ziglu acquisition and strategic plan for international expansion, so as we mentioned in the last call, we had entered into an agreement to acquire Ziglu. Now these agreements take normally a little while to close. So we're going through that process right now. And we're still on track to close by the end of the year. And I'm very excited, to bring Mark and the team on board and accelerate our entry into the UK and the rest of Europe. So very, very excited about that. And hopefully, it goes smoothly, we believe it will.\nA \u2013 Chris Koegel: All right. Next question is from MJS [ph], who asks -- or states that the five-year historical charts don't seem good enough. And can we do more MAX like others?\nA \u2013 Vlad Tenev: Yes. Thank you for that feedback. I always love hearing, feedback about the tools. We hear customers loud and clear, that they want better charting, more flexibility, more advanced charting, and more data. So we've been making lots of improvements to our offerings and charting will continue to get better and better. So just stay tuned. We've got some good stuff in the works for you.\nChris Koegel: Okay. Thanks, Vlad. The next question is from Andrew, who asks, why not allow us to start trading when the pre-market session opens at 4:00 a.m. Eastern?\nVlad Tenev: Yes, I'll fill that as well. Thanks, Andrew, for the question. So earlier this year, we announced our goal of making equity markets accessible 24/7, we think that it's actually silly that with all the technology we have nowadays, US equity markets are still tied to East Coast, United States working hours. So as the first step of that process, we extended our already extended trading hours to 4:00 a.m. Pacific to 5:00 p.m. Pacific. So that's 7:00 to 8:00 Eastern. The goal is to make that 24/7 along the way we might see opportunities depending on customer interest to make incremental progress and add more hours, which we'll certainly pursue and consider. So adding 4:00 a.m to 7:00 a.m. Eastern, I believe, is certainly something we're thinking about.\nChris Koegel: Great. And let's take one more top question. So the last one is from Anthony B., who asks, would Robinhood be able to provide a service that lets people get loans against their assets.\nVlad Tenev: Yes, I'll fill this one as well. Thank you, Anthony. So we already do provide a form of this. So in our margin offering, we allow customers to get a loan against their assets already within Robinhood. And we're actually -- previously, this offering was only available to Robinhood Gold customers, but we're actually making it available to all customers under different rates. So this will allow you, if you have over $2,000 in securities to borrow against them, you can either use that to buy more securities or even withdraw to your bank account or spend it through the Robinhood spending account and Cash Card. So yes, it's a very useful service. A lot of customers don't know that you can actually withdraw against your margin loan and get some liquidity without selling securities. So we'll definitely look to communicate that a little bit better and also looking at different ways to help customers generate some more liquidity, especially in this environment going forward.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Vlad and that's for top question for today from today. So thank you, everyone, for your questions. We really appreciate all the thoughtful engagement from our shareholders and customers. So it's time to open up the line. And we'd ask each analyst to limit their questions to one question and one follow-up. So with that, I'll ask Victor, please to open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Good afternoon, everyone.\nVlad Tenev: Hi, Devin.\nJason Warnick: Hi, Devin. Good afternoon.\nDevin Ryan: Hi. First question, just want to talk about marketing spend a bit here. It was only $24 million in the quarter. It's down 75% year-over-year. A little bit surprising just given all the new products that you're rolling out, including cash management. So just trying to think about whether it makes sense to maybe lean in more on marketing, particularly with all the new products launching, or do you guys see other ways to maybe get the word out and engage with new and existing investors just with all these new products and just particularly in a competitive market to get the name out?\nVlad Tenev: Yes, I'll field that. I think historically, Robinhood has been very much driven by word-of-mouth growth and even the marketing expense that we accrued through 2021 in large part was as a result of our referral program. We did do a little bit of brand marketing as well, but I think performance and referral program were largely driving 2021. And as the environment has, kind of, changed through 2022, we've been heads down focusing on products and improving the service quality. But we actually do see an opportunity to get the word out and do more brand marketing and make it clear to customers what Robinhood stands for and our mission and our position in the segment, as you point out. So Yes, I would expect to see a little bit more on the brand side and on the performance, as I'm sure Jason can add, we're very much focused on efficiency. And we think that organic and referral-based marketing is -- is kind of the best way, and we'll see that pick up as the macro environment changes and as we continue to improve our products.\nJason Warnick: As you think about modeling this, we'd expect marketing expense to increase in the back half of the year. It's incorporated in the guidance that we provided.\nDevin Ryan: Yes. Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. And then just a follow-up here. So funded accounts were up slightly, MAUs down, I think, 12%. Most other -- the incumbent brokers don't give MAUs, but I'm assuming engagement been down at a number of firms just in the uncertain macro backdrop. Does it feel like we're approaching a bottom for engagement in MAUs? I'm not sure if you have any data or, kind of, historical benchmarks to look at. And then of that $14 million, is 20% driving 80% of the trading activity in revenue, or what does that split look like? I'm assuming of the $14 million, there's still kind of a small amount that's driving the majority, but want some more color there, too.\nJason Warnick: Yes. Devin, we do follow a Power law here. So the more active customers do drive more of the revenue versus the less active customers, and that's been true for some time. In terms of predicting the bottom, it is hard to predict. The market, the first half of the year has been about the worst that we've seen in about 50 years. Hard to know exactly when it's going to bottom out and turn around. I think we saw some life in July more broadly in the market, so that's an encouraging sign. And I commented in my prepared remarks about the effect it had on our customers rebound in assets under custody. What we are focusing on right now is just continuing to improve the user experience. I do think personally, this is a cycle, and we're in a cycle, other cycles will come long-term. I'm very optimistic that it's going to be great for retail investors to continue to invest in the stock market and participate in wealth building over the long-term.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Thanks very much.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Devin.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Richard Repetto from Piper Sandler.\nRichard Repetto: Yeah. Good afternoon, Vlad or Good afternoon, Vlad and Jason. I guess, the first question is on regulation Vlad. SEC Chair, Gensler came out again in June and talked about \u2013 well, we talked about the retail equity market structure. I think you stopped short of any \u2013 saying any specific bands, but it certainly sounded like he was proposing or wanted to propose things that would hinder the wholesalers and maybe payment for too. So any incremental comments from you on what you thought his talk and any other insights in regards to regulation?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. Yeah, sure, Rich. I mean, I think the first thing to say is, we're obviously paying close attention to what's coming out of the commission and what Chair Gensler is saying. I don't know, if you heard former SEC Chair, Jay Layton yesterday, who was asked about this as well. And we agree with the sentiment there that payment for order flow and the current structure that's allowed has provided a great all-in cost of execution for retail investors, one that's, in fact, unmatched in history. And we've got retail customers are getting a great deal. So I mean, we're a little bit concerned. Obviously, we're flying with things improving. But yes, we think that the barrier making changes in this extremely complicated setup has to be quite high given that retail customers are getting great execution quality right now. On \u2013 in terms of what it would do to our business, again, we're paying attention to it, equities payment for order flow right now comprises about 9% of our total revenues. So we've seen better diversification Q2 versus Q1. More of our revenue is driven by net interest income and equities payment for order flow even within the transaction segment has been on a downward trend. So certainly, 9% is significant. But I think all in all, we feel pretty comfortable that we're giving customers a great deal. And over time, you should see our revenues continue to diversify as we roll out more products.\nRichard Repetto: Got it. That's very helpful, Vlad. Thank you. And my follow-up would be \u2013 this is following up from a previous question earlier, but it's on the M&A front. And I know that question asked about specific companies. But I'm just trying to get your broader thoughts given the share \u2013 the control of the shares, the voting power. Would there be any scenario where you could see a partner that, again, may not be an acquisition, but could get you to the immediacy of product development and \u2013 enrich the progress that you're trying to make, I guess, do you envision any scenario, or is that just not really in the cards at this point?\nVlad Tenev: Rich, I mean, as I mentioned before, if I look at Robinhood right now, I think we're incredibly well positioned to continue to execute on our plans as a standalone independent company. We've got $6 billion in cash. We've made great progress towards both increasing revenues and decreasing costs. And I think, in particular, in these environments, great companies that are in our position have been able to set themselves up for the future, just taking advantage of opportunities that are out there for acquisitions and M&A. So I think we see an opportunity actually to use our balance sheet and our financial strength to accelerate our own road map. And that's how we've been thinking about it and approaching our strategy.\nRichard Repetto: Understood. Just the companies that made it through the Internet. When the Internet bubble broke, we're the one that has stayed focused flat. So, thanks for the answer. \nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to touch upon the net new deposits, which continue to hold up quite strong despite the challenging environment. So I was hoping you could provide some color around that, including maybe touching upon the profile of the customers that are driving the M&A versus the installed base. How much of the M&A relates to recurring preset contributions? And how much of that is going into the cash management program.\nJason Warnick: Yes. So I'll go ahead and start, and Vlad you can feel free to add some color. So we feel really good. We increased the interest rate that we're offering to our customers in the cash sweep program. That's now at 1%, and we've got about $2 billion of customer cash there. So, offering a really nice value proposition. In terms of the net deposits, $5.2 billion during the quarter, a 22% annualized growth rate in terms of net deposits relative to the beginning of period AUC. So, really strong indication that our customers, even in this tough environment are continuing to engage and putting their money to work for the long-term. In terms of customer cohorts, we haven't provided the breakout detail between the various cohorts in terms of net deposits. What I'd tell you is that there's a broad participation of where the net deposits are coming from, including from the installed base, the net increase in our funded accounts has been modest these last couple of quarters. So I'd point more to our installed base. But we do like what we're seeing from the new investors that are joining the platform and I think we're really well positioned for them to grow with us.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. And the only thing I would add to that is some of the things on the near-term road map that we've mentioned before, in particular, retirement accounts and making improvements for our more advanced customers we think those will drive meaningful net deposit increases over time as well.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And just a follow-up question regarding the $6 billion cash position that you flagged that you have on the balance sheet. I guess the question here is just how much do you need to run the business in terms of cash versus? How much is excess that might be available for M&A that you were mentioning before that you may have some interest in? And I also saw you mentioned about $2.5 billion of excess above risk scenario, but I think that includes your $3 billion lines of credit, so that would suggest no excess in a risk scenario. So I was just hoping you can elaborate around what that risk scenario is and how to think about that?\nJason Warnick: So in our risk scenarios, we have $2.5 billion of excess cash. So that is just excess. And on a typical day, we're using very little of our corporate cash to run the business. We've just had periods of time in the past where -- for example, the main stock rally, we saw moments where there was extreme volatility and that caused the risk scenarios that we are modeling today. And that's what I'm referring to, moments like that, where we continue to have in excess, $2.5 billion above scenarios that resemble what we saw back then.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hey. Good afternoon, Vlad. Good afternoon, Jason.\nVlad Tenev: Hi, Steven.\nSteven Chubak: I wanted to start off with a question on stock-based comp. Jason, you made some earlier comments just highlighting your internal focus to rein in future dilution. And I was hoping you could help us size the incremental dilution associated with the share-based comp that's not yet been recognized. And given your strong excess liquidity position, I heard the earlier comment on capital management, but any potential plans to offset that future dilution with incremental buybacks?\nJason Warnick: Yes. We don't have plans right now to implement a share buyback plan. As I mentioned in my earlier comment to the say question, we think that will be a more appropriate as we turn the corner on profitability. In terms of unrecognized share-based compensation, we just filed our 10-Q this afternoon. I think that number is in the queue. I don't have it top of mind, but the unrecognized is in there. And then just to reiterate that about half of our share based compensation is from the pre-IPO market based awards that were given to the founders. And those vest a significantly higher dollar share prices than where we're at today.\nSteven Chubak: Thanks for that. And for my follow-up, just on the NII sensitivity. You spoke of the $40 million benefit per rate hike, just given the sheer number of hikes we've seen so far, the NII expansion in 2Q, certainly healthy, you cited a record, but it was a bit lighter than we had anticipated. I recognize there are a lot of moving pieces impacting the sensitivity. Thought it might be helpful, Jason, if you could just speak to the sensitivity across the different buckets, margin balances, web cash, corporate cash, that's underpinning some of that $40 million per hike guidance that you offered up.\nJason Warnick: Yes. We're actually really pleased with the pass-through that we've seen from our banking partners on these rates so far and pretty optimistic that we'll continue to see good results from there. Margin balances, we have increased. As Vlad mentioned, we've also separated it from gold, offering customers who are not part of gold to participate in the margin program, but at higher rates. And in terms of kind of go-forward guidance, what I would just say is that we'll continue to see a meaningful portion of these rates accrued to shareholders, but balanced by our intention to also offer just great value for customers.\nSteven Chubak: That\u2019s great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nJason Warnick: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for next question. Next question will come from the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nWill Nance: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask another question on the expense base and follow up on the earlier question on stock-based comp as well. The -- given the moving pieces in the expense base, a handful of restructuring charges in the back half, Jason, I'm wondering if you could talk for both, kind of, like, OpEx and the SBC lines. As you look out into 2023, what's the exit run rate some of these line items? And I guess, particularly on SBC, if you do -- if you have an exit run rate for us, is that 50% level that impacts ongoing dilution still going to be the right number for the foreseeable future?\nJason Warnick: Yes. I think there's a couple of things that I can say that will be helpful, but we haven't provided guidance on exit run rates. The stock-based comp for the market-based awards that were given pre-IPO to the founders, that is recognized on an accelerated basis. And so, that will decline over time, recognizing more in earlier periods and less in later periods. Also, as we hit those share prices, it will cause an acceleration of the related tranches that are affected by that. So it will be accelerated and also potentially lumpy as we hit those triggers. Really proud of the team, both on OpEx, primarily on OpEx, both for third-party spend in particular, making great progress, a lot of collaboration across the teams. One area to highlight is the focus that our engineering team has had on improving our efficient use of our web hosting. But we've got lots of examples kind of across the company of just driving improvements, all reflected in the pretty favorable incremental guidance that we gave in our release.\nWill Nance: Got it. I appreciate that. And then, just kind of a nuanced question on the transaction revenues. I think the implied take rate on the cryptocurrency trading this quarter, I think it was up sequentially versus the first quarter of this year. I know you guys obviously renegotiated at the beginning of the year, but anything to call out on what drove the higher spread this quarter?\nJason Warnick: Yes. We were able to achieve a higher negotiated rate than what we had previously. It is disclosed on our app and website. We took it from kind of low 20s to now, its 35 basis points.\nWill Nance: Got it. Super helpful. Appreciate, you taking all my questions.\nJason Warnick: Yes. You bet, Will. Thanks, Will.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment of our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Josh Beck from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.\nJosh Beck: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I was just kind of curious when we think about ARPU and where it can go in the midterm. Obviously, with the current macro kind of stable, what would be the key drivers that we should be focused on in terms of trying to build out scenarios on kind of where that metric could go over time?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, I'll go ahead and take it, and then Vlad can jump in. What we're really focused on is improving the user experience. Vlad mentioned a couple of things around the brokerage user experience. We're continuing to add new coins for crypto in a very diligent way and also looking to new products that we roll out fully paid securities lending, which we recently rolled out. We're seeing really nice early traction with $3 billion of equities under management that are already enrolled. The Cash Card is another area. It's a new product and one that we're really excited about improving the user experience. And then, of course, we're going to see some benefit from the rising interest rate. A couple of the rate hikes that happened in Q2 happened late in the quarter, and you'll begin to see that flow through at a higher rate in Q3. So I think we like our focus on user experience and new products and expect that that's going to begin to show through in our financials over time.\nJosh Beck: Thanks. And I had a follow-up. Certainly, the market conditions have been challenging for everyone. Obviously, you did raise a substantial amount of capital and do have certainly leading scale. So I'm just curious, when you think about the competitive environment and particularly maybe some of the lower scaled companies, perhaps with less funding, if you have seen any changes maybe on the customer acquisition or front or anything else notable there?\nJason Warnick: I'd say that, overall customer acquisition is lower right now in periods of more market enthusiasm. We found that customer acquisition comes a little easier. And right now, it's a little lower. We've pulled back on marketing. We found that chasing growth in this environment doesn't have the same ROI is in periods where you have higher intent customers. So it's \u2013 it continues to be competitive. We continue to work on kind of the inputs of customer experience, and we expect that at some point, hopefully soon, we'll work our way through this cycle.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I'd just add that, I think historically, Robin Hood has been a company that has focused a lot on new customer acquisition. And we probably focused historically, again, a little bit less on the customers that we've already had. This year, I think, has been a really healthy focus on valuable customers that have grown with us and have been using the platform quite a bit. And improving the customer experience for our most advanced customers and the people that we already had, we think has been very, very valuable. And you'll see that pay dividends for the business. But it is cyclical and as time goes on, I would expect that shift \u2013 that mix to shift. And we would definitely see opportunities over the long run to reaccelerate new customer acquisition.\nJosh Beck: Very helpful. Thanks, Jason, Vlad. \nJason Warnick: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Your line is open. \nBenjamin Budish: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first on the fully paid securities lending. You mentioned, I think, $3 billion in eligible balances. I'm just wondering, given the revenue share you got with customers that opt in and the target of one time to two times the size of your margin-based securities lending revenues. How big do you think that needs to be to kind of hit that goal?\nJason Warnick: It's early. I don't know offhand if we have shared the revenue split, I don't believe so. So I'm not going to lean into that particular aspect of your question. It's early. We've got about $50 billion of equities under management today. $3 billion of that is enrolled. The teams are hard at work at making sure our customers are aware of the program, aware of the way that they can increase their passive income by participating in the program, and we like the growth that we're seeing kind of on a weekly basis and look forward to updating you. But it's early, and we've got a ways to go before it reaches that potential.\nBenjamin Budish: Okay. That's fair enough. And then maybe one for Vlad. You mentioned that, kind of, another M&A question. You mentioned that you see yourselves as more of an acquirer than an acquiree. Could you maybe talk about what your priorities may be? Would it be more things like Ziglu where you're looking at international expansion or product expansion, or I don't know, kind of -- that's the general question though.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. I'd say international, as you mentioned, with Ziglu is definitely something we've looked at in the past and we'll continue to explore. The other area is just opportunities for us to take advantage of our large scale in terms of customers and plug in new products and new services and assets that our customers would find valuable, particularly, those trading at attractive good businesses -- trading at attractive valuations, which you can find in environments like this.\nBenjamin Budish: Sure. Understood. Thanks for taking the question.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our last question for today will be from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is open. \nKen Worthington: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Vlad, in the S-1, the mission statement was the democratization of finance for all. As we've been running the numbers, we see that your clients have pretty significantly underperformed since the mean bubble burst in both up and down markets even when accounting for crypto and growth. So two questions around this. Can Robinhood do better for its customers and drive better performance results for them? And if so, how do you get there? What tools do they need? And how long it -- will it take? And I would say things like Cash Card and the wallet and retirement accounts to stock lending are all interesting and probably you'll see big demand, but it doesn't seem like they address the key issue of underperformance. And then as we think about driving better performance for the end customers, can you do it in a way, given your customer asset levels in a way that's profitable for Robinhood and your shareholders?\nVlad Tenev: Yes, I think -- thanks for the question. It's always hard to have a very short-term view on this. I mean, when you look at performance kind of right in the depths of crypto winter and after a bear market that's hit technology and innovation, particularly hard, I think you'll get a skewed results. But over the long run, we believe in innovation. We believe in technology. We believe that these customers who -- many of whom are at the beginning of their financial journeys and are starting relatively younger than previous generations have with investing, we'll end up doing quite well because the American economy, the engines of innovation in the short-term, you might have bear markets, but over the long run, we think that they'll do quite well. So we're very, very committed to providing the best tools for our customers to benefit from these markets and make it easier to invest. I don't think that a bear market should call our mission into question. I think the mission is incredibly important. And bear markets are opportunities that investors, particularly wealthy ones have used to set themselves up for long-term success. And I think it's very, very important for us to offer these services to not just the wealthy.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. And then just maybe a data question. How much -- or how many gold accounts, cash cards non-custodial wallets on the waitlist. Where do those numbers sort of stand as of the end of the second quarter?\nJason Warnick : So sorry, go ahead and repeat that list again for me, Ken.\nKen Worthington: Yes. I'm sorry. And I apologize. I tried to go through the -- or the queue, I didn't see anything. Gold accounts, cash cards and the non-custodial wallet waitlist.\nJason Warnick : Yes. We have about a 6% attach rate on gold. Cash Card, it's early. We haven't said the number of users at this point. What we're focused on really right now is just improving the user experience. Last week, for example, we've rolled out merchant incentives, which gives customers cash back on spending their card at places like gas stations, pizza parlors and so on, which we think is great for customers. So what we're really focused on is improving user experience, improving the value proposition. And then just getting the word out, finding ways within the app and otherwise, there are questions about marketing earlier to get the word out to customers about the products that we have and the great value proposition that we have for them.\nVlad Tenev : And I think on the non-custodial wallet, that wait list number is actually public on the website. And I believe it recently crossed 1 million.\nJason Warnick : Yes. Thanks for your questions, Ken, and thanks to everyone for questions today.\nVlad Tenev : Yes. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, for that great introduction, and thanks to everyone for joining. Last week was the one-year anniversary of our IPO and in the 12 months since we've had to navigate two challenges, one is adapting to the public markets, and two of also dealing with an abrupt reversal of the macro environment. For our customers, many of whom are younger, it looks like they may be facing a recession for the first time in their adult lives if the last two quarters of negative GDP growth or any indication. Customers are seeing this high inflation along with high interest rates, bear markets and stocks and a crypto winter. And this all adds up to less money to spend and therefore, less to save and invest. You can also see this reflected in the drop in assets under custody that we reported. Despite strong net deposits of over $5 billion in Q2, you can see that our assets under custody dropped. And this shows that customers have been hurt by devaluation across crypto currencies and growth stocks in particular. And while we can't control the macro environment, we've been hard at work building products to help our customers navigate it. Products like the Cash Card, Stock Lending and high yield on their uninvested cash. I'd have to say 2022 is by far our most prolific year yet of delivering products to customers, and we've got much more in the works. For Robinhood in the seven or so years since we first launched in the US, we've consistently adapted to changes improved and become more robust and resilient as a company. If we're headed into our first recession in the company's history, we recognize it would be a challenging time, but strong companies use these times as opportunities, and we look forward to navigating through this environment and coming out even stronger. To that end, we made a tough call to further reduce our staff, which we announced the details of yesterday. These are hard decisions, but we believe they better position our business for the long term. So alongside the reduction in force, we organized the company into a general manager structure for each of our core business units. We've been thinking about this change for some time, and I'm confident that it will speed up decision-making, increase accountability. And ultimately, it will help us deliver even faster for our customers. This is just one part of our leaner operating model, and Jason will share more color on this in his remarks. Now onto the quarter. Despite the environment weakening, we were able to both increase our revenues and lower our expenses in Q2 compared to Q1. Now this was a company-wide effort, and I am proud of the team for the hard work and dedication it took to get here. It certainly wasn't easy. We believe we're making swift progress toward our goal of being adjusted EBITDA positive by the end of the year. So let's move on and talk a little bit about our product road map. Remember, our goal is to deliver low-cost, simple products and a safe customer experience that give everyday people control over their finances and access to the same tools that wealthy people have enjoyed for generations. We've organized our efforts into three product areas: brokerage, crypto and money. So I'd like to review each of those with you. Let's start with brokerage. To put things in perspective, Robinhood is the most downloaded brokerage you have in the US. We achieved this leadership position by aggressively innovating, which in turn fueled our account and asset growth. To continue driving growth, we have focused our brokerage product development this year on two key areas: one, introducing retirement accounts; and the second, improving our customer experience, particularly for advanced customers. So starting with retirement accounts, I can't tell you how excited we are about this product. We feel like we've come up with a way to offer retirement that is uniquely Robinhood, and we know our customers will love it as much as we do. We're piloting them now with plans to launch later this year. Additionally, retirement accounts will be the first time our customers will be able to have multiple brokerage accounts with us. We think this creates a big opportunity for us to broaden our support for and deepen our relationships with our customers over time. It's also a new avenue for us to drive account and asset growth and increase our total share of wallet. Next, let's turn to our advanced customers. In Q1, we extended market hours. So customers now have more flexibility to trade when they want and customers have now traded over $9 billion in volume during these additional hours. Extending trading hours we view as the first step towards 24/7 stock trading, and we are making progress towards making this a reality. In Q2, we also rolled out fully paid securities lending to give customers another source of passive income on their stocks, which is especially important in the current environment. We're encouraged to see the early progress with over $3 billion of equity value already enrolled and available to lend. We've also been making a ton of improvements to our options product. We believe our options offering is the lowest cost and best user experience offering out there. Most of our competitors say they're zero commissions, but they, in fact, charge a $0.65 commission for every contract treated, which is $65 for a $100 contract trade, which are $0 per contract. Recently, we've added options in cash accounts, which has been a top requested feature by our actions customers. We've also been doing a ton of in-person research with this group, and we recognize they care a lot about advanced charting on the platform. So we're making our charting and technical indicators much better, and there is plenty more to come. Keep the feedback coming. Our team has been working tirelessly to make Robinhood by far, the best place to trade. Now, let's turn to our crypto efforts. Our vision with crypto is to be the most trusted platform for customers to invest in crypto as well as the most trusted on-ramp to the decentralized web. That is why after first introducing crypto investing in 2018, we've been relentlessly focused on three things: providing the best value, the best user experience and being the safest. So, let me tell you what we are delivering for customers in crypto by highlighting two areas that we've been working on this year, adding more coins and giving customers more control over their crypto. Starting with coins. Customers tell us that they want us to introduce more coins onto the platform. Some other crypto providers have come under scrutiny for listing unregistered securities on their platforms. This can be dangerous and misleading for customers, because they may expect these cryptos to be more decentralized than they really are. We employ a rigorous listing framework, which in the short-term may feel like we aren't moving fast enough. But we think this approach will pay off in the long-term. Frankly, one of the benefits of being heavily regulated and a US-based company is that it has helped us learn how to build with customer safety in mind. So far in a deliberate and considered manner, we have introduced a number of new coins this year, and customers have been pleased with the offerings to date. Turning to our efforts to give customers more control over their crypto. In April, we launched our crypto wallet. So customers can move their crypto in and out of Robinhood in a simple, safe and seamless way. We've heard feedback that customers want faster withdrawals and larger daily limits. So we raised our withdrawal limits from $3,000 to $5,000 per day and are working on improving this even more. Later this year, we will be rolling out our non-custodial wallets. This will be a separate stand-alone app, where customers can trade and swap crypto with no network fees and maintain full custody of their crypto throughout, all with the simplicity and great user experience they have come to expect from Robinhood. We're seeing good interest as our non-custodial wait list continues to grow, and our early internal version of the product looks awesome. We think customers are going to love it. Okay. Let's now move to our product development efforts related to Robinhood Money, which includes our new cash card. We hear from customers that they want to start saving and investing, but the current environment is hard with inflation and high gas prices. We want to help them by giving them a good way to build saving and investing habits even in the current environment. And to that end, in March, we launched the new Robinhood Cash Card. Customers are using the card to make day-to-day purchases and round up their spare change into stocks, ETFs and crypto. And of course, not only are we not charging any monthly fees for this, but we're actually matching a portion of their roundups to help them build their portfolios. So, it's a fantastic value for customers. And we've been pleased with the week-over-week growth and the cohort retention we've been seeing. Since launch, we've been making steady improvements to the user experience as well. And last week, we started rolling out cash back offers that select merchants, including on gas, doing our part to help customers with these high gas prices. We believe we have a huge opportunity to become the primary place where customers deposit their paychecks, which drive their spending and investing. And while it's still early, we're excited about our potential to grow this offering with both existing and new customers and drive additional customer loyalty as well as revenue diversification over time. Now, before passing it over to Jason, I wanted to reiterate how extremely proud I am of all the progress we've made over the past quarter, with the new products we've shipped and the work we've done to improve the experience for our customers. And when I look ahead, I feel even better positioned to execute on our roadmap and serve our customers. And with that, let me turn it over to Jason. Yes, I'll take it. Thanks, [indiscernible] for the question. And it's good seeing you up here with top-loaded questions quarter after quarter. So on gold for shareholders, we don't have plans to offer that right now and to bundle gold with shareholder status, but I do want to touch on rewards to shareholders and Robinhood gold briefly. So on the first, you might have seen that, say, which we're all using for this Q&A, launched a product called Otway recently. So this will actually allow us to work with our corporate partners to identify shareholders and offer them perks and rewards. This is a first-of-its-kind offering, really allowing public companies to identify their shareholders. And we're excited to have Tesla being the first partner with us. But we think this is something that that more companies should be doing and we'd like to -- we're happy to offer the technology to make that easier for them. Now on the gold side, we think there's tremendous value in gold. And we've got a team of people hard at work to provide even more value. And we want goal to be so valuable that it's a no-brainer for all of our customers to be gold customers.\nA \u2013 Chris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. So the next question is on the M&A front. So any word on being acquired by FTX or Charles Schwab?\nA \u2013 Vlad Tenev: Sure. I'll take this one. So, in one word, no. I think we're in a great position as a stand-alone company. I love us as a stand-alone company. We've got a strong balance sheet. We've got an awesome team, and we're delivering on our product road map, as I mentioned, at a pace that we haven't seen before. So actually, I'd flip it on the other side. We actually see opportunities particularly in this market environment to leverage the balance sheet that we have, that's about $6 billion to acquire companies that can help us accelerate our road map. So we continue to be on the lookout there. And we remain, really excited by the opportunity we see ahead of us.\nA \u2013 Chris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Vlad. And thanks, Paul for asking that question. The next question is also from Mr. John P [ph] who asks -- also on the M&A front. Can you provide us with an update on the Ziglu acquisition and strategic plan for international expansion for this year?\nA \u2013 Vlad Tenev: Sure. And Sean John, I think I also missed the second part of your question before about advanced trading. So advanced charts is something that we've heard from customers about, and we've got some good tools for you in the works. So just stay tuned. We hope to -- we think you'll really love them. On the Ziglu acquisition and strategic plan for international expansion, so as we mentioned in the last call, we had entered into an agreement to acquire Ziglu. Now these agreements take normally a little while to close. So we're going through that process right now. And we're still on track to close by the end of the year. And I'm very excited, to bring Mark and the team on board and accelerate our entry into the UK and the rest of Europe. So very, very excited about that. And hopefully, it goes smoothly, we believe it will.\nA \u2013 Chris Koegel: All right. Next question is from MJS [ph], who asks -- or states that the five-year historical charts don't seem good enough. And can we do more MAX like others?\nA \u2013 Vlad Tenev: Yes. Thank you for that feedback. I always love hearing, feedback about the tools. We hear customers loud and clear, that they want better charting, more flexibility, more advanced charting, and more data. So we've been making lots of improvements to our offerings and charting will continue to get better and better. So just stay tuned. We've got some good stuff in the works for you. Yes, I'll fill that as well. Thanks, Andrew, for the question. So earlier this year, we announced our goal of making equity markets accessible 24/7, we think that it's actually silly that with all the technology we have nowadays, US equity markets are still tied to East Coast, United States working hours. So as the first step of that process, we extended our already extended trading hours to 4:00 a.m. Pacific to 5:00 p.m. Pacific. So that's 7:00 to 8:00 Eastern. The goal is to make that 24/7 along the way we might see opportunities depending on customer interest to make incremental progress and add more hours, which we'll certainly pursue and consider. So adding 4:00 a.m to 7:00 a.m. Eastern, I believe, is certainly something we're thinking about. Yes, I'll fill this one as well. Thank you, Anthony. So we already do provide a form of this. So in our margin offering, we allow customers to get a loan against their assets already within Robinhood. And we're actually -- previously, this offering was only available to Robinhood Gold customers, but we're actually making it available to all customers under different rates. So this will allow you, if you have over $2,000 in securities to borrow against them, you can either use that to buy more securities or even withdraw to your bank account or spend it through the Robinhood spending account and Cash Card. So yes, it's a very useful service. A lot of customers don't know that you can actually withdraw against your margin loan and get some liquidity without selling securities. So we'll definitely look to communicate that a little bit better and also looking at different ways to help customers generate some more liquidity, especially in this environment going forward. Hi, Devin. Yes, I'll field that. I think historically, Robinhood has been very much driven by word-of-mouth growth and even the marketing expense that we accrued through 2021 in large part was as a result of our referral program. We did do a little bit of brand marketing as well, but I think performance and referral program were largely driving 2021. And as the environment has, kind of, changed through 2022, we've been heads down focusing on products and improving the service quality. But we actually do see an opportunity to get the word out and do more brand marketing and make it clear to customers what Robinhood stands for and our mission and our position in the segment, as you point out. So Yes, I would expect to see a little bit more on the brand side and on the performance, as I'm sure Jason can add, we're very much focused on efficiency. And we think that organic and referral-based marketing is -- is kind of the best way, and we'll see that pick up as the macro environment changes and as we continue to improve our products. Yeah. Yeah, sure, Rich. I mean, I think the first thing to say is, we're obviously paying close attention to what's coming out of the commission and what Chair Gensler is saying. I don't know, if you heard former SEC Chair, Jay Layton yesterday, who was asked about this as well. And we agree with the sentiment there that payment for order flow and the current structure that's allowed has provided a great all-in cost of execution for retail investors, one that's, in fact, unmatched in history. And we've got retail customers are getting a great deal. So I mean, we're a little bit concerned. Obviously, we're flying with things improving. But yes, we think that the barrier making changes in this extremely complicated setup has to be quite high given that retail customers are getting great execution quality right now. On \u2013 in terms of what it would do to our business, again, we're paying attention to it, equities payment for order flow right now comprises about 9% of our total revenues. So we've seen better diversification Q2 versus Q1. More of our revenue is driven by net interest income and equities payment for order flow even within the transaction segment has been on a downward trend. So certainly, 9% is significant. But I think all in all, we feel pretty comfortable that we're giving customers a great deal. And over time, you should see our revenues continue to diversify as we roll out more products. Rich, I mean, as I mentioned before, if I look at Robinhood right now, I think we're incredibly well positioned to continue to execute on our plans as a standalone independent company. We've got $6 billion in cash. We've made great progress towards both increasing revenues and decreasing costs. And I think, in particular, in these environments, great companies that are in our position have been able to set themselves up for the future, just taking advantage of opportunities that are out there for acquisitions and M&A. So I think we see an opportunity actually to use our balance sheet and our financial strength to accelerate our own road map. And that's how we've been thinking about it and approaching our strategy. Thanks, Rich. Yes. And the only thing I would add to that is some of the things on the near-term road map that we've mentioned before, in particular, retirement accounts and making improvements for our more advanced customers we think those will drive meaningful net deposit increases over time as well. Hi, Steven. Yeah. I'd just add that, I think historically, Robin Hood has been a company that has focused a lot on new customer acquisition. And we probably focused historically, again, a little bit less on the customers that we've already had. This year, I think, has been a really healthy focus on valuable customers that have grown with us and have been using the platform quite a bit. And improving the customer experience for our most advanced customers and the people that we already had, we think has been very, very valuable. And you'll see that pay dividends for the business. But it is cyclical and as time goes on, I would expect that shift \u2013 that mix to shift. And we would definitely see opportunities over the long run to reaccelerate new customer acquisition. Yes. I'd say international, as you mentioned, with Ziglu is definitely something we've looked at in the past and we'll continue to explore. The other area is just opportunities for us to take advantage of our large scale in terms of customers and plug in new products and new services and assets that our customers would find valuable, particularly, those trading at attractive good businesses -- trading at attractive valuations, which you can find in environments like this. Thank you. Yes, I think -- thanks for the question. It's always hard to have a very short-term view on this. I mean, when you look at performance kind of right in the depths of crypto winter and after a bear market that's hit technology and innovation, particularly hard, I think you'll get a skewed results. But over the long run, we believe in innovation. We believe in technology. We believe that these customers who -- many of whom are at the beginning of their financial journeys and are starting relatively younger than previous generations have with investing, we'll end up doing quite well because the American economy, the engines of innovation in the short-term, you might have bear markets, but over the long run, we think that they'll do quite well. So we're very, very committed to providing the best tools for our customers to benefit from these markets and make it easier to invest. I don't think that a bear market should call our mission into question. I think the mission is incredibly important. And bear markets are opportunities that investors, particularly wealthy ones have used to set themselves up for long-term success. And I think it's very, very important for us to offer these services to not just the wealthy. And I think on the non-custodial wallet, that wait list number is actually public on the website. And I believe it recently crossed 1 million. Yes. Thank you, guys."

            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. In the second quarter, we remain focused on serving our customers, growing our business and driving long-term shareholder value. While the environment was volatile, net funded accounts were steady and net deposits were strong. And the combined strength of our team, platform and balance sheet positioned us to continue delivering on our 2022 product road map. I'm also pleased that we've increased our productivity and efficiency, driving improvements to adjusted EBITDA from Q1. We've made great progress so far this year, and I'm energized by the opportunities to drive value for our customers and shareholders going forward. Before we review our Q2 results, I'd like to share some context for the August workforce reduction that we announced yesterday. Since we spoke last quarter, we've continued to aggressively execute on our product road map and serve our customers while working hard to get to a leaner operating model, including by slowing our hiring and significantly lowering third-party spend, but the macro environment has continued to soften, inflation is at a four-year high, and our customers are experiencing bare markets and equities and crypto. It's clear we needed to do more to manage our costs. And so yesterday, we announced a 23% reduction from current levels to a headcount of approximately 2,600. At this new level, we believe we are appropriately staffed to be cost efficient, while continuing to deliver great service and innovation for our customers. To be clear, even with this reduction, we believe we are well positioned to continue delivering on our road map. With that context in mind, let's review the second quarter, starting with our business results. Net funded accounts were $22.9 million in Q2, up $100,000 from the prior quarter and notably steady given the current environment. Looking at monthly active users, they were $14 million in Q2, while this is down $1.9 million from Q1, we are encouraged by our continued industry-leading engagement through a volatile quarter. Turning to assets under custody. They were $64 billion in Q2, down 31% from last quarter. While funded accounts continue to grow and customers continue to make net deposits through the volatile environment, Assets under custody declined along with decreases in market valuations, especially for high-growth stocks and cryptocurrencies. Looking at July, it's encouraging to see that customer assets increased back over $70 billion as markets rebounded. Looking more closely at net deposits. They were $5.2 billion in Q2, which translates to a 22% annualized growth rate relative to Q1 assets under custody. So while assets were lower in Q2, if we think about our long-term potential for asset growth, we believe the combination of strong net deposits and long-term rising markets can drive meaningful asset growth over time. Now let's turn to our Q2 financial results, which reflect good progress on increasing profitability. Adjusted EBITDA improved $63 million sequentially to negative $80 million in Q2. This improvement was driven by revenue growth and expense discipline that drove operating leverage. Looking ahead, we continue to push towards a positive adjusted EBITDA run rate by the end of the year. This goal is an important step along the way to delivering higher levels of profitability over time. We feel that our progress over the past quarter has better positioned us to reach our goal by year-end, which will take continued improvements in both revenue and costs. So let's start with revenues. Total net revenues were $318 million in Q2. This was a 6% increase from Q1, primarily driven by higher net interest and other revenues, partially offset by lower transaction revenues. Q2 total revenue translates to ARPU of $56, up from $53 last quarter. Now moving to transaction-based revenues. They were $202 million in Q2, down 7% sequentially. The decrease was primarily driven by lower trading volumes consistent with the macro environment. And turning to net interest revenues. As we've discussed in the past, we believe that over the long-term, interest income will drive a larger portion of our revenue. That is why we're encouraged that Q2 net interest revenues reached a new high of $74 million and drove nearly a quarter of total Q2 revenues. The 35% increase from Q1 was primarily due to the March and June Fed rate hikes, partially offset by lower margin balances. I'd also note that interest-earning assets, which are comprised of customer cash, corporate cash and margin balances were $16 billion at the end of Q2. This includes customer cash sweep balances, earning 1%, which totaled over $2 billion in Q2. As we look ahead, interest rates are widely expected to continue rising, which would drive meaningful additional revenue from our interest-earning assets. One way to see that benefit is to look at our recent experience from the June and July Fed rate hikes that totaled 150 basis points. On average, we estimate that we are realizing about $40 million of annualized run rate revenue per 25 basis points of rate hike given our current balances and customer rates. Of course, the precise benefit of rate hikes will depend on how the benefit of rate hikes will depend on how balances and customer rates vary over time. Moving on to other revenues. They were $42 million in Q2, up 62% from Q1 primarily due to the seasonal increase in proxy-related revenues. Together, net interest and other revenue made up 36% of total revenue in Q2, up from 27% in Q1, continuing to broaden our product offering can help us further diversify our revenues going forward. Let's now look at our Q2 expenses, starting with operating expenses prior to share-based compensation. They were $446 million in Q2, which includes $17 million of severance related to our April workforce reduction. This was an improvement of $24 million or 5% from Q1, reflecting our work to be more cost efficient including with third parties. Given this progress on our ongoing expenses and our August workforce reduction, we're lowering our full year expense outlook. Our updated outlook for 2022 operating expenses prior to share-based compensation is a range of $1.7 billion to $1.76 billion, which would be a year-over-year decline of 7% to 10% in operating costs. This updated outlook includes the cost of an estimated $45 million to $60 million of severance and restructuring expenses related to our August workforce reduction. Turning to share-based compensation expense, which, as a reminder, reflects the number of shares and our share price at the time the awards were granted. It was $164 million in Q2, down by $56 million or 25% from Q1. The decrease was primarily driven by a $24 million reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation related to our April workforce reduction and a reduced pace of hiring this year. I'd also highlight that 50% of our Q2 expense was driven by pre-IPO market-based awards for our two founders that will vest only as our share price reaches levels from $50 to $300, but are recognized on a GAAP basis as expenses over time. These awards won't increase our share count until our share price appreciates considerably, which would be a great outcome for shareholders. As for our 2022 outlook for share-based compensation, we are lowering our expense outlook for the year. We now anticipate 2022 share-based compensation expense to be in the range of $760 million to $840 million, down between 47% to 52% from prior year levels. This updated outlook includes the benefit of an estimated $40 million to $50 million reversal of previously recognized share-based compensation related to our August workforce reduction. I also want to highlight that given our reduced pace of hiring and workforce reductions, we are now on a significantly lower trajectory of diluted share count growth than we have seen over the past year. While we believe that it's important to align the interest of employees with shareholders, this will be an area we will be managing closely. Now, let's turn to capital management. In the current environment, it's even more important to have a strong balance sheet and cash position. That is why we like our position with no debt and $6 billion of corporate cash on hand that provides strength, flexibility and financial runway to continue serving our customers, executing on our product roadmap, and evaluating potential acquisitions. As I mentioned last quarter, we have roughly $2.5 billion of excess cash above our risk scenarios. In closing, we continue to make good progress in Q2 and we're very optimistic about the opportunities ahead of us to deliver value for customers and shareholders. With that, Chris, let's move to Q&A. Thanks for each of those questions. We think the best use of our cash right now is to fund the business, both our organic initiatives to drive growth as well as potentially to use for acquisitions. I think a better time to be thinking for us to be thinking about returns of cash to shareholders is when we reach some goals further down the line around generating positive adjusted EBITDA and kicking off positive cash flow. But I appreciate the question. Hi, Devin. Good afternoon. As you think about modeling this, we'd expect marketing expense to increase in the back half of the year. It's incorporated in the guidance that we provided. Yes. Devin, we do follow a Power law here. So the more active customers do drive more of the revenue versus the less active customers, and that's been true for some time. In terms of predicting the bottom, it is hard to predict. The market, the first half of the year has been about the worst that we've seen in about 50 years. Hard to know exactly when it's going to bottom out and turn around. I think we saw some life in July more broadly in the market, so that's an encouraging sign. And I commented in my prepared remarks about the effect it had on our customers rebound in assets under custody. What we are focusing on right now is just continuing to improve the user experience. I do think personally, this is a cycle, and we're in a cycle, other cycles will come long-term. I'm very optimistic that it's going to be great for retail investors to continue to invest in the stock market and participate in wealth building over the long-term. Thanks, Devin. Yes. So I'll go ahead and start, and Vlad you can feel free to add some color. So we feel really good. We increased the interest rate that we're offering to our customers in the cash sweep program. That's now at 1%, and we've got about $2 billion of customer cash there. So, offering a really nice value proposition. In terms of the net deposits, $5.2 billion during the quarter, a 22% annualized growth rate in terms of net deposits relative to the beginning of period AUC. So, really strong indication that our customers, even in this tough environment are continuing to engage and putting their money to work for the long-term. In terms of customer cohorts, we haven't provided the breakout detail between the various cohorts in terms of net deposits. What I'd tell you is that there's a broad participation of where the net deposits are coming from, including from the installed base, the net increase in our funded accounts has been modest these last couple of quarters. So I'd point more to our installed base. But we do like what we're seeing from the new investors that are joining the platform and I think we're really well positioned for them to grow with us. So in our risk scenarios, we have $2.5 billion of excess cash. So that is just excess. And on a typical day, we're using very little of our corporate cash to run the business. We've just had periods of time in the past where -- for example, the main stock rally, we saw moments where there was extreme volatility and that caused the risk scenarios that we are modeling today. And that's what I'm referring to, moments like that, where we continue to have in excess, $2.5 billion above scenarios that resemble what we saw back then. Thanks, Michael. Yes. We don't have plans right now to implement a share buyback plan. As I mentioned in my earlier comment to the say question, we think that will be a more appropriate as we turn the corner on profitability. In terms of unrecognized share-based compensation, we just filed our 10-Q this afternoon. I think that number is in the queue. I don't have it top of mind, but the unrecognized is in there. And then just to reiterate that about half of our share based compensation is from the pre-IPO market based awards that were given to the founders. And those vest a significantly higher dollar share prices than where we're at today. Yes. We're actually really pleased with the pass-through that we've seen from our banking partners on these rates so far and pretty optimistic that we'll continue to see good results from there. Margin balances, we have increased. As Vlad mentioned, we've also separated it from gold, offering customers who are not part of gold to participate in the margin program, but at higher rates. And in terms of kind of go-forward guidance, what I would just say is that we'll continue to see a meaningful portion of these rates accrued to shareholders, but balanced by our intention to also offer just great value for customers. You bet. Thank you. Yes. I think there's a couple of things that I can say that will be helpful, but we haven't provided guidance on exit run rates. The stock-based comp for the market-based awards that were given pre-IPO to the founders, that is recognized on an accelerated basis. And so, that will decline over time, recognizing more in earlier periods and less in later periods. Also, as we hit those share prices, it will cause an acceleration of the related tranches that are affected by that. So it will be accelerated and also potentially lumpy as we hit those triggers. Really proud of the team, both on OpEx, primarily on OpEx, both for third-party spend in particular, making great progress, a lot of collaboration across the teams. One area to highlight is the focus that our engineering team has had on improving our efficient use of our web hosting. But we've got lots of examples kind of across the company of just driving improvements, all reflected in the pretty favorable incremental guidance that we gave in our release. Yes. We were able to achieve a higher negotiated rate than what we had previously. It is disclosed on our app and website. We took it from kind of low 20s to now, its 35 basis points. Yes. You bet, Will. Thanks, Will. Yeah, I'll go ahead and take it, and then Vlad can jump in. What we're really focused on is improving the user experience. Vlad mentioned a couple of things around the brokerage user experience. We're continuing to add new coins for crypto in a very diligent way and also looking to new products that we roll out fully paid securities lending, which we recently rolled out. We're seeing really nice early traction with $3 billion of equities under management that are already enrolled. The Cash Card is another area. It's a new product and one that we're really excited about improving the user experience. And then, of course, we're going to see some benefit from the rising interest rate. A couple of the rate hikes that happened in Q2 happened late in the quarter, and you'll begin to see that flow through at a higher rate in Q3. So I think we like our focus on user experience and new products and expect that that's going to begin to show through in our financials over time. I'd say that, overall customer acquisition is lower right now in periods of more market enthusiasm. We found that customer acquisition comes a little easier. And right now, it's a little lower. We've pulled back on marketing. We found that chasing growth in this environment doesn't have the same ROI is in periods where you have higher intent customers. So it's \u2013 it continues to be competitive. We continue to work on kind of the inputs of customer experience, and we expect that at some point, hopefully soon, we'll work our way through this cycle. Thank you. It's early. I don't know offhand if we have shared the revenue split, I don't believe so. So I'm not going to lean into that particular aspect of your question. It's early. We've got about $50 billion of equities under management today. $3 billion of that is enrolled. The teams are hard at work at making sure our customers are aware of the program, aware of the way that they can increase their passive income by participating in the program, and we like the growth that we're seeing kind of on a weekly basis and look forward to updating you. But it's early, and we've got a ways to go before it reaches that potential. So sorry, go ahead and repeat that list again for me, Ken. Yes. We have about a 6% attach rate on gold. Cash Card, it's early. We haven't said the number of users at this point. What we're focused on really right now is just improving the user experience. Last week, for example, we've rolled out merchant incentives, which gives customers cash back on spending their card at places like gas stations, pizza parlors and so on, which we think is great for customers. So what we're really focused on is improving user experience, improving the value proposition. And then just getting the word out, finding ways within the app and otherwise, there are questions about marketing earlier to get the word out to customers about the products that we have and the great value proposition that we have for them. Yes. Thanks for your questions, Ken, and thanks to everyone for questions today."

Other potential risk factors that could cause differences are described in our press release issued this afternoon, the related slide presentation on our Investor Relations website, our Form 10-K filed February 24th, 2022, and in our other SEC filings. We remind you that from time-to-time, we intend to use the overview page of our Investor Relations website and our blog, Under the Hood, as means of disclosing material information to the public and investors should routinely monitor those sites, as information posted there, it could be deemed to be material information. All information on the call is as of today April 28, 2022 and vendor take no duty to update it for subsequent events except as required by law. As we discuss our results, all percentage growth comparisons will be to the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise noted. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investors.robinhood.com. And with that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks Irv, and thanks to everyone for joining. So this quarter was the story of two competing forces, our accelerating product development, juxtaposed against a difficult macroeconomic climate. On the last call, I laid out an ambitious roadmap that will expand the ecosystem of financial products Robinhood offers to our customers. We made tremendous progress on at this quarter and we built a strong foundation for our future growth. At the same time, we face a challenging macro environment. One, most of our customers have never experienced in their lifetimes. While we were pleased to see strong net deposits and our lowest level of churn in years, we also saw decreased trading volumes, monthly active users and assets under custody and our financial results reflect this. Our company has been in a period of hyper growth and we hired and scaled to keep pace with the business, but we're at a place where it's important to stay focused on efficiency and optimize our business for the long-term. So I've challenged the team to dig deeper on cost discipline and get us to adjusted EBITDA profitability by the end of the year. We're moving back towards a leaner operating model, starting with the reduction in force that we announced earlier this week, but make no mistake, Robinhood is still playing offense and charging ahead. We are continuing to execute on our 2022 roadmap and we've got several new products in flight that we believe will add value to customers while generating significant revenues. I know there's a lot to unpack here and we'll walk through all of this over the course of the call. So let's start with the product updates. So in short, our product engine is humming and I'm super excited of about that. Just since we last spoke, we introduced the Robinhood Cash Card. We extended our trading hours. We began the rollout of our fully paid securities lending product. We began the rollout of instant debit card funding and withdrawals. We completed the rollout of our crypto wallets. We added four new crypto currencies to our crypto selection, and we entered into an agreement to acquire Ziglu, which will help accelerate our international expansion. There's a lot here for us to be proud of and we're still just getting started. Now, let me get into the details on what we've delivered. Starting with the Robinhood Cash Card, it\u2019s one of the few debit cards to offer rewards similar to what you'd expect from a credit card. We're also giving customers who direct deposit access to their money two days early and we're letting them automatically invest a portion of their paycheck. We view the cash card as a simple way to bring in new customers that are interested in investing, but have less disposable income. And as the product scales, we'll start to see additional revenues from interchange, which we expect to be roughly 130 basis points of transaction volume. We also expect to see more customers direct depositing their paychecks directly into Robinhood and using Robinhood for anything they would use their bank for except with lower fees and a much better user experience. We're still in the early stages here. Rolling out slowly to ensure we understand user behavior and points of friction. We're happy with what we're seeing so far, bright spots around adoption of direct deposit and repeat card usage and we'll expand access to all of our customer by midyear. So with the coming anticipated rate hikes, we will also be bringing back high yield on uninvested brokerage cash for our customers. Stay tuned for more on that. Now let's talk about crypto. As you can tell, we've been making major investments here. We believe that crypto is more than just an asset class by allowing anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection to create and utilize powerful financial tools. The technology behind crypto has the potential to become the operating system that powers the future of financial services. However, crypto is complicated and the fees on other platforms are so high that a lot of the products are mainly serving wealthy early adopters. In the coming months, you'll see more from us on our plans to contribute to this ecosystem. Now, here are few updates on the progress in crypto we've already made. First, we're so excited to have completed the rollout of crypto wallets to all of our customers. The wallet is an important primitive that enables our customers to engage with the broader crypto ecosystem. Just like with crypto trading customers using our wallets can expect low fees and a simple user experience. Second, we recently announced our planned integration with the lightning network, which will power near instantaneous Bitcoin transfers globally with transaction fees of less than a penny, hugely beneficial to our customers. While we don't have specific updates on timing yet we'll share more in the coming months as we build out the integration. Eventually once we\u2019re fully integrated, we expect this technology will accelerate our ability to serve Bitcoin remittances on a global scale at virtually no cost and will be an important component of our international expansion. Third, we added four new coins, Compound, Polygon, Shiba Inu, and Solana. We feel good about the listing framework we're using to evaluate new coins and expect to add more over time. Behind the scenes, we've also been refining our core crypto infrastructure to effortlessly custody and support new coins, tokens, and chains. This is part of a process that began last year and will soon be able to add new coins with relatively minimal effort. Lastly, we recently entered into an agreement to acquire Ziglu for $170 million, primarily in cash. Ziglu is a UK based crypto platform that lets customers transact in 11 different cryptocurrencies, earn yield on Bitcoin and pound Sterling through Ziglu's boost products and move and spend money even abroad without fees. Over the past few months, I've had the pleasure of getting to know Mark and the Ziglu team. They share our love for building great products. They bring years of financial services and crypto expertise, and they have local knowledge. That will be incredibly helpful as we expand our operations in the UK and beyond. They've also demonstrated a real commitment to regular compliance, being one of the first UK companies to obtain a crypto asset registration from the FCA together. We believe we'll be well positioned to move even faster on our international expansion plans once we close, which is expected to be later this year. Last but not least, we've been laser focused on serving our more advanced customers, a large and critical customer segment. These customers while relatively small in number drive a significant portion of our revenue. They love the simplicity of the interface and the ability to trade with no commissions, particularly in options where we also have no contract fees, but they want more the flexibility to dive deeper and get more information through advanced charting and screening tools, as well as improvements to the core trading flows, providing all of this while making the simplicity of the platform continue to stay that way is the type of design challenge that we excel at solving. We've recently introduced two important features for advanced customers, extended trading hours, which we launched earlier this quarter was one of their top requests. And earlier this week, we rolled out fully paid securities lending to a small set of customers. This will give advanced customers a great way to enhance the yield on their portfolios. And we look forward to sharing it more broadly in the next few weeks. There's so much more that we're doing for our advanced customers in the coming months. And we're confident this work will not only benefit all of our customers, but also increase our top line revenue. Now at the top of the call, I mentioned the challenges presented by the macro environment. For most of our history, Robinhood has operated in a period of low interest rates, low inflation and rising markets. Our customers are now experiencing all three of these trends going in the opposite direction, perhaps for the first time in their lives. As a result, some are engaging with us less regularly and reducing their trading activities. We've been watching customer behavior. And let me tell you what we're seeing. So overall, our customers are continuing to engage with us, but the total numbers have come down a bit with MAUs falling to 15.9 million in March. When we look a level deeper, our larger customers are still remaining active. We are seeing more pronounced declines from those that have lower balances. With the uncertainty in the market, our customers became more cautious with their portfolios, trading less frequently and in smaller amounts across all asset classes. Although, crypto activity in particular came down pretty significantly but we've seen some encouraging signs, net deposit levels are continuing to rise and churn has reached its lowest point in years. So how are we responding to the environment we're in? We're going to remain focused on building for the long-term. We're in a great position. We have nearly 23 million customers, a strong team, great technology and strong product momentum. Together with our focus on operational efficiency, the future ahead of us remains bright. And with that, let me turn it over to Jason.\nJason Warnick: Thanks Vlad. Before we get to the numbers, I'd like to talk about how we're thinking about getting back to positive adjusted EBITDA. As you just heard from Vlad, he's challenged us to achieve a positive run rate by year-end. So how do we get there? It's critical that we execute on our 2022 roadmap and be more lean. From where we stand today, we see top line upside from delivering better service to our advanced customers, rolling out fully paid securities lending, generating stronger net interest revenue and monetizing instant withdrawals. We also think over a longer time horizon, there will be even more benefits coming from interchange on the Robinhood cash card investments. We're making in crypto and several other new initiatives that we have in the work. We are also focused on costs. We recently went through a period of get big, fast, as we hired to keep up with the pace of our business. We grew our headcount from about 700 at the end of 2019 to nearly 3,900 in just two years. We needed to grow that fast, but it resulted in inefficiencies in the organization, duplicate roles, and sometimes just more headcount than is needed, particularly as we deliver on optimizing our workflows. So earlier this week, we announced a reduction in force affecting 9% of our team. But as we look at our aggressive product plans for the year we believe we can accomplish our goal with an even leaner team than we were previously planning. So in addition to our reduction in force, we have significantly cut our plans for hiring this year. Last quarter, I guided 2022 operating expenses, excluding share based compensation to grow between 15% and 20%. We now expect these costs to increase between 2% and 5% versus 2021. We're aiming to keep headcount roughly flat versus the end of last year. We're also looking at all of our other costs and believe we have opportunity there as well. We have a lot to reach \u2013 we have a lot to do to reach this goal on profitability, but I've got confidence in the team. Now let's talk about corporate cash specifically how much is needed to run the business and how much is true in excess. We\u2019re currently holding about $6 billion in cash on our balance sheet. During most days, we use only a small fraction of this for working capital. We also hold some liquidity for high stress scenarios, such as last year\u2019s meme stock and Doge rallies, including credit facilities we currently have about $2.5 billion of excess liquidity beyond our stress scenarios. We also have line of sight to free up an additional $1 billion by optimizing the way we move of our money. And why do we have this excess cash? We think it\u2019s prudent to have a strong balance sheet, while we are growing our business. And it also gives us flexibility to grow inorganically when it makes sense to do so. I\u2019d also like to talk about the effects of rate hikes by the Fed. With this first rate change, we captured an annual run rate effect of about $40 million. Looking ahead, we think the incremental effect from each of the next several rate hikes will be in the range of $30 million to $35 million and will be determined by the size of our margin book, the value our banking partners pass to us and how much we pass along to customers. Now let\u2019s move to the numbers for the first quarter of 2022. As a reminder, Q1 is lapping a very strong quarter in the prior year owing to the meme stock rally last year. Cumulative net funded accounts reached 22.8 million up 27% year-over-year. During the quarter, we had 500,000 new accounts, 1,000 resurrections and 500,000 churned accounts. Churn continues to improve and has reached one of the lowest rates we\u2019ve seen in the past several years. We had 15.9 million monthly active users down 10% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. And this market we\u2019re seeing customers with lower balances, engaging less, which is driving the significant majority of our sequential decline in MAUs. Assets under custody were $93.1 billion up 15% year-over-year and net deposits were $5.7 billion in the quarter. Total revenues were $299 million for the quarter down 43% year-over-year and down 18% versus Q4. Revenues came in softer than our expectations. We anticipated some incremental improvement to the trading environment from what we had seen during the first several weeks of the quarter. But trading volumes remain soft across all asset categories. Transaction based revenues were $218 million for the quarter down 48% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. This was driven by declines in the number of customers trading as well as the average notional size of their trades, a pattern that we saw across all asset classes. Equities revenue was $36 million down 73% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. Customers placing trades were down 46% year-over-year, while notional volumes per trader were down 24%. Options revenue was $127 million down 36% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. Customers placing trades were down 44% year-over-year and options contracts for trader were down 33% and crypto revenue was $54 million down 39% year-over-year, but up 13% sequentially. Customers placing trades were down 61% year-over-year and notional volumes per trader decreased by 22%. These declines significantly offset the recent increase in venue rebate rates. Moving to assets under custody. Equities was $68.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Options was $1.1 billion down 45% year-over-year. Crypto increased to $19.7 billion up 70% year-over-year and customer cash increased to $9.2 billion up 21% year-over-year offset by $5.4 billion of receivables from users. And for net interest revenues they were $55 million for the quarter down 11% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, primary components include securities lending and margin interest. Securities lending was $24 million down 31% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, as we saw lower demand for hard to borrow securities. Margin interest was $35 million up 25% year-over-year, but down 10% sequentially. Over the course of the quarter, we saw our margin users actively managing their borrowing. As a result, our margin book declined to $5.3 billion, putting it roughly flat with the prior year. As of March 23, we increased our margin rates to 3% up 50 basis points and we anticipate floating this rate along with fed rate changes moving forward. An offsetting interest revenue was interest expense, which was $6 million. Moving to other revenues. They were $26 million this quarter, a 35% decrease versus the prior year and 26% decline sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by an 87% reduction in our ACATS out fees as we experienced elevated churn last year. Before closing out, I\u2019d like to note that starting this quarter we\u2019ll begin providing monthly metrics for our top KPIs. These disclosures will include information about user growth, engagement and trading, including trading volumes and darts by asset class. We\u2019ll post these metrics to the investor relations website at investors.robinhood.com mid month after the end of each of the first two months of the calendar quarter. The metrics for the last month of each quarter will be shared at earnings. With this change, we will no longer be providing revenue guidance. Given the volatility of our revenue, particularly transaction based revenues from trading activity, we believe providing monthly disclosures of our top KPIs is preferable to forward looking guidance. So far in April, we\u2019re seeing trading volumes in the line with what we were seeing throughout most of Q1. With that Irv, let\u2019s move to Q&A.\nA - Irvin Sha: Thanks, Jason. Leading into this quarter\u2019s Q&A session, we\u2019ll start by answering the top questions from Say ranked by number of votes. We\u2019ll pass over any questions that were already addressed and we\u2019ll group together questions that share a common theme. After that we\u2019ll turn it over to live questions from the analyst community. And with that, our first question is from Andrew K, echoed a couple times by Jazz Vendor B and Abdul Basir M. The question is what are management\u2019s plans to grow and/or regain market cap?\nVlad Tenev: Sure. I\u2019ll field that one. Thank you, Andrew. So first let me say that we all know this is a challenging time in the markets. And our focus during this time is on building a great company for the long-term. You\u2019ve heard us talk about several large areas of investment throughout the beginning of this call. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest in new product areas. Our product momentum and velocity across both our core business and these new developments is going to continue to accelerate. You also heard we\u2019re going to be focused on operational discipline and getting to positive adjusted EBITDA by the end of the year. I think throughout the course of this year, deepening the relationships with our customers, especially the most engaged customers that use Robinhood a lot will lead to greater monetization over time and will allow us to get to positive adjusted EBITDA by the end of the year. But have to completely reiterate that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in new products. And over time, we believe that building a good rate company for the long-term will lead increases in market cap and smoothen out variations in market activity over time.\nIrvin Sha: Thanks, Vlad. The next question comes from Sunny P who asks, when is Hood going to pay a dividend? Jason?\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Sunny. This is Jason. It\u2019s too early for us to be paying out dividends. We think it\u2019s better right now to be investing in the business. We\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity ahead of us as we\u2019ve been talking about today and we think that\u2019s the best use for our capital right now. But appreciate the question.\nIrvin Sha: Great. Next up from Daniel L. What will Robinhood do to combat declining monthly active user?\nVlad Tenev: Sure. I\u2019ll take that one. So we have seen recent declines. But I think it\u2019s important to look at the broader context. Robinhood has grown very quickly over the last few years. For instance, if you look at monthly active users over the past two years, we\u2019ve nearly doubled MAUs from 8.6 million to right around 15.9 million. So looking ahead, we\u2019re going to continue to innovate and roll out new products. And we see our customers engage with us in new ways. A good example is the recently rolled out a Cash Card, which we\u2019re rolling out to our customers. I think it\u2019s a great way to have customers using us for more than just investing direct depositing their paychecks into Robinhood and using us for anything that they would use their local bank for, except with lower cost and a much better customer experience. So as we continue to add these new products, while also adding more products to investing and crypto, we\u2019re confident in our ability to not only retain our existing customers, but significantly grow new ones over time.\nIrvin Sha: Great. Next up from Kevin L. What is the number one focus this year?\nVlad Tenev: Yes, I\u2019ll field that one. The number one focus for us is focusing on our customers, building products that our customers love. And of course, we\u2019ll balance that with focusing on operating lean and making smart decisions with our capital. As we said last quarter, you look to our roadmap and there\u2019s lots of ambitious things that we know customers could benefit from. So there\u2019s more that we have to do for retirement and long-term investing. Securities lending which allows customers to get additional yield on their portfolios, which started rolling out earlier this week and of course, crypto. So what we saw this quarter is demonstrating a lot of momentum and execution, and I think that\u2019s really, really exciting and we\u2019re excited to continue that moving forward.\nIrvin Sha: Okay. Next up, we\u2019ve got a couple questions on retirement accounts from Ryan B and Sarah L. Basically will retirement accounts be available soon?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. So retirement accounts have been a focus for us this year and we\u2019ve been making great progress. I think that when customers see what we have in store, they\u2019ll be really excited. It\u2019ll bring the same design and user experience that customers have come to expect from Robinhood customers, from Robinhood products. And it\u2019ll be a great product, and we\u2019re excited to roll it out later this year.\nIrvin Sha: Excellent. From Abinav S. What are the next top three big changes Robinhood is bringing to customers this year?\nVlad Tenev: Sure. Hey Abinav. So I mentioned \u2013 I\u2019ve mentioned a lot about our product velocity accelerating, and we\u2019ve made lots of improvements to our customer experience and feature set across the board. Three themes to mention one, the active investor experience. We\u2019re really excited to better serve our active investors. The people that are most engaged into our platform. And we\u2019ve seen the experience getting better and better with new products, and also a lot of small improvements to the day to day process of trading and setting up an account on Robinhood. So it\u2019s been a huge area of focus valuable for these customers, but also valuable to the top line of the company. So that\u2019s one. Number two, the Cash Card. We talked a little bit about this are excited to see customers engaging with us in different ways. This is one of the only debit cards on the market that gives customers rewards for spending similar to what they would get from a credit card. And our experience around direct deposits is also incredibly high quality where we not only give customers the ability to get paid two days early, but we also make it easy to invest your paycheck and direct deposit into securities as well as crypto. And then the third area is crypto. No surprise that we\u2019ve been investing a lot here. We\u2019ve increased our selection and we\u2019ve also improved cost for customers as well. And I\u2019ll throw a bonus number four. You\u2019ve heard me talk about retirement. I think that this is a very, very important need for our customers to get help investing for the long-term with the same low cost and user experience customers have grown to love and expect from Robinhood. So we\u2019re very excited to deliver that for our customers and we think you\u2019ll really like it.\nIrvin Sha: Awesome. Thanks, Vlad. I think maybe we have time for just one last question and then we\u2019ll shift to the analyst community. So the last one from Eduardo V is when is Robinhood going global?\nVlad Tenev: Well, we\u2019re excited to have announced the acquisition of Ziglu. We expect to have the acquisition close later this year, and we think it\u2019s a great accelerant we intend to build from that base and roll out an awesome product to our customers in the UK first and then Europe and the rest of the world.\nIrvin Sha: Awesome. Thanks to everyone who posted questions on the Say. And with that, I will ask the operator to open up the line. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nDevin Ryan: Good afternoon Vlad and Jason. How are you?\nVlad Tenev: Hi, Devin. Good to hear from you.\nDevin Ryan: First of all, thanks for the monthly disclosure. I think that\u2019ll be very helpful moving forward. I guess, first question here, you appreciate expectations around getting through breakeven by year end. I think what a lot of folks are trying to kind of figure out here is, you\u2019ve launched a lot of new products and hopefully you see traction around them. But can you help us maybe think about just the revenue contribution from some of the larger initiatives and how you expect those might scale given that they weren\u2019t in the prior quarter\u2019s results. And then the second part of that question is, if you succeed in getting to kind of profitability, how do you expect to manage from there? Should we think about just kind of maintaining around that level, that breakeven? Or should it inflect through and then, to the extent revenues continue to expand, there\u2019s a lot more operating leverage from there?\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Devin. This is Jason. I\u2019ll take it and Vlad can contribute if he has some additional thoughts. The biggest contributors from where we are today and where we need to get by the end of the year to kind of achieve this goal of adjusted EBITDA breakeven, or better. We had ARPU of about $53 for this quarter. We need to get to kind of mid 80s by the end of the year to be able to get to that goal. The biggest contributors heard Vlad talk about the improvements that we\u2019re just making to the platform, primarily listening to some of our more active customers. We think it\u2019s going to serve them incredibly well. It\u2019s going to have a halo effect to all of the customers that we have on the platform. We just started out \u2013 started rolling out fully paid securities lending. We talked a bit last quarter about the revenue opportunity there. It\u2019s about 1 to 2 times what we have for margin securities lending, depending on the attach rate of our customers. The rising interest rates by the fed we\u2019re going to be able to capture meaningful NIM as that continues to progress. And then instant withdrawal is another contributor. All in, we think that we can get there. It\u2019s an aggressive goal. It\u2019s going to take I think a lot of focus on operating costs and we\u2019ve got the commitment of the whole team to get there. In terms of how are we going to manage it going forward? What I\u2019ll tell you is that we\u2019re going to continue to invest aggressively for long term growth. But I think as we continue to rollout products that add monetization to the platform, you\u2019re going to see that the investments that we\u2019re making are relatively less relative to the overall profitability of the company as we gain momentum. But it\u2019s not a one year thing for maintaining operational discipline. We want to be a lean company. We want that to be part of our DNA, and I would expect that to continue beyond this year.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. And I would just add Devin that it\u2019s very much part of Robinhood\u2019s DNA to operate lean and efficient. And over the past year, we\u2019ve made a lot of improvements to our technology and infrastructure. So what we expect is, we want to make sure we demonstrate that the business model works very, very well during slow economic times. And so when volatility does come back to equities markets and to crypto, we should see upside from that. But we also want to make sure that in hard economic times, our business remains resilient and strong. And I think the DNA of efficiency and the fact that we\u2019ve improved our infrastructure tremendously is going to help with that.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, great. I appreciate that. And then I\u2019ll just ask one quick follow-up here. You gave the interest rate sensitivity on, I think a couple hikes here. Are you not providing it kind of in a \u2013 maybe more normalized rate environment because of kind of maybe the earlier comments around reinstating kind of high yield opportunities on cash or how should we continue to roll those types of revenues forward if we normalize to 200 basis points or higher on the short end of the curve?\nJason Warnick: Yes. I appreciate that question. What I\u2019d say there is that there\u2019s some variability in the interest earning accounts that we have. If you look at the margin balances, for example, this quarter came down meaningfully. During the quarter our customers manage their borrowing levels. It also depends on how much we\u2019re able to realize from the banking partners and depending on the balances involved, we\u2019re able to realize more or less. And then to the point that you just raised, we do intend to pass some back to customers as well.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks so much.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Devin.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Your question please.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You have a number of initiatives underway, and I think it would be helpful to get a sense of the opportunity for these future initiatives by seeing how some of your past initiatives have gone. I thought of a couple, maybe there\u2019s some others. But I think you guys had rolled out incoming ACATS. How much engagement are you seeing there? And if you could, where is the money coming from? I think you\u2019ve offered direct deposits for some time. How many clients are sort of utilizing those? I know during the IPO, you guys told us about gold accounts and the number of members there. If you could just update us on how that initiative continues to grow. And I know debit cards are new, but you\u2019ve had a waiting list, I think for some time. How many clients were on that waiting list and how many are using the card in the early days of usage?\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Ken. So just kind of ticking through some of these. So for ACATS, we\u2019ve seen that be one of the channels where customers are inflowing deposits into Robinhood. It\u2019s simply a portion of the channel, I guess, is what I\u2019d say. Last quarter, we had $5.7 billion in net deposits come in a portion of that from ACATS. And we do have thousands of customers using it. I\u2019d tell you that that particular functionality is going to be really helpful as we rollout new account types like retirement in the future as well as for customers that are just joining with us. And the feedback has been good. But we\u2019ve kind of viewed that as just a foundational functionality that we just needed to have on the platform. Direct deposits, while we\u2019ve had the functionality, hasn\u2019t been something that we\u2019ve been really pushing until more recently, we wanted to have a great offering around the Cash Card. So that when customers do direct deposit their paycheck, they\u2019re able to spend as well as invest. It\u2019s really early but the early signal on the Cash Card is that we\u2019re seeing a nice adoption of the direct deposit. In terms of gold. The overall attach rate is about 5.5% that subscription product today largely appeals to more advanced customers. And we have a small team working on the gold subscription product to add value propositions that are going to appeal to a larger swath of our customers. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll update you on later this year. And then debit cards, we\u2019ve just started rolling out the new Robinhood Cash Card. So rolling it out slowly, we had hundreds of thousands on the waitlist of customers. And the prior Cash Card that we had debit card reached about 6 million customers on it. And so we feel really good about the value proposition of this card as we continue to roll it out that it\u2019ll appeal to our customers.\nVlad Tenev: I\u2019ll just throw in there one that you didn\u2019t ask about extended trading hours. So during our rollout, we were seeing some lift in trading behavior versus the control group. But I would say that it\u2019s still pretty early. We have to determine that it\u2019s not just the novelty of the new feature. But we\u2019ve been really pleased with the customer response. As you probably know, it\u2019s been one of the most ask about features for advanced users, and it\u2019s a huge step along the way into our goal of allowing 24/7 trading in equities markets.\nKen Worthington: Awesome. I knew I missed at least something, so thank you for that. And thanks for taking the questions.\nJason Warnick: Thanks for your question, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Good evening, Vlad and Jason.\nVlad Tenev: Hey Rich.\nRich Repetto: How are you doing, Vlad? So I guess my question, you talked a lot about focusing on advanced user and traditionally to look at the e-brokerage industry, from what we understand about it that there was sort of an 80-20 rule where 20% of the accounts generated 80% of the trades and generally the revenue. So I guess my question is how are you defining these users? It may be different by asset class, whether it\u2019s crypto or option, but any sort of feel for how you define it. So we get some sort of feeling of how many advanced users. And does that this 80-20 rule, does it ring home to the way you\u2019re looking at it advance users to your overall customer base.\nJason Warnick: Thanks Rich. It\u2019s Jason, I\u2019ll take this one. So we do have a power law where a smaller portion of the customers do contribute more of the revenue. This is one of the reasons why we\u2019re rolling out new products that we\u2019re excited about, like the Robinhood Cash Card, for example, that is going to help customers, particularly those that don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re able to really set aside extra money to start investing with roundups and the roundup matches that Robinhood provides is giving them an opportunity to contribute. But in terms of like how many, we haven\u2019t said, but it is hundreds of thousands of customers. So it\u2019s a big portion of our customer base.\nRich Repetto: But I guess have you sought to have some internal definition of how \u2013 what are an advanced user is or a cutoff?\nJason Warnick: We do have ways to look at it internally, but it\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve shared outside the company.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. A lot of it is based on engagement with different products. So we have some advanced customers that are trading options. We have ones that are utilizing our competitive margin rates, and we also have customers that love Robinhood for our low crypto fees and our great user experience and are trading crypto quite a bit on our platform. And the way \u2013 the reason we\u2019re saying that we believe improvements to the experience for advanced customers will help everyone is, whenever there\u2019s an issue since these customers are more engaged, they\u2019re more likely to run into them than a typical customer. So by making the experience really, really good for them, as well as adding new features we think the experience for the typical customer will be pristine and more flawless. So we think there\u2019s high leverage here and there\u2019s a lot more to do for our more advanced customers.\nRich Repetto: Okay. And just one quick follow-up, Jason, when you said 2% to 5% on the expense growth now, I believe that\u2019s what you said in the beginning. So the way to build this out would be you use the \u2013 build out the expenses, sort of back out what expenses would be and an EBITDA basis. And then that\u2019s the goal for revenues and all the new products.\nJason Warnick: Yes. The primary thing that you \u2013 the primary thing that you back out on operating expenses would be share based compensation. We have a relatively small restructuring related charge as well on the reduction in force that we just announced. But that\u2019s the right way to think about it about 2% to 5% year-over-year increase in OpEx.\nRich Repetto: Got it. Thanks very much guys. Appreciate it.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Will Nance of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nWill Nance: Hey guys. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I want to say thank you for all the new disclosures, I echo the earlier comments. I think the monthlys will be very helpful going forward and looking forward to following that. I also wanted to ask a question on some of the trends and net cumulative deposits or net new assets. I mean, despite the slowdown in trading activity, the last three months have actually been quite strong in terms of new flows. And it seems like you\u2019re growing the asset base at something like a 15% to 20% annualized clip. So maybe could you talk about strategies in place to continue to deepen the wallet share with customers from just an overall AUM perspective? And then as you think about modernization going forward, be it through increased cash monetization, asset based fees from third-parties or investment advisory relationships. It seems like tying revenue to AUM levels is a solid long-term opportunity for the company. Just how do you kind of size that on the opportunity set?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. We\u2019ve certainly seen the correlation between assets under custody and revenue on the platform. And we think that wallet share and assets under custody are correlated with deepening our relationships with customers and kind of the long-term health of the business. And some of the things that we\u2019re doing there on the new Cash Card side, you\u2019ve heard us talk about direct deposits and getting customers to deposit their paychecks into Robinhood. And we see them depositing those and using our cash card for their day-to-day spending and also using the paycheck auto invest feature to automatically and seamlessly invest a portion of their paychecks directly into stocks and crypto. Retirement accounts, obviously a big one, tax advantaged accounts are really valuable to customers. And we think that that's a great long-term opportunity and also a building block for other passive products down the road. And on the crypto side, we also see a correlation between new asset additions and assets under custody over the long-term. So as we continue to expand our selection there and look out over a longer time horizon, we think that that'll drive assets under custody pretty significantly as well.\nJason Warnick: In terms of \u2013 we\u2019ll monetizing some of these asset gathering activities, obviously there'll be some trading, securities lending should be available interest on uninvested cash. And then over time we can layer on value added services.\nWill Nance: Got it. That's super helpful. I appreciate all the color. And just maybe if I can follow up with one quick technical question on the interest rate modeling, as you're thinking about the margin loan repricing as interest rates rise, could you talk about how much of the margin balances would actually be subject to that interest rate rise? And because I know a decent or some amount of the margin balances are interest-free under the Robinhood Gold Program. So I just wanted to get a sense for how significant that is.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. So the first, if you're a gold member, you get your first $1000 of margin borrowing for free. And so what I would do, Will, is just look at average borrowing per customer, which is disclosed and you can kind of get a pretty good sizing there of how much is interest earning above the $1000.\nWill Nance: Got it. Super helpful. Thanks for taking all my questions.\nVlad Tenev: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nEli Molin: Hi everyone. This is Eli filling in for Craig. I had a question on your digital wallet, so what's the timetable for launching it to the tire client base, not just from the waitlist. And then also, can you help us quantify the magnitude of the impact that you expect the digital wallet to have a wallet share account growth and trading activity? Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: Hi. So yes, we're very excited about the rollout of our wallet. We think that this is an important primitive for customers who are engaging with crypto. We think it's a long-term driver of new customers onto our crypto platform, less so revenue because very few customers actually utilize deposit and withdrawal functionality. They just like to see that it's there especially early adopters because crypto is all about having control of your own assets. And so being a legitimate crypto platform for our customers involves giving customers that can control. And we think that over time, we're going to add more things, more ways for our customers to engage in the broader ecosystem. So wallets enabled that, but at this point on a standalone basis, we actually don't view wallets as a revenue driver.\nJason Warnick: Yes, I would say so, Eli asked about the timetable for full rollout. It is actually fully rolled out, not just the waitlist, but it's now general availability as well. And probably remiss to not to mention that customers get an amazing deal on the coins that we offer. No commission you know absolutely fantastic deal there. And so, having Robinhood offer that kind of pricing to our customers and if they want to be able to come to Robinhood buy and then interact with the broader ecosystem through the wallet functionality we're super happy to provide that.\nEli Molin: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Anagnostakis: Hey, good afternoon. This is Michael Anagnostakis on for Steven. My question is one of your largest competitors announced rather substantial hiring efforts and other public peers are continuing to invest in talent at a rapid pace to support growth. How confident are you in your ability to win market share over the long-term after rationalizing your headcount, particularly given the war for talent in the industry and your orientation of growing the business over the long-term.\nVlad Tenev: Yes, I can feel that one. So it's no surprise. We grew very fast in terms of headcount. So we were 700 full-time employees at the end of 2019, grew to 3,900 at the end of Q1. And at the time we thought that this was right to keep up with the pace of the business, but it also led to some inefficiency, some redundant roles. And we've shown that we've been able to execute rather quickly on the product roadmap in the past couple of quarters. And we actually think that despite right-sizing our headcount and reducing kind of the planned hiring progression, we're still going to hire in key roles and we're still going to accelerate our pace of innovation and achieve our goals. So I think that while it was hard, this was a necessary step for the long-term health of the business.\nJason Warnick: I'd also just add in that, Robinhood at its core as a tech company. And so over time I would expect revenue per employee to be an advantage for this company. So we're going to seek to be nimble, lean and just drive for innovation.\nMichael Anagnostakis: Great. And as my follow up, could you provide some detail around the drivers of the sequential movement and the crypto rebate given that renegotiation you disclosed and some of the mixed dynamics and could you give some color as well around the go-forward impact you're expecting with the new coins. Secondly with the rollout of those coins, are you seeing any early indications that these launches are driving increased interests in your platform from those \u2013 from prospective customers. Understandings, it's only been a few weeks. Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Yes, you bet. So Michael last quarter, we talked a little bit about slightly more than doubling the rebate rate that we were getting from our venues. In that context, we had added an additional venue so more competition, which we think is great for customers. We also just rationalized our share of the profitability between ourselves and the venues, and felt really good about the increase that we got there. In terms of new coins our customers are thrilled that we added more coins response has been good. I'm not going to share specifically how that's doing. We will provide our monthly metrics about mid-month next week. So just \u2013 or next month so just a couple weeks away, and we'll be able to see kind of the progress that we're doing there, but the overall sentiment has been very, very strong and customers are happy that we've added more selection there.\nMichael Anagnostakis: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Trevor Young, Barclays. Your line is open.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thanks. Vlad, just about tailing on that last question, could you talk a little bit about the listing framework that you alluded to in selecting the four new coins that were recently added. And now that this framework is in place, should we expect the cadence of new coins to kind of accelerate from here? And then lastly, on this point, should the eight or nine coins that have real-time data, but aren't tradable yet on the platform be viewed as the roadmap for new coins going forward. Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Sure. Yes, so we do have a comprehensive evaluation framework for new coins and we're comfortable with our listing protocol. So the framework looks at things like the technology behind the coin. The security of the protocol, obviously legal considerations around the coin and liquidity making sure that customers can get into and out of positions flexibly. And of course, customer demand based both on kind of our internal research and external. We do expect that we'll be continuing to add more coins over time. I think you heard us say that we've also been Under the Hood improving our infrastructure to make it easier to safely add new coins in terms of the timelines and how many \u2013 I won't be able to share that with you guys at this time. But I will say that to your question on, should we expect coins that we have market data to be listed by the platform. I think we've said that there's no connection, so it's certainly \u2013 you shouldn't expect that a coin listed for just market data and price tracking will have any likely \u2013 any higher likelihood of eventually being listed on the platform relative to an arbitrary coin.\nTrevor Young: That's really helpful. Thanks. And just a quick follow up for Jason, just any color on marketing spend and strategy in this current environment to either attract new users or to reengage dormant users and relatedly any details on how you're thinking about CAC in light of the higher ARPU goal later in the year?\nJason Warnick: Yes. So thanks for the question on that. Pretty lean on marketing this past quarter I'd expect some increase to marketing throughout the end of the year to support awareness of our new products, general brand awareness. So we'll increase our spending a bit there on marketing and think that's the right thing to do. We are very mindful of our CAC and I've done a lot of experiments over the past to understand diminishing return by channel and the quality of customers that we get. And so we've taken that learning and we've been mindful of that in this particular market environment where interest in investing has generally cooled off from prior periods.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. And I'd also just add that. One of the things we're proud of is despite our low marketing spend this past quarter, Robinhood still remained number one for self-directed brokerages, when you look at weekly downloads. So that's something that makes us feel, feel very confident. We like our position, we love the product roadmap and we look forward to creating more ways for our customers to engage with us and get more value from the offering.\nJason Warnick: Probably just to add too that. Most of our customers come to us either organically or through referrals from their friends and the more that we improve the platform and add more products that our customers love. I think the more that'll spin that flywheel of referrals.\nTrevor Young: Great. Thanks you to both of you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Beck of KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJosh Beck: Thank you team for taking the question. I wanted to go back to, I believe it was Jason's comment about ARPU and kind of the waterfall between say the low 50s in the mid-80s. Certainly it sounds like what's happening with sec lending. What's happening with rates are big contributors of that gap. I'm just curious if there's other components whether it's perhaps the cash card or activity or if there's other factors there that we should be thinking about just in terms of bridging that gap?\nJason Warnick: Yes. So improvements that we've been talking about for advanced traders that will give halo effect to just the user experience on the platform. That's a big piece of it fully paid securities lending in increases in NIM as the Fed increases their rates into instant withdrawals. Those are the big ones, the interchange revenue that we get on the cash card. I think that's more of a longer term opportunity for us. So the other areas are the bigger ones bridging where we are today to where we need to get to.\nJosh Beck: Okay. Very helpful. And then one of the other comments that I picked up on was certainly trying to garner more direct deposits within the cash card, obviously winning those inflows or I think really important to having that holistic financial relationship. So just curious, tactically what you're thinking about in terms of being able to gain some of those direct deposit flows?\nJason Warnick: Yes. Well, I tell you, we've had some experience with this because even prior to the cash card, we had cash management, which we rolled out as an added feature to the investment account. And when we talked to customers we heard a couple of things. One was that they really like their spending and investing to be sort of in their own lane. So separating out into a different balance was something that was very important as we rolled out the cash card. The other thing is just they need to have a reason to direct deposit into Robinhood. And I think having no fees with the cash card and having just a great customer experience is table stakes. We wanted to go beyond that and add really compelling debit card rewards as well as two-day early pay for the paycheck and the ability to seamlessly invest the paycheck into not just stocks, but also crypto. So I think as the equities and crypto offerings continue to mature and progress over time, and as we continue to add new products, this should spin the direct deposit flywheel as well. And there'll be more compelling reasons for customers to deposit their paychecks onto the platform.\nJosh Beck: Very helpful. Thanks Vlad. Thanks, Jason.\nJason Warnick: Thanks Josh.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you everyone.\nJason Warnick: Thank you.",

            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thanks Irv, and thanks to everyone for joining. So this quarter was the story of two competing forces, our accelerating product development, juxtaposed against a difficult macroeconomic climate. On the last call, I laid out an ambitious roadmap that will expand the ecosystem of financial products Robinhood offers to our customers. We made tremendous progress on at this quarter and we built a strong foundation for our future growth. At the same time, we face a challenging macro environment. One, most of our customers have never experienced in their lifetimes. While we were pleased to see strong net deposits and our lowest level of churn in years, we also saw decreased trading volumes, monthly active users and assets under custody and our financial results reflect this. Our company has been in a period of hyper growth and we hired and scaled to keep pace with the business, but we're at a place where it's important to stay focused on efficiency and optimize our business for the long-term. So I've challenged the team to dig deeper on cost discipline and get us to adjusted EBITDA profitability by the end of the year. We're moving back towards a leaner operating model, starting with the reduction in force that we announced earlier this week, but make no mistake, Robinhood is still playing offense and charging ahead. We are continuing to execute on our 2022 roadmap and we've got several new products in flight that we believe will add value to customers while generating significant revenues. I know there's a lot to unpack here and we'll walk through all of this over the course of the call. So let's start with the product updates. So in short, our product engine is humming and I'm super excited of about that. Just since we last spoke, we introduced the Robinhood Cash Card. We extended our trading hours. We began the rollout of our fully paid securities lending product. We began the rollout of instant debit card funding and withdrawals. We completed the rollout of our crypto wallets. We added four new crypto currencies to our crypto selection, and we entered into an agreement to acquire Ziglu, which will help accelerate our international expansion. There's a lot here for us to be proud of and we're still just getting started. Now, let me get into the details on what we've delivered. Starting with the Robinhood Cash Card, it's one of the few debit cards to offer rewards similar to what you'd expect from a credit card. We're also giving customers who direct deposit access to their money two days early and we're letting them automatically invest a portion of their paycheck. We view the cash card as a simple way to bring in new customers that are interested in investing, but have less disposable income. And as the product scales, we'll start to see additional revenues from interchange, which we expect to be roughly 130 basis points of transaction volume. We also expect to see more customers direct depositing their paychecks directly into Robinhood and using Robinhood for anything they would use their bank for except with lower fees and a much better user experience. We're still in the early stages here. Rolling out slowly to ensure we understand user behavior and points of friction. We're happy with what we're seeing so far, bright spots around adoption of direct deposit and repeat card usage and we'll expand access to all of our customer by midyear. So with the coming anticipated rate hikes, we will also be bringing back high yield on uninvested brokerage cash for our customers. Stay tuned for more on that. Now let's talk about crypto. As you can tell, we've been making major investments here. We believe that crypto is more than just an asset class by allowing anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection to create and utilize powerful financial tools. The technology behind crypto has the potential to become the operating system that powers the future of financial services. However, crypto is complicated and the fees on other platforms are so high that a lot of the products are mainly serving wealthy early adopters. In the coming months, you'll see more from us on our plans to contribute to this ecosystem. Now, here are few updates on the progress in crypto we've already made. First, we're so excited to have completed the rollout of crypto wallets to all of our customers. The wallet is an important primitive that enables our customers to engage with the broader crypto ecosystem. Just like with crypto trading customers using our wallets can expect low fees and a simple user experience. Second, we recently announced our planned integration with the lightning network, which will power near instantaneous Bitcoin transfers globally with transaction fees of less than a penny, hugely beneficial to our customers. While we don't have specific updates on timing yet we'll share more in the coming months as we build out the integration. Eventually once we're fully integrated, we expect this technology will accelerate our ability to serve Bitcoin remittances on a global scale at virtually no cost and will be an important component of our international expansion. Third, we added four new coins, Compound, Polygon, Shiba Inu, and Solana. We feel good about the listing framework we're using to evaluate new coins and expect to add more over time. Behind the scenes, we've also been refining our core crypto infrastructure to effortlessly custody and support new coins, tokens, and chains. This is part of a process that began last year and will soon be able to add new coins with relatively minimal effort. Lastly, we recently entered into an agreement to acquire Ziglu for $170 million, primarily in cash. Ziglu is a UK based crypto platform that lets customers transact in 11 different cryptocurrencies, earn yield on Bitcoin and pound Sterling through Ziglu's boost products and move and spend money even abroad without fees. Over the past few months, I've had the pleasure of getting to know Mark and the Ziglu team. They share our love for building great products. They bring years of financial services and crypto expertise, and they have local knowledge. That will be incredibly helpful as we expand our operations in the UK and beyond. They've also demonstrated a real commitment to regular compliance, being one of the first UK companies to obtain a crypto asset registration from the FCA together. We believe we'll be well positioned to move even faster on our international expansion plans once we close, which is expected to be later this year. Last but not least, we've been laser focused on serving our more advanced customers, a large and critical customer segment. These customers while relatively small in number drive a significant portion of our revenue. They love the simplicity of the interface and the ability to trade with no commissions, particularly in options where we also have no contract fees, but they want more the flexibility to dive deeper and get more information through advanced charting and screening tools, as well as improvements to the core trading flows, providing all of this while making the simplicity of the platform continue to stay that way is the type of design challenge that we excel at solving. We've recently introduced two important features for advanced customers, extended trading hours, which we launched earlier this quarter was one of their top requests. And earlier this week, we rolled out fully paid securities lending to a small set of customers. This will give advanced customers a great way to enhance the yield on their portfolios. And we look forward to sharing it more broadly in the next few weeks. There's so much more that we're doing for our advanced customers in the coming months. And we're confident this work will not only benefit all of our customers, but also increase our top line revenue. Now at the top of the call, I mentioned the challenges presented by the macro environment. For most of our history, Robinhood has operated in a period of low interest rates, low inflation and rising markets. Our customers are now experiencing all three of these trends going in the opposite direction, perhaps for the first time in their lives. As a result, some are engaging with us less regularly and reducing their trading activities. We've been watching customer behavior. And let me tell you what we're seeing. So overall, our customers are continuing to engage with us, but the total numbers have come down a bit with MAUs falling to 15.9 million in March. When we look a level deeper, our larger customers are still remaining active. We are seeing more pronounced declines from those that have lower balances. With the uncertainty in the market, our customers became more cautious with their portfolios, trading less frequently and in smaller amounts across all asset classes. Although, crypto activity in particular came down pretty significantly but we've seen some encouraging signs, net deposit levels are continuing to rise and churn has reached its lowest point in years. So how are we responding to the environment we're in? We're going to remain focused on building for the long-term. We're in a great position. We have nearly 23 million customers, a strong team, great technology and strong product momentum. Together with our focus on operational efficiency, the future ahead of us remains bright. And with that, let me turn it over to Jason. Sure. I'll field that one. Thank you, Andrew. So first let me say that we all know this is a challenging time in the markets. And our focus during this time is on building a great company for the long-term. You've heard us talk about several large areas of investment throughout the beginning of this call. And we're going to continue to invest in new product areas. Our product momentum and velocity across both our core business and these new developments is going to continue to accelerate. You also heard we're going to be focused on operational discipline and getting to positive adjusted EBITDA by the end of the year. I think throughout the course of this year, deepening the relationships with our customers, especially the most engaged customers that use Robinhood a lot will lead to greater monetization over time and will allow us to get to positive adjusted EBITDA by the end of the year. But have to completely reiterate that we're going to continue to invest in new products. And over time, we believe that building a good rate company for the long-term will lead increases in market cap and smoothen out variations in market activity over time. Sure. I'll take that one. So we have seen recent declines. But I think it's important to look at the broader context. Robinhood has grown very quickly over the last few years. For instance, if you look at monthly active users over the past two years, we've nearly doubled MAUs from 8.6 million to right around 15.9 million. So looking ahead, we're going to continue to innovate and roll out new products. And we see our customers engage with us in new ways. A good example is the recently rolled out a Cash Card, which we're rolling out to our customers. I think it's a great way to have customers using us for more than just investing direct depositing their paychecks into Robinhood and using us for anything that they would use their local bank for, except with lower cost and a much better customer experience. So as we continue to add these new products, while also adding more products to investing and crypto, we're confident in our ability to not only retain our existing customers, but significantly grow new ones over time. Yes, I'll field that one. The number one focus for us is focusing on our customers, building products that our customers love. And of course, we'll balance that with focusing on operating lean and making smart decisions with our capital. As we said last quarter, you look to our roadmap and there's lots of ambitious things that we know customers could benefit from. So there's more that we have to do for retirement and long-term investing. Securities lending which allows customers to get additional yield on their portfolios, which started rolling out earlier this week and of course, crypto. So what we saw this quarter is demonstrating a lot of momentum and execution, and I think that's really, really exciting and we're excited to continue that moving forward. Yes. So retirement accounts have been a focus for us this year and we've been making great progress. I think that when customers see what we have in store, they'll be really excited. It'll bring the same design and user experience that customers have come to expect from Robinhood customers, from Robinhood products. And it'll be a great product, and we're excited to roll it out later this year. Sure. Hey Abinav. So I mentioned \u2013 I've mentioned a lot about our product velocity accelerating, and we've made lots of improvements to our customer experience and feature set across the board. Three themes to mention one, the active investor experience. We're really excited to better serve our active investors. The people that are most engaged into our platform. And we've seen the experience getting better and better with new products, and also a lot of small improvements to the day to day process of trading and setting up an account on Robinhood. So it's been a huge area of focus valuable for these customers, but also valuable to the top line of the company. So that's one. Number two, the Cash Card. We talked a little bit about this are excited to see customers engaging with us in different ways. This is one of the only debit cards on the market that gives customers rewards for spending similar to what they would get from a credit card. And our experience around direct deposits is also incredibly high quality where we not only give customers the ability to get paid two days early, but we also make it easy to invest your paycheck and direct deposit into securities as well as crypto. And then the third area is crypto. No surprise that we've been investing a lot here. We've increased our selection and we've also improved cost for customers as well. And I'll throw a bonus number four. You've heard me talk about retirement. I think that this is a very, very important need for our customers to get help investing for the long-term with the same low cost and user experience customers have grown to love and expect from Robinhood. So we're very excited to deliver that for our customers and we think you'll really like it. Well, we're excited to have announced the acquisition of Ziglu. We expect to have the acquisition close later this year, and we think it's a great accelerant we intend to build from that base and roll out an awesome product to our customers in the UK first and then Europe and the rest of the world. Hi, Devin. Good to hear from you. Yes. And I would just add Devin that it's very much part of Robinhood's DNA to operate lean and efficient. And over the past year, we've made a lot of improvements to our technology and infrastructure. So what we expect is, we want to make sure we demonstrate that the business model works very, very well during slow economic times. And so when volatility does come back to equities markets and to crypto, we should see upside from that. But we also want to make sure that in hard economic times, our business remains resilient and strong. And I think the DNA of efficiency and the fact that we've improved our infrastructure tremendously is going to help with that. Thank you. I'll just throw in there one that you didn't ask about extended trading hours. So during our rollout, we were seeing some lift in trading behavior versus the control group. But I would say that it's still pretty early. We have to determine that it's not just the novelty of the new feature. But we've been really pleased with the customer response. As you probably know, it's been one of the most ask about features for advanced users, and it's a huge step along the way into our goal of allowing 24/7 trading in equities markets. Hey Rich. Yes. A lot of it is based on engagement with different products. So we have some advanced customers that are trading options. We have ones that are utilizing our competitive margin rates, and we also have customers that love Robinhood for our low crypto fees and our great user experience and are trading crypto quite a bit on our platform. And the way \u2013 the reason we're saying that we believe improvements to the experience for advanced customers will help everyone is, whenever there's an issue since these customers are more engaged, they're more likely to run into them than a typical customer. So by making the experience really, really good for them, as well as adding new features we think the experience for the typical customer will be pristine and more flawless. So we think there's high leverage here and there's a lot more to do for our more advanced customers. Thank you. Yes. We've certainly seen the correlation between assets under custody and revenue on the platform. And we think that wallet share and assets under custody are correlated with deepening our relationships with customers and kind of the long-term health of the business. And some of the things that we're doing there on the new Cash Card side, you've heard us talk about direct deposits and getting customers to deposit their paychecks into Robinhood. And we see them depositing those and using our cash card for their day-to-day spending and also using the paycheck auto invest feature to automatically and seamlessly invest a portion of their paychecks directly into stocks and crypto. Retirement accounts, obviously a big one, tax advantaged accounts are really valuable to customers. And we think that that's a great long-term opportunity and also a building block for other passive products down the road. And on the crypto side, we also see a correlation between new asset additions and assets under custody over the long-term. So as we continue to expand our selection there and look out over a longer time horizon, we think that that'll drive assets under custody pretty significantly as well. Yes. So the first, if you're a gold member, you get your first $1000 of margin borrowing for free. And so what I would do, Will, is just look at average borrowing per customer, which is disclosed and you can kind of get a pretty good sizing there of how much is interest earning above the $1000. Yes. Hi. So yes, we're very excited about the rollout of our wallet. We think that this is an important primitive for customers who are engaging with crypto. We think it's a long-term driver of new customers onto our crypto platform, less so revenue because very few customers actually utilize deposit and withdrawal functionality. They just like to see that it's there especially early adopters because crypto is all about having control of your own assets. And so being a legitimate crypto platform for our customers involves giving customers that can control. And we think that over time, we're going to add more things, more ways for our customers to engage in the broader ecosystem. So wallets enabled that, but at this point on a standalone basis, we actually don't view wallets as a revenue driver. Yes, I can feel that one. So it's no surprise. We grew very fast in terms of headcount. So we were 700 full-time employees at the end of 2019, grew to 3,900 at the end of Q1. And at the time we thought that this was right to keep up with the pace of the business, but it also led to some inefficiency, some redundant roles. And we've shown that we've been able to execute rather quickly on the product roadmap in the past couple of quarters. And we actually think that despite right-sizing our headcount and reducing kind of the planned hiring progression, we're still going to hire in key roles and we're still going to accelerate our pace of innovation and achieve our goals. So I think that while it was hard, this was a necessary step for the long-term health of the business. Sure. Yes, so we do have a comprehensive evaluation framework for new coins and we're comfortable with our listing protocol. So the framework looks at things like the technology behind the coin. The security of the protocol, obviously legal considerations around the coin and liquidity making sure that customers can get into and out of positions flexibly. And of course, customer demand based both on kind of our internal research and external. We do expect that we'll be continuing to add more coins over time. I think you heard us say that we've also been Under the Hood improving our infrastructure to make it easier to safely add new coins in terms of the timelines and how many \u2013 I won't be able to share that with you guys at this time. But I will say that to your question on, should we expect coins that we have market data to be listed by the platform. I think we've said that there's no connection, so it's certainly \u2013 you shouldn't expect that a coin listed for just market data and price tracking will have any likely \u2013 any higher likelihood of eventually being listed on the platform relative to an arbitrary coin. Yes. And I'd also just add that. One of the things we're proud of is despite our low marketing spend this past quarter, Robinhood still remained number one for self-directed brokerages, when you look at weekly downloads. So that's something that makes us feel, feel very confident. We like our position, we love the product roadmap and we look forward to creating more ways for our customers to engage with us and get more value from the offering. Thank you everyone."

            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks Vlad. Before we get to the numbers, I'd like to talk about how we're thinking about getting back to positive adjusted EBITDA. As you just heard from Vlad, he's challenged us to achieve a positive run rate by year-end. So how do we get there? It's critical that we execute on our 2022 roadmap and be more lean. From where we stand today, we see top line upside from delivering better service to our advanced customers, rolling out fully paid securities lending, generating stronger net interest revenue and monetizing instant withdrawals. We also think over a longer time horizon, there will be even more benefits coming from interchange on the Robinhood cash card investments. We're making in crypto and several other new initiatives that we have in the work. We are also focused on costs. We recently went through a period of get big, fast, as we hired to keep up with the pace of our business. We grew our headcount from about 700 at the end of 2019 to nearly 3,900 in just two years. We needed to grow that fast, but it resulted in inefficiencies in the organization, duplicate roles, and sometimes just more headcount than is needed, particularly as we deliver on optimizing our workflows. So earlier this week, we announced a reduction in force affecting 9% of our team. But as we look at our aggressive product plans for the year we believe we can accomplish our goal with an even leaner team than we were previously planning. So in addition to our reduction in force, we have significantly cut our plans for hiring this year. Last quarter, I guided 2022 operating expenses, excluding share based compensation to grow between 15% and 20%. We now expect these costs to increase between 2% and 5% versus 2021. We're aiming to keep headcount roughly flat versus the end of last year. We're also looking at all of our other costs and believe we have opportunity there as well. We have a lot to reach \u2013 we have a lot to do to reach this goal on profitability, but I've got confidence in the team. Now let's talk about corporate cash specifically how much is needed to run the business and how much is true in excess. We're currently holding about $6 billion in cash on our balance sheet. During most days, we use only a small fraction of this for working capital. We also hold some liquidity for high stress scenarios, such as last year's meme stock and Doge rallies, including credit facilities we currently have about $2.5 billion of excess liquidity beyond our stress scenarios. We also have line of sight to free up an additional $1 billion by optimizing the way we move of our money. And why do we have this excess cash? We think it's prudent to have a strong balance sheet, while we are growing our business. And it also gives us flexibility to grow inorganically when it makes sense to do so. I'd also like to talk about the effects of rate hikes by the Fed. With this first rate change, we captured an annual run rate effect of about $40 million. Looking ahead, we think the incremental effect from each of the next several rate hikes will be in the range of $30 million to $35 million and will be determined by the size of our margin book, the value our banking partners pass to us and how much we pass along to customers. Now let's move to the numbers for the first quarter of 2022. As a reminder, Q1 is lapping a very strong quarter in the prior year owing to the meme stock rally last year. Cumulative net funded accounts reached 22.8 million up 27% year-over-year. During the quarter, we had 500,000 new accounts, 1,000 resurrections and 500,000 churned accounts. Churn continues to improve and has reached one of the lowest rates we've seen in the past several years. We had 15.9 million monthly active users down 10% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. And this market we're seeing customers with lower balances, engaging less, which is driving the significant majority of our sequential decline in MAUs. Assets under custody were $93.1 billion up 15% year-over-year and net deposits were $5.7 billion in the quarter. Total revenues were $299 million for the quarter down 43% year-over-year and down 18% versus Q4. Revenues came in softer than our expectations. We anticipated some incremental improvement to the trading environment from what we had seen during the first several weeks of the quarter. But trading volumes remain soft across all asset categories. Transaction based revenues were $218 million for the quarter down 48% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. This was driven by declines in the number of customers trading as well as the average notional size of their trades, a pattern that we saw across all asset classes. Equities revenue was $36 million down 73% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. Customers placing trades were down 46% year-over-year, while notional volumes per trader were down 24%. Options revenue was $127 million down 36% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. Customers placing trades were down 44% year-over-year and options contracts for trader were down 33% and crypto revenue was $54 million down 39% year-over-year, but up 13% sequentially. Customers placing trades were down 61% year-over-year and notional volumes per trader decreased by 22%. These declines significantly offset the recent increase in venue rebate rates. Moving to assets under custody. Equities was $68.5 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Options was $1.1 billion down 45% year-over-year. Crypto increased to $19.7 billion up 70% year-over-year and customer cash increased to $9.2 billion up 21% year-over-year offset by $5.4 billion of receivables from users. And for net interest revenues they were $55 million for the quarter down 11% year-over-year and 13% sequentially, primary components include securities lending and margin interest. Securities lending was $24 million down 31% year-over-year and 17% sequentially, as we saw lower demand for hard to borrow securities. Margin interest was $35 million up 25% year-over-year, but down 10% sequentially. Over the course of the quarter, we saw our margin users actively managing their borrowing. As a result, our margin book declined to $5.3 billion, putting it roughly flat with the prior year. As of March 23, we increased our margin rates to 3% up 50 basis points and we anticipate floating this rate along with fed rate changes moving forward. An offsetting interest revenue was interest expense, which was $6 million. Moving to other revenues. They were $26 million this quarter, a 35% decrease versus the prior year and 26% decline sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by an 87% reduction in our ACATS out fees as we experienced elevated churn last year. Before closing out, I'd like to note that starting this quarter we'll begin providing monthly metrics for our top KPIs. These disclosures will include information about user growth, engagement and trading, including trading volumes and darts by asset class. We'll post these metrics to the investor relations website at investors.robinhood.com mid month after the end of each of the first two months of the calendar quarter. The metrics for the last month of each quarter will be shared at earnings. With this change, we will no longer be providing revenue guidance. Given the volatility of our revenue, particularly transaction based revenues from trading activity, we believe providing monthly disclosures of our top KPIs is preferable to forward looking guidance. So far in April, we're seeing trading volumes in the line with what we were seeing throughout most of Q1. With that Irv, let's move to Q&A. Thanks, Sunny. This is Jason. It's too early for us to be paying out dividends. We think it's better right now to be investing in the business. We've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us as we've been talking about today and we think that's the best use for our capital right now. But appreciate the question. Thanks, Devin. This is Jason. I'll take it and Vlad can contribute if he has some additional thoughts. The biggest contributors from where we are today and where we need to get by the end of the year to kind of achieve this goal of adjusted EBITDA breakeven, or better. We had ARPU of about $53 for this quarter. We need to get to kind of mid 80s by the end of the year to be able to get to that goal. The biggest contributors heard Vlad talk about the improvements that we're just making to the platform, primarily listening to some of our more active customers. We think it's going to serve them incredibly well. It's going to have a halo effect to all of the customers that we have on the platform. We just started out \u2013 started rolling out fully paid securities lending. We talked a bit last quarter about the revenue opportunity there. It's about 1 to 2 times what we have for margin securities lending, depending on the attach rate of our customers. The rising interest rates by the fed we're going to be able to capture meaningful NIM as that continues to progress. And then instant withdrawal is another contributor. All in, we think that we can get there. It's an aggressive goal. It's going to take I think a lot of focus on operating costs and we've got the commitment of the whole team to get there. In terms of how are we going to manage it going forward? What I'll tell you is that we're going to continue to invest aggressively for long term growth. But I think as we continue to rollout products that add monetization to the platform, you're going to see that the investments that we're making are relatively less relative to the overall profitability of the company as we gain momentum. But it's not a one year thing for maintaining operational discipline. We want to be a lean company. We want that to be part of our DNA, and I would expect that to continue beyond this year. Yes. I appreciate that question. What I'd say there is that there's some variability in the interest earning accounts that we have. If you look at the margin balances, for example, this quarter came down meaningfully. During the quarter our customers manage their borrowing levels. It also depends on how much we're able to realize from the banking partners and depending on the balances involved, we're able to realize more or less. And then to the point that you just raised, we do intend to pass some back to customers as well. Thanks, Devin. Thanks, Ken. So just kind of ticking through some of these. So for ACATS, we've seen that be one of the channels where customers are inflowing deposits into Robinhood. It's simply a portion of the channel, I guess, is what I'd say. Last quarter, we had $5.7 billion in net deposits come in a portion of that from ACATS. And we do have thousands of customers using it. I'd tell you that that particular functionality is going to be really helpful as we rollout new account types like retirement in the future as well as for customers that are just joining with us. And the feedback has been good. But we've kind of viewed that as just a foundational functionality that we just needed to have on the platform. Direct deposits, while we've had the functionality, hasn't been something that we've been really pushing until more recently, we wanted to have a great offering around the Cash Card. So that when customers do direct deposit their paycheck, they're able to spend as well as invest. It's really early but the early signal on the Cash Card is that we're seeing a nice adoption of the direct deposit. In terms of gold. The overall attach rate is about 5.5% that subscription product today largely appeals to more advanced customers. And we have a small team working on the gold subscription product to add value propositions that are going to appeal to a larger swath of our customers. And that's something that we'll update you on later this year. And then debit cards, we've just started rolling out the new Robinhood Cash Card. So rolling it out slowly, we had hundreds of thousands on the waitlist of customers. And the prior Cash Card that we had debit card reached about 6 million customers on it. And so we feel really good about the value proposition of this card as we continue to roll it out that it'll appeal to our customers. Thanks for your question, Ken. Thanks Rich. It's Jason, I'll take this one. So we do have a power law where a smaller portion of the customers do contribute more of the revenue. This is one of the reasons why we're rolling out new products that we're excited about, like the Robinhood Cash Card, for example, that is going to help customers, particularly those that don't feel like they're able to really set aside extra money to start investing with roundups and the roundup matches that Robinhood provides is giving them an opportunity to contribute. But in terms of like how many, we haven't said, but it is hundreds of thousands of customers. So it's a big portion of our customer base. We do have ways to look at it internally, but it's not something that we've shared outside the company. Yes. The primary thing that you \u2013 the primary thing that you back out on operating expenses would be share based compensation. We have a relatively small restructuring related charge as well on the reduction in force that we just announced. But that's the right way to think about it about 2% to 5% year-over-year increase in OpEx. In terms of \u2013 we'll monetizing some of these asset gathering activities, obviously there'll be some trading, securities lending should be available interest on uninvested cash. And then over time we can layer on value added services. Yes, I would say so, Eli asked about the timetable for full rollout. It is actually fully rolled out, not just the waitlist, but it's now general availability as well. And probably remiss to not to mention that customers get an amazing deal on the coins that we offer. No commission you know absolutely fantastic deal there. And so, having Robinhood offer that kind of pricing to our customers and if they want to be able to come to Robinhood buy and then interact with the broader ecosystem through the wallet functionality we're super happy to provide that. I'd also just add in that, Robinhood at its core as a tech company. And so over time I would expect revenue per employee to be an advantage for this company. So we're going to seek to be nimble, lean and just drive for innovation. Yes, you bet. So Michael last quarter, we talked a little bit about slightly more than doubling the rebate rate that we were getting from our venues. In that context, we had added an additional venue so more competition, which we think is great for customers. We also just rationalized our share of the profitability between ourselves and the venues, and felt really good about the increase that we got there. In terms of new coins our customers are thrilled that we added more coins response has been good. I'm not going to share specifically how that's doing. We will provide our monthly metrics about mid-month next week. So just \u2013 or next month so just a couple weeks away, and we'll be able to see kind of the progress that we're doing there, but the overall sentiment has been very, very strong and customers are happy that we've added more selection there. Yes. So thanks for the question on that. Pretty lean on marketing this past quarter I'd expect some increase to marketing throughout the end of the year to support awareness of our new products, general brand awareness. So we'll increase our spending a bit there on marketing and think that's the right thing to do. We are very mindful of our CAC and I've done a lot of experiments over the past to understand diminishing return by channel and the quality of customers that we get. And so we've taken that learning and we've been mindful of that in this particular market environment where interest in investing has generally cooled off from prior periods. Probably just to add too that. Most of our customers come to us either organically or through referrals from their friends and the more that we improve the platform and add more products that our customers love. I think the more that'll spin that flywheel of referrals. Yes. So improvements that we've been talking about for advanced traders that will give halo effect to just the user experience on the platform. That's a big piece of it fully paid securities lending in increases in NIM as the Fed increases their rates into instant withdrawals. Those are the big ones, the interchange revenue that we get on the cash card. I think that's more of a longer term opportunity for us. So the other areas are the bigger ones bridging where we are today to where we need to get to. Yes. Well, I tell you, we've had some experience with this because even prior to the cash card, we had cash management, which we rolled out as an added feature to the investment account. And when we talked to customers we heard a couple of things. One was that they really like their spending and investing to be sort of in their own lane. So separating out into a different balance was something that was very important as we rolled out the cash card. The other thing is just they need to have a reason to direct deposit into Robinhood. And I think having no fees with the cash card and having just a great customer experience is table stakes. We wanted to go beyond that and add really compelling debit card rewards as well as two-day early pay for the paycheck and the ability to seamlessly invest the paycheck into not just stocks, but also crypto. So I think as the equities and crypto offerings continue to mature and progress over time, and as we continue to add new products, this should spin the direct deposit flywheel as well. And there'll be more compelling reasons for customers to deposit their paychecks onto the platform. Thanks Josh. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Chris Koegel, Vice President of Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Jonathan, and thank you to everyone for joining Robinhood's Q4 Earnings Call. With us today are our CEO, and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev, and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor, are described in the press release we issued today, the earnings presentation, and our SEC filings all of which can be found at investors.robinhood.com. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. We're going to try something a little bit different today, I'm going to keep my remarks brief so that we can spend more time on Q&A. Robinhood is focused on three things. Number one, winning the active trader market. Two, increasing wallet share, as we deepen relationships with our customers. And three, expanding internationally. I first off want to congratulate our team for a strong 2023. Trading market share was up 14% for equities and 19% for options year-over-year. Gold subscribers were up 25% to 1.4 million and assets under custody exceeded $100 billion, fueled by the strength of our 27% organic growth in net deposits, and we've launched brokerage in the UK and crypto in the EU. A couple of points to call out. In Q4, we finished with $1.3 billion of net positive brokerage account transfers into Robinhood and we've already exceeded that total halfway through Q1. We've been taking trading market share for some time and now we're winning net asset inflows from every one of our major competitors, averaging over $100,000 per transfer. And as for funded customers, we've already grown more in the first half of Q1, than we did in each of the last eight quarters. So I love the momentum we're building and I'm excited about 2024. Before I discuss our roadmap, let's have Jason, review our financial results.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. We had a strong Q4 and 2023, and we have a lot of momentum starting 2024. Looking at 2023, we delivered significant profitable growth with record full-year revenues, record adjusted EBITDA, and record adjusted EBITDA margins. We grew revenues 37% to $1.9 billion, delivered adjusted EBITDA of $536 million, which is more than three times our prior high, drove 124% incremental margins as revenues grew by more than $500 million, even while we lowered costs. And we expanded adjusted EBITDA margins of 29%, as we make progress over time towards the 50% plus levels we see from incumbents. And looking at Q4, we delivered $0.03 of positive GAAP EPS. Aside from the regulatory charges last quarter, Q4 would have been our third straight quarter of positive earnings per share. Q4 was also our sixth straight quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. We're pleased with our results in 2023 and aim to continue delivering profitable growth in 2024. Let's move to our fourth quarter business results. Assets under custody finished Q4 back over $100 billion for the first time since 2021. We delivered strong Q4 net deposit growth at a 21% annualized rate. And we're focused on driving net deposits even higher by improving our user experience and value proposition. When we look at historical customer cohorts, we see they have consistently added to their net deposits over time, which we think provides a strong foundation for sustainable long-term asset growth. And newer cohorts are starting with balances, 1.5 to two times higher, which is even more encouraging. We're also delivering growth in Robinhood Gold. Compared to our average customer, Gold subscribers in Q4 had more than eight times the assets with an average of about $40,000, grew net deposits more than twice as fast, and have adopted our products at higher rates. Gold subscribers are up 25% year-over-year to 1.42 million. Gold ARPU is multiples of our average customer, which includes Q4 annualized recurring subscription revenue of $85 million. This Gold growth brings our adoption rate up to 6.1%. And we're working to take this even higher as we keep improving the value proposition. We also have strong momentum to start the year, as we added another 60,000 gold subscribers in January alone, that is nearly three times the monthly average we saw in 2023. Our team is also hard at work on new credit cards for Robinhood customers, starting with something special for Gold customers. Currently, for funded customers with our historical X1 credit card, they have an ARPU of over $300 on credit alone. That's nearly four times our current average. This represents another opportunity for us to diversify our business and introduce new products to our customers who have a median credit score of about 720 and two-thirds of whom are prime or prime plus. We look forward to sharing more about our plans with you soon. Now let's turn to financial results. In the fourth quarter, we generated net income of $30 million, as total net revenues increased 1% sequentially to $471 million and total expenses came in better than our outlook. Looking at Q4 revenues, transaction revenues increased as crypto notional volumes nearly doubled and other revenues grew as we saw early traction in Sherwood Media and added more Gold subscribers. These increases were partially offset by the anticipated decline in net interest revenues from lower sec lending demand across the industry. I'd also note that our monthly metrics now include total sec lending revenues. So investors have even more visibility into the drivers of our net interest revenues through the quarter. Looking at fourth quarter expenses, adjusted OpEx was $364 million, performing better than our outlook, even while we increased our growth investments. And for share-based compensation, it was $81 million, in line with our outlook. This combination drove Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $133 million, up 62% from a year ago. Now let's move to our 2024 outlook. We aim to deliver another year of revenue growth and margin expansion. Looking at revenues, with the current macro backdrop, we're planning for strong growth in 2024, driven by continued 20 plus percent net deposit growth, increasing Gold adoption, double-digit gains in trading market share, exciting new product introductions, and our diversified revenue model. And the year is off to a great start. January net deposits were nearly $4 billion, of which about one-third was net positive transfers in from other brokers. That January result was the highest monthly total since the first half of 2021, and we're seeing continued strength in early February. Looking at expenses, we plan to continue investing across new products, features, marketing, and international, while getting more efficient in our existing businesses and managing headcount growth all in to low-single digits. Our 2024 outlook for combined adjusted OpEx and share-based compensation is $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion, which is up 5% at the midpoint from last year's $1.81 billion, excluding the founder award cancellation. This range includes about $85 million of quarterly share-based compensation, similar to our run rate for the back half of 2023. As for timing, we anticipate Q1 will likely be in the upper half of our implied range as we lean into marketing investments to start the year. We also continue to closely manage our share count. In 2023, diluted share count decreased nearly 5% due to the purchase of 55 million shares in Q3. And in 2024, we expect to manage dilution to 2% or less. We believe this plan positions us to drive profitable growth again in 2024, as we grow revenues and expand margins. We'll have to see how the year plays out. But so far, we like the growth we're driving to start the year. I also wanted to share some perspective on the interest rate backdrop in 2024. First, when we look at the forward curve, the implied average fed funds rate in 2024 is roughly the same as it was in 2023, making rates a fairly neutral input for revenue year-over-year. Second, of our $30 billion-plus of interest-earning assets, less than half of that is rate-sensitive because we passed the vast majority of cash sweep interest onto our customers. So as rates move, we do not anticipate a significant change in the yield we earn on cash sweeps. And third, and most importantly, declining interest rates tend to support growth in assets, balances and trading. So we think 2024 is the year when we'll see interest rates shift from being a headwind for our business growth into a tailwind. In closing, we had a strong Q4 and 2023, and we have a lot of momentum to start the year. We remain focused on driving profitable growth for shareholders as we work to maximize EPS and free cash flow per share in 2024 and the years to come. Now, I will turn the call back to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Jason. As we entered the year, I want to highlight some of the areas we're most excited about to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. First, from winning the active trader market, we're going to continue to invest in our user experience on mobile where we're currently number one in market share. In addition, we will be launching a more feature-rich professional offering on the web for active traders. And we're also working on expanding our selection of tradable assets in particular with index options and futures coming later this year. Second, to grow wallet share, we're focused on increasing Gold memberships and net deposits. We plan to keep investing to make Robinhood Gold even more valuable for our customers and build off the early success of our retirement offering. At the same time, we also plan to launch new products like credit cards and add new account types such as joint accounts. And third, for international expansion, after launching crypto in the EU and brokerage in the UK, we have tens of thousands of international customers so far. What we're hearing from customers is that they want more of the full Robinhood product suite. So we're working to build that for them. We're also pursuing opportunities to expand into more jurisdictions. Reflecting on the past four years, we've tripled our customer base and grown revenues nearly seven times. And when we look, all that's in front of us, we're excited by the opportunity to continue growing Robinhood significantly from here. And we have a ton of momentum to start 2024. I want to thank our customers and team for a great 2023. The team has been working incredibly hard, the roadmap is full, there is so much to do. Now, let's move on to questions.\nA - Chris Koegel: Thank you, Vlad. For the Q&A session, we'll start by answering the top five shareholder questions from Say Technologies, ranked by number of votes. We have several questions that were already addressed on this call or in prior quarters and grouped together questions that share a common theme. After the Say questions, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So I'll kick it off with a first question from Say. This one is for Jason. Your stock price is down 70% since the IPO. What do you have in place to get your stock price back up? Is a dividend in the works to at least provide some return on investment?\nJason Warnick: Thanks for the question. We're hard at work on the inputs to driving value for shareholders. In 2023, we increased revenue by over $500 million and grew adjusted EBITDA even faster. And we're focused on driving revenues and profits higher in 2024. Over time, as we deliver on these inputs to the business, I think the stock price should follow. As for capital returns to shareholders, last year we bought back about 6% of our shares, and we'll continue to look for ways especially efficient ways to deploy our capital, including investments in growth, M&A to accelerate our roadmap or returns of capital to shareholders over time. But right now, to your question, we don't have any plans for dividends.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Jason. The next question is for Vlad. Vlad, what will it take to get Robinhood to the next level to start competing with Fidelity and the rest of the most common brokers?\nVlad Tenev: Thanks for the question. So for starters, I think Robinhood is already competing with Fidelity and the rest of the common brokers. If you look at active traders, we've been growing trading market share by double-digits. So that's not just volume and market share. We won head-to-head net asset transfers from all the other major brokerages in Q4, and that includes Fidelity. So that means that more assets actually flowed from Fidelity to Robinhood in Q4 than the other way around. And so to take it to the next level, we're really excited about our strategy. We think there is so much more to do for active traders. The roadmap is full and that includes investments across a slew of areas. One, making sure that the user experience remains best-in-class and continuing to invest there. Adding new product innovations that our competitors don't offer such as 24 Hour Market. New asset classes like futures which are active traders have been really excited about and asking for. And new account types and more of the table stakes features that, we just still have to get to. So there's a lot to do, and I should also mention, not a lot of the brokers have adopted new technologies like crypto. And that's an area where we're continuing to invest. And I see us extending our lead throughout 2024 and beyond. Increasing wallet share, we've talked a little bit about the success we're seeing in driving net account transfers from other brokers. We think that there's a lot of headroom. There is a lot of improvements in our passive offerings like retirement, the roadmap there is full and we're very excited about the credit card. In international, we did launch in the UK for brokerage, crypto for EU. That expands the addressable market quite dramatically. Not a lot of the common brokers even have an international presence to note. And I think over the couple -- over the next few years, we're making significant investments there. So, I think if we're successful executing on our strategy, you could see Robinhood winning by even larger margins going forward.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. The next question is for Jason. Jason, Robinhood has been profitable, often on. Do you see Robinhood joining the S&P 500 by qualifying and being profitable four quarters in a row?\nJason Warnick: We'd love to join the S&P 500 and I think we're focused on the right things to do that, delivering consistent profitability, growing revenues even higher. Remember though, there are only 500 spots on this and this is a committee decision. So it's not completely in our control, but we'll keep focused on our business, and over time it would be great to be part of that index.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Jason. The next question is for you, Vlad. What kind of progress should we expect from the company in 2024?\nVlad Tenev: So, I'll break it down into the three areas we're focused on. For winning in the active trader market, there is user experience improvements, new assets like futures and index options. As well, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier today, we've been doing very well on mobile, we're number one in market share there. Frankly on web, we haven't been doing as well and so we're making a big investment there and we're going to be launching a more professional offering geared toward active traders. So we're very excited about that. And as we continue to execute here, you should be able to track the progress and continued market-share gains across all the assets that we offer including equities, options, and crypto. For increasing wallet share, the credit card is something we're very excited about including a special credit card for Gold customers. There's more to do on Robinhood Gold in general and in retirement. And we'll also be building and offering new account types like joint accounts. And then you should be able to track progress there by looking at our net deposits and our Gold subscribers. And then expanding internationally, we launched in the EU for crypto and in the UK for brokerage. Really what we're focused in -- focusing on is delivering more features, making those experiences more feature-rich, and building on the initial UK and EU momentum that we've generated. And then what you should see there is an increase in the percentage of our funded customers that come from international markets, as well as new funded customer growth over time.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. And then, Vlad, this last Say question is, also for you. Please offer a yearly realized gain and loss tracker showing short and long-term gains. I've asked this in multiple earnings and currently have to track it manually in excel.\nVlad Tenev: Well, thank you for the feedback, and thanks for continuing to ask. There is an impact you asking because this is something that the team has actually been working towards. We're working hard to make great improvements to our tax law and P&L tracking this year and we hope you will like them. So stay tuned.\nChris Koegel: Alright. Thank you, Vlad. That concludes our shareholder questions from Say Technologies. We appreciate our shareholders taking time to ask these questions to Vlad and Jason, and look-forward to more next quarter. Now, I will return the call over to Jonathan to lead Q&A from our analysts.\nOperator: Certainly. Thank you. One moment for our first question. And our first question for today comes from the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Your question, please.\nDan Dolev: Hey, good evening. Amazing results, congratulations team, really good, making me proud.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you, Dan.\nDan Dolev: Of course, yes. So, I was actually really, really impressed by your comment, Vlad, about the $1.3 billion of net positive brokerage account transfer. To me it looks like you're gaining massive share. I know in the past, other brokers have said that they're taking share away from you. It looks like the tide is turning, like what are you seeing now?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I mean, we've been investing a lot in the user experience, we've been investing in the service. The product results speak for themselves. In Q4, we were net positive. So positive on a net basis for account transfers from every one of our major competitors. And these are big accounts coming in. So what's really amazing is, I think the new functionality that we've been operating and the service quality improvements have led to people being comfortable, moving in hundreds of thousands of dollars into Robinhood, which people wouldn't really talk about as much, but now it's becoming a destination for people's serious money. We're going to continue to double down on that. Again I want to emphasize, we're not getting complacent. There is a ton of work that remains to be done and to be able to deliver these types of results and see customers coming to us from all of our major competitors in Q4. And from what we've announced in so far in Q1 has just been a really positive and it's taken a ton of work from the team to both improve the product and service and get to where that's happening.\nDan Dolev: Amazing stuff. Can I squeeze in another quick question? I know it's early days, but how -- can you talk a little bit about progress in terms of accounts and traction you're getting in the UK because this is -- I think a huge opportunity for Robinhood, so I just wanted to see how those tractions has been going? And congrats again.\nVlad Tenev: All right. Yeah, no, we're very excited about that. A big part of our strategy is making Robinhood available to hundreds of millions of additional customers. And so, I think we've talked about tens of thousands of customers in the EU and the UK already. The UK is still rolling out. So we're working towards the app being generally available to any customer in the coming months. And we know we've got a lot of work to do. There is a lot of features that exist in the US, that our customers expect in these markets. And especially on the crypto side, there is going to be things that we can deliver in those markets that are not available in the US. So the roadmap is full and both the teams have been grinding exceptionally hard to improve the product at a very fast clip there.\nDan Dolev: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities. Your question, please.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Thanks so much. Hi, Vlad. Hi, Jason. How are you?\nVlad Tenev: I\u2019m great.\nJason Warnick: Hey, Devin.\nDevin Ryan: A question just on kind of interest rates in trading and appreciate kind of the inverse correlation that you talked about, obviously, sitting here today with materially higher customer cash balances. And as you mentioned you're passing along the majority of that benefit the clients. So if rates eventually do start to move lower, how are you guys thinking about the magnitude that could move back into the market from kind of those cash balances? And then just what the implications are on ARPU? Is that a net positive to ARPU or how should we think about the interplay to revenues?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, Devin. This is Jason. When we've looked at kind of the movement of trading activity, relative to interest rates moving up and down, we've seen a pretty strong inverse correlation there. And so we feel really good that we've got a nice natural hedge in the business between interest rates falling and interest in trading picking up. And so in my in my comments, I talked a bit about the passing along a big portion of the interest rates to customers on Gold suite. Looking at the average interest rates expected for '24 being roughly in line with '23, so we feel really good about that. And then as I mentioned kind of, most importantly, we think that falling interest rates create a tailwind for the business. So overall, we feel really good about delivering strong revenue growth in this current macro-environment.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Terrific. And then just a follow-up here just on expenses, obviously, I think the expense guide, 5% at the midpoint is very good. And you guys sound confident you can still fund all your growth initiatives. So how do you guys think about maybe core growth and expenses over the intermediate-term, maybe next three to five years? I would assume that it would be higher than that 5%. Maybe just walk us through some of the moving parts there. And then just the second part of the question is, just thoughts on leaning in more on marketing spend. I mean, you had a fantastic quarter. It sounds like you're having a lot of success with these promotions. And I\u2019m just curious if maybe makes sense to even lean in more there, because it would seem to pay off. It's very good with all the momentum you have there. Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Great question. So first of all, when we look at core expense growth this year, we actually have a plan to take that down high-single-digits, perhaps even 10%, and redirecting that spend to fund new growth initiatives. And then kind of looking out over the mid to longer-term, in terms of core growth, we think that could be low-single digits, perhaps even lower. There is still a lot of opportunity for us to drive efficiency in this business and we think we can maintain our core business and redirect the savings into growth initiatives over time. On your question about leaning more into marketing, you're on the same page as the management team. That is the plan this year and we are planning to spend up to about $100 million more in marketing in 2024, which is baked into this guidance. The team is really focused on bringing in high LTV customers with that spend and where we're liking kind of the early signals that we're seeing and so we want to lean in more there.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, that's really great color. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Devin.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Markgraf from KBCM. Your question, please.\nAlex Markgraf: Hey team. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to come back to the account transfer and some of the disclosure around the 1% bonus offering. Just wanted to understand how the average balance transfer, I think it was $100,000 kind of stacked up against your expectations for that campaign. And then, Vlad, with some of your comments earlier, I mean, is that directionally kind of the new normal in some of these transfer campaigns or how should we think about that?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. So I would just say looking back, over the past 10 years, we've taken market share of the trading activity. Now we're coming for the assets too. So our focus is increasingly going to be on driving asset growth. We just completed the 1% promo for ACATS in taxable brokerage accounts. We saw over $3 billion in ACATS in from that. And now we're turning our focus on the 3% retirement promotion on rollovers and transfers for retirement accounts that runs through tax season. On average, as you pointed out, the customer is transferring assets over a much larger than kind of the average account size. And we're really excited about the momentum that's giving us to start the year.\nAlex Markgraf: And maybe if I could just squeeze in one more. Any sort of color or observations you could share with us, the interplay between some of the spot, Bitcoin ETFs that were made available in the early part of the year as opposed to direct Bitcoin ownership?\nJason Warnick: Hey, Alex, this is Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. So we're really pleased to be offering all 11 of the Bitcoin ETFs on the first day of trading, I think that was a great outcome for customers. So far we're seeing nice interest in the ETFs, but we think it's additive. About 5% of our overall trading in crypto is through the ETF, with 95% still being on spot trading through the crypto business, and that's stabilized. So we feel really good to offer the selection for customers. We think it increases overall market interest in crypto and also brings liquidity to the market. So net-net, we're really pleased with the Bitcoin ETFs.\nAlex Markgraf: Great. Thanks for all the detail.\nJason Warnick: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nWill Nance: Hey, guys. I appreciate you taking the question.\nVlad Tenev: Hey, Will.\nWill Nance: Yes, well, I know in the prepared remarks, we're talking about, continued revenue growth and margin expansion for the year. And it sounds like that's the assumption is, it's probably coming on the revenue side more from the trading side than from NII, given the commentary around rates sort of being a push. So correct me if I'm wrong there, if you -- if there's like an assumption around better earning asset growth. But I guess my thought -- my question would be, in the earlier response to one of the questions, it sounds like there's actually a lot more growth-related investments happening underneath the surface in this expense guide, and you guys are funding that with continued operational efficiencies and doing what you guys have done an amazing job over the past two years of doing and rightsizing the expense base. So just -- maybe can you talk about sort of how much of that growth related investments is sort of discretionary? And if we do see some kind of reduction in either near-term trading activity? I know we saw a very nice increase and it seems like both options and crypto towards the end of the year. How -- what kind of flex is there in those growth-related investments?\nJason Warnick: Yeah. I mean I think marketing is almost always considered a discretionary spend. And so as I mentioned in my earlier response that we're leaning into marketing, that is always up to reevaluation, up or down, depending on the macro backdrop, how that changes and also how effective the marketing spend is. And so we'll continue to see how that plays out. and update as we go. In terms of the cost savings that we're realizing in our core business, I said high single digits to perhaps even 10% of cost reduction there. And we're redeploying that into new areas of our business, areas that Vlad was highlighting earlier. New growth is certainly discretionary. I'd say that we've decided, though, that we're pursuing these growth opportunities. And so I wouldn't expect us to pull back there certainly in 2024. And Will, you did say rates are a push, and I agree with that. I would say that we also continue to see strong kind of double-digit growth in net deposits. And so assets continue to improve year-over-year, and we're certainly starting with a higher balance at the beginning of '24 than what we saw in '23.\nWill Nance: Yeah. All that makes sense. And then just questions around -- your thought process around the European expansion over the course of this year. what does that play into expectations, if any? And what's the latest thinking on when this could be a more meaningful part of the story over time? Thanks for taking the questions.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, I'll take that one. While it's still early, we really like the initial traction we're seeing. We're already seeing a healthy portion of our user growth coming from outside of the US. And our focus now is really rounding out the product suite, bringing more services to customers across the globe. We think there's a huge opportunity for international to become a big part of our business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for four next question. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your question please.\nMichael Anagnostakis: Hey, good afternoon. This is Michael Anagnostakis filling in for Stephen. I just wanted to\u2026\nVlad Tenev: Michael.\nMichael Anagnostakis: Hey glad. How are you doing? So good to hear. I just want touch on sec lend here.. Could you give us an update on where you are in the journey for the fully paid program, how much incremental penetration you think you can drive? And given the uptick has been obscured by what's a challenging backdrop, can you remind investors what you think that business can deliver from a revenue perspective in a more normal environment? Thanks.\nJason Warnick: Yeah. Thanks, Michael, for the question. We're really pleased with the progress that we're making on the inputs of the securities lending business, particularly fully paid securities lending equities enrolled in the program increased from Q3 to Q4 from $10 billion to $14 billion. So really, really pleased with that, added 500,000 customers into the program a sequential quarter basis. I still think that there's quite a bit of headroom for us to continue to penetrate and get securities lending fully paid into the hands of our customers. It's a great way to augment yield, as we all know, and the team is hard at work to make sure customers understand that. I think that's showing up in the progress that we're making. At the at the moment, the rebate rates that we're seeing are lower across the industry. But over time, I think as that normalizes a bit, the progress that we're making on inputs is really going to show through from a revenue basis.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, we think we still have room to run and we could make meaningful progress towards heightened penetration this year.\nMichael Anagnostakis: Got it. Thank you. And then I guess my follow-up, I wanted to briefly hit on expenses again, maybe in a different vein. Now that the headcount reductions are largely in the rear view, how should we be thinking about the direction of travel for expense per head given the scalability of Robinhood coupled with the investments you're making, particularly international, where I imagine that may drive some incremental headcount growth? Thanks.\nJason Warnick: Yeah. So the plan on headcount is to be roughly flat to slightly up this year. So we feel really good about the head count posture that we have. In terms of the expense per head, there does continue to be opportunity for us to get even more efficient. Today, the vast majority of our of our head count is in higher cost US geographies, and there's opportunity there over time. I think the real opportunity for us on head count is really just increasing revenue per employee. And there, we feel like we're just getting started. There's a lot of opportunity for us to leverage the fixed cost infrastructure that we have at the company as we grow the business over time.\nMichael Anagnostakis: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJason Warnick: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good evening, and thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask about crypto, an area you guys continue to invest in. I was hoping you could elaborate on the investments you're looking to make here in '24 and beyond, as well as how you envision crypto contributing to your business as you look out over the next three to five years.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I mean, we\u2019re investing a larger amount into crypto, both in the EU and domestically. I think there is a ton of improvements left to make. Last year we were really focusing on the trader experience and providing clarity, which we believe we've made significant progress on, in just how much better our pricing is than that of our competitors. And we've seen that reflected in crypto trading market share. We've also seen, and you probably caught this announcement just in the past couple of days, our on-ramp technology of Robinhood Connect. We've been making meaningful progress there. And so if you think about all that we have to be really, really good at to power our retail crypto offering, we've gotten really good at quick money movements, getting your fiat dollars into crypto, as seamlessly as possible through building out our transfers products. Delivering those funds into non-custodial wallets seamlessly. And so Robinhood Connect really leverages that and turns that into a powerful B2B product. We announced a partnership with MetaMask a couple of days ago, and that's been one of the market leaders in non-custodial wallets. And they do a really nice thing where you can actually compare the use of different on-ramps, and they sort it by which one is the most cost-effective. And when you kind of look on that page, you see Robinhood at the top. So I think it really shows the investments that we've made in our platform, and it's reflected in us being able to offer lower cost, not just for our consumers, but for business partners as well. And I think you'll see us chipping away at this bit by bit. We think we can be the leading player in bridging the worlds of traditional finance and crypto. So there's a lot more where that came from.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Just a follow-up question if I could. On the expense side, you guys continue to drive efficiency in the business. I heard you mentioned you can reduce underlying costs in '24 by up to 10% or so, understanding you took to reinvest that elsewhere. But -- and over the medium-term, you could potentially look to grow expenses at a low-single-digit pace. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate on the top contributors to that level of efficiency, the specific steps you're taking here in '24, and how those may -- those steps may differ as you look out over the medium-term to hit those particular targets if you want.\nJason Warnick: Yeah. Sure. I mean, we've been really kind of fine-tuning our skills over the last couple of years in terms of efficiency. We are focused on business process efficiency using technology. We have a team that we have spun up that helps the business, find opportunities to improve efficiency. One project we just finished was on recruiting. And we think we can save 20% to 40% of our time just on the recruiting process from optimizing our business steps that are involved. As I mentioned earlier, I think there is a opportunity for us over time in terms of place of work, with the vast majority of our employees working in high-cost locations within the US. That's something that we can make progress on in '24, as well as beyond. So those are the big levers that I'd point to.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of John Todaro from Needham & Company. Your question, please.\nJohn Todaro: Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the beats. I guess, I have two here, both on the crypto components. The Bitcoin ETF versus buying Bitcoin directly on the platform, you had mentioned earlier about 5% of overall crypto you thought was flowing into the ETF. So, was that 5% that migrated away from buying Bitcoin directly or was that an additive 5%?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, we saw it was mostly additive. There were some traders that sold out a spot and got to ETF, but that was really more of the exception. And we also offer the ETFs in our retirement accounts, which accounted for some of the pickup as well. So overall, we don't view this as cannibalization. It's additive and we think it's really good for customers as well.\nJohn Todaro: Great. Thanks for that. And then just one more on the MetaMask integration. I think that's really interesting. It does kind of pivot Robinhood to be more of that fiat onramp to the ecosystem defi on chain stuff. Just curious though, what is kind of the monetization strategy with that integration, short term and then longer term?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, so we collect fees on the activity of the on-ramp, so that's the primary source of monetization. And then any trading on our platform for that on-ramp also would show up in our transaction-based revenues.\nJohn Todaro: Got it. Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Your question, please.\nPatrick Moley: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I just had one on Robinhood Gold. Just hoping you could update us kind of on how you think about pricing there. With the expanded offerings that you're adding, $5 a month seems like somewhat of an inexpensive price to pay. So just hoping you could update us on your thoughts there. And then maybe as we look internationally, how you sort of think about taking the subscription model overseas and how you see that playing out with a different kind of geographic customer mix. Thanks.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, this is Jason, I'll start and we'll see if that has any additional color. We love the Gold program, Gold members have an ARPU that's multiples of our average ARPU. And you're right, the $5 a month it's just a screaming deal. We want it to be obvious for every customer that they should be a Gold subscriber. So we're paying close attention to the behavior of Gold. They're bringing in more net deposits, they're using more of our products, and they do all that with a relatively modest monthly subscription. We'll evaluate pricing over time. But all in, we just love the economics of the Gold subscription. And I do think over time there is an opportunity for us to take Robinhood Gold internationally.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I don't have much to add there. I think that other financial service companies offer these Gold perks to their high net worth customers. And usually, there is balance requirements. You have to have millions of dollars in your account. And so we think it's very mission-aligned to provide those same types of services to any customer for such a small monthly fee. I think it really has the potential to disrupt the wealth management industry just in the same way that we've been disrupting trading. And our focus has been on making the experience even better, getting the adoption rate up, making it easy for new customers in particular to onboard onto the product. We've seen really healthy improvements in sort of like the first week attach rate of Gold among new customers. And we think that there is further improvements and we've got a lot slated for this year to make the Gold offering even better.\nPatrick Moley: Okay, that's great color. And then just a follow-up on the equities and options take rate, those have been coming down for the last couple of quarters. Options fee capture seemed to stabilize somewhat in the fourth quarter. Equities declined again. So just kind of as we look out to the next year, how do you think -- or how do you see the take rates there kind of --what's the trajectory over next couple of quarters? I guess, is the question. Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, you bet, I'd zero in on options for that. For the back half of the year both Q3 and Q4, we were running at $0.41 per contract. And in January, we're in that zone, but the mix is improving a bit. So we'll have to see how the year plays out and nothing really to highlight on the equity side.\nPatrick Moley: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your question, please.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. As we look to election season in the SEC, do you expect the SEC will execute on the market structure changes proposed last year for equity markets? And if so, do you think there -- that equity market structure changes will differ from the original proposals or are they likely to stay on track? And which are kind of most important to Robinhood here?\nJason Warnick: So, we think a fair amount will probably be executed heading up into the election season. I think BestX is an important aspect to that. We participated in the comment process and we feel like a fair number of our comments were incorporated, and that's baked into, really the expectations that we have for 2024.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then on TOAs, you mentioned that the TOAs are positive for the major brokers. Are you seeing positive transfer of assets from the major crypto providers as well?\nVlad Tenev: So it's a little bit difficult to reconcile the crypto activity in that way because a lot of people use crypto or Robinhood as an on-ramp to transfer, to purchase crypto, and then kind of use it in the Web3 ecosystem. So it's a little bit different of a behavior than brokerage ACAP transfers, where those assets tend to sit and accumulate. So I don't think you can make really a apples to apples comparison.\nJason Warnick: The one thing, Ken, that I'd highlight is that the crypto volume on Robinhood nearly doubled in Q4. So really seeing strong engagement and increasing market share.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Your question, please.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi, good evening, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on an earlier question about taking the subscription model overseas. Maybe can you talk a little bit about, now that you're rolling out in the UK, what the revenue model looks like over there? I mean, I think we all understand it will look somewhat different than the US, but can you kind of give us -- any kind of color on what that should look like as the platform ramps over there? What are the kind of main sources of revenues? Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, Ben, I'd say in the UK we know that payment for order flow isn't allowed, but really all of the other income streams are available there over time. So margin, fully paid securities lending, certainly interest on cash. And so I would say, as we look internationally, the revenue characteristics and ARPU in some jurisdictions will be a little higher than the US, some a little lower. But on average, we think that the income potential is pretty much on par with what we're seeing in the US.\nVlad Tenev: And we know that market in particular is very used to subscription products. So we're definitely hard at work, crafting a great Gold experience for international.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, and remember that payment for order flow is actually a pretty modest portion of our revenue for equities trading in the US. And so not having that in the UK is not a big concern.\nBenjamin Budish: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe one follow-up, maybe sort of connected. Can you talk about the activity you're seeing in your 24 Hour Market? I know some of the appeal is for overseas investors who are far away in different time zones. But you've talked in the past about expanding access outside of the traditional trading hours. So what sort of activity are you seeing there? What kind of uplift might you see as you kind of continue to rollout more stocks to that offering? Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I think the team has done tremendous work making the 24 Hour Market offering better and better. We started with a pretty limited set of names, roughly a year ago. They've been adding names by the hundreds, so we have somewhere around 900 tickers available in the overnight trading session. Hundreds of thousands of our customers have used the product and we've seen particularly strong activity around earnings, when really, Robinhood is among the only places available to trade some of these tickers. So we're going to continue to invest there. I think there's a lot to do, particularly as we improve the active trading tooling and offerings because this product is resonating particularly well among our key active trader customers.\nBenjamin Budish: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Vlad Tenev for any further remarks.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. Thank you all. Great questions. And the team is already hard at work getting 2024 started. So not much holiday rest here for Robinhood. We look forward to seeing you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. We're going to try something a little bit different today, I'm going to keep my remarks brief so that we can spend more time on Q&A. Robinhood is focused on three things. Number one, winning the active trader market. Two, increasing wallet share, as we deepen relationships with our customers. And three, expanding internationally. I first off want to congratulate our team for a strong 2023. Trading market share was up 14% for equities and 19% for options year-over-year. Gold subscribers were up 25% to 1.4 million and assets under custody exceeded $100 billion, fueled by the strength of our 27% organic growth in net deposits, and we've launched brokerage in the UK and crypto in the EU. A couple of points to call out. In Q4, we finished with $1.3 billion of net positive brokerage account transfers into Robinhood and we've already exceeded that total halfway through Q1. We've been taking trading market share for some time and now we're winning net asset inflows from every one of our major competitors, averaging over $100,000 per transfer. And as for funded customers, we've already grown more in the first half of Q1, than we did in each of the last eight quarters. So I love the momentum we're building and I'm excited about 2024. Before I discuss our roadmap, let's have Jason, review our financial results. Thanks, Jason. As we entered the year, I want to highlight some of the areas we're most excited about to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. First, from winning the active trader market, we're going to continue to invest in our user experience on mobile where we're currently number one in market share. In addition, we will be launching a more feature-rich professional offering on the web for active traders. And we're also working on expanding our selection of tradable assets in particular with index options and futures coming later this year. Second, to grow wallet share, we're focused on increasing Gold memberships and net deposits. We plan to keep investing to make Robinhood Gold even more valuable for our customers and build off the early success of our retirement offering. At the same time, we also plan to launch new products like credit cards and add new account types such as joint accounts. And third, for international expansion, after launching crypto in the EU and brokerage in the UK, we have tens of thousands of international customers so far. What we're hearing from customers is that they want more of the full Robinhood product suite. So we're working to build that for them. We're also pursuing opportunities to expand into more jurisdictions. Reflecting on the past four years, we've tripled our customer base and grown revenues nearly seven times. And when we look, all that's in front of us, we're excited by the opportunity to continue growing Robinhood significantly from here. And we have a ton of momentum to start 2024. I want to thank our customers and team for a great 2023. The team has been working incredibly hard, the roadmap is full, there is so much to do. Now, let's move on to questions. Thanks for the question. So for starters, I think Robinhood is already competing with Fidelity and the rest of the common brokers. If you look at active traders, we've been growing trading market share by double-digits. So that's not just volume and market share. We won head-to-head net asset transfers from all the other major brokerages in Q4, and that includes Fidelity. So that means that more assets actually flowed from Fidelity to Robinhood in Q4 than the other way around. And so to take it to the next level, we're really excited about our strategy. We think there is so much more to do for active traders. The roadmap is full and that includes investments across a slew of areas. One, making sure that the user experience remains best-in-class and continuing to invest there. Adding new product innovations that our competitors don't offer such as 24 Hour Market. New asset classes like futures which are active traders have been really excited about and asking for. And new account types and more of the table stakes features that, we just still have to get to. So there's a lot to do, and I should also mention, not a lot of the brokers have adopted new technologies like crypto. And that's an area where we're continuing to invest. And I see us extending our lead throughout 2024 and beyond. Increasing wallet share, we've talked a little bit about the success we're seeing in driving net account transfers from other brokers. We think that there's a lot of headroom. There is a lot of improvements in our passive offerings like retirement, the roadmap there is full and we're very excited about the credit card. In international, we did launch in the UK for brokerage, crypto for EU. That expands the addressable market quite dramatically. Not a lot of the common brokers even have an international presence to note. And I think over the couple -- over the next few years, we're making significant investments there. So, I think if we're successful executing on our strategy, you could see Robinhood winning by even larger margins going forward. So, I'll break it down into the three areas we're focused on. For winning in the active trader market, there is user experience improvements, new assets like futures and index options. As well, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier today, we've been doing very well on mobile, we're number one in market share there. Frankly on web, we haven't been doing as well and so we're making a big investment there and we're going to be launching a more professional offering geared toward active traders. So we're very excited about that. And as we continue to execute here, you should be able to track the progress and continued market-share gains across all the assets that we offer including equities, options, and crypto. For increasing wallet share, the credit card is something we're very excited about including a special credit card for Gold customers. There's more to do on Robinhood Gold in general and in retirement. And we'll also be building and offering new account types like joint accounts. And then you should be able to track progress there by looking at our net deposits and our Gold subscribers. And then expanding internationally, we launched in the EU for crypto and in the UK for brokerage. Really what we're focused in -- focusing on is delivering more features, making those experiences more feature-rich, and building on the initial UK and EU momentum that we've generated. And then what you should see there is an increase in the percentage of our funded customers that come from international markets, as well as new funded customer growth over time. Well, thank you for the feedback, and thanks for continuing to ask. There is an impact you asking because this is something that the team has actually been working towards. We're working hard to make great improvements to our tax law and P&L tracking this year and we hope you will like them. So stay tuned. Thank you, Dan. Yeah. I mean, we've been investing a lot in the user experience, we've been investing in the service. The product results speak for themselves. In Q4, we were net positive. So positive on a net basis for account transfers from every one of our major competitors. And these are big accounts coming in. So what's really amazing is, I think the new functionality that we've been operating and the service quality improvements have led to people being comfortable, moving in hundreds of thousands of dollars into Robinhood, which people wouldn't really talk about as much, but now it's becoming a destination for people's serious money. We're going to continue to double down on that. Again I want to emphasize, we're not getting complacent. There is a ton of work that remains to be done and to be able to deliver these types of results and see customers coming to us from all of our major competitors in Q4. And from what we've announced in so far in Q1 has just been a really positive and it's taken a ton of work from the team to both improve the product and service and get to where that's happening. All right. Yeah, no, we're very excited about that. A big part of our strategy is making Robinhood available to hundreds of millions of additional customers. And so, I think we've talked about tens of thousands of customers in the EU and the UK already. The UK is still rolling out. So we're working towards the app being generally available to any customer in the coming months. And we know we've got a lot of work to do. There is a lot of features that exist in the US, that our customers expect in these markets. And especially on the crypto side, there is going to be things that we can deliver in those markets that are not available in the US. So the roadmap is full and both the teams have been grinding exceptionally hard to improve the product at a very fast clip there. I'm great. Yeah. So I would just say looking back, over the past 10 years, we've taken market share of the trading activity. Now we're coming for the assets too. So our focus is increasingly going to be on driving asset growth. We just completed the 1% promo for ACATS in taxable brokerage accounts. We saw over $3 billion in ACATS in from that. And now we're turning our focus on the 3% retirement promotion on rollovers and transfers for retirement accounts that runs through tax season. On average, as you pointed out, the customer is transferring assets over a much larger than kind of the average account size. And we're really excited about the momentum that's giving us to start the year. Hey, Will. Yeah, I'll take that one. While it's still early, we really like the initial traction we're seeing. We're already seeing a healthy portion of our user growth coming from outside of the US. And our focus now is really rounding out the product suite, bringing more services to customers across the globe. We think there's a huge opportunity for international to become a big part of our business. Michael. Yeah, we think we still have room to run and we could make meaningful progress towards heightened penetration this year. Yeah. I mean, we're investing a larger amount into crypto, both in the EU and domestically. I think there is a ton of improvements left to make. Last year we were really focusing on the trader experience and providing clarity, which we believe we've made significant progress on, in just how much better our pricing is than that of our competitors. And we've seen that reflected in crypto trading market share. We've also seen, and you probably caught this announcement just in the past couple of days, our on-ramp technology of Robinhood Connect. We've been making meaningful progress there. And so if you think about all that we have to be really, really good at to power our retail crypto offering, we've gotten really good at quick money movements, getting your fiat dollars into crypto, as seamlessly as possible through building out our transfers products. Delivering those funds into non-custodial wallets seamlessly. And so Robinhood Connect really leverages that and turns that into a powerful B2B product. We announced a partnership with MetaMask a couple of days ago, and that's been one of the market leaders in non-custodial wallets. And they do a really nice thing where you can actually compare the use of different on-ramps, and they sort it by which one is the most cost-effective. And when you kind of look on that page, you see Robinhood at the top. So I think it really shows the investments that we've made in our platform, and it's reflected in us being able to offer lower cost, not just for our consumers, but for business partners as well. And I think you'll see us chipping away at this bit by bit. We think we can be the leading player in bridging the worlds of traditional finance and crypto. So there's a lot more where that came from. Yeah, so we collect fees on the activity of the on-ramp, so that's the primary source of monetization. And then any trading on our platform for that on-ramp also would show up in our transaction-based revenues. Yeah. I don't have much to add there. I think that other financial service companies offer these Gold perks to their high net worth customers. And usually, there is balance requirements. You have to have millions of dollars in your account. And so we think it's very mission-aligned to provide those same types of services to any customer for such a small monthly fee. I think it really has the potential to disrupt the wealth management industry just in the same way that we've been disrupting trading. And our focus has been on making the experience even better, getting the adoption rate up, making it easy for new customers in particular to onboard onto the product. We've seen really healthy improvements in sort of like the first week attach rate of Gold among new customers. And we think that there is further improvements and we've got a lot slated for this year to make the Gold offering even better. Yeah, you bet, I'd zero in on options for that. For the back half of the year both Q3 and Q4, we were running at $0.41 per contract. And in January, we're in that zone, but the mix is improving a bit. So we'll have to see how the year plays out and nothing really to highlight on the equity side. Thank you. So it's a little bit difficult to reconcile the crypto activity in that way because a lot of people use crypto or Robinhood as an on-ramp to transfer, to purchase crypto, and then kind of use it in the Web3 ecosystem. So it's a little bit different of a behavior than brokerage ACAP transfers, where those assets tend to sit and accumulate. So I don't think you can make really a apples to apples comparison. And we know that market in particular is very used to subscription products. So we're definitely hard at work, crafting a great Gold experience for international. Yeah. I think the team has done tremendous work making the 24 Hour Market offering better and better. We started with a pretty limited set of names, roughly a year ago. They've been adding names by the hundreds, so we have somewhere around 900 tickers available in the overnight trading session. Hundreds of thousands of our customers have used the product and we've seen particularly strong activity around earnings, when really, Robinhood is among the only places available to trade some of these tickers. So we're going to continue to invest there. I think there's a lot to do, particularly as we improve the active trading tooling and offerings because this product is resonating particularly well among our key active trader customers. Yeah. Thank you all. Great questions. And the team is already hard at work getting 2024 started. So not much holiday rest here for Robinhood. We look forward to seeing you next quarter."

            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. We had a strong Q4 and 2023, and we have a lot of momentum starting 2024. Looking at 2023, we delivered significant profitable growth with record full-year revenues, record adjusted EBITDA, and record adjusted EBITDA margins. We grew revenues 37% to $1.9 billion, delivered adjusted EBITDA of $536 million, which is more than three times our prior high, drove 124% incremental margins as revenues grew by more than $500 million, even while we lowered costs. And we expanded adjusted EBITDA margins of 29%, as we make progress over time towards the 50% plus levels we see from incumbents. And looking at Q4, we delivered $0.03 of positive GAAP EPS. Aside from the regulatory charges last quarter, Q4 would have been our third straight quarter of positive earnings per share. Q4 was also our sixth straight quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. We're pleased with our results in 2023 and aim to continue delivering profitable growth in 2024. Let's move to our fourth quarter business results. Assets under custody finished Q4 back over $100 billion for the first time since 2021. We delivered strong Q4 net deposit growth at a 21% annualized rate. And we're focused on driving net deposits even higher by improving our user experience and value proposition. When we look at historical customer cohorts, we see they have consistently added to their net deposits over time, which we think provides a strong foundation for sustainable long-term asset growth. And newer cohorts are starting with balances, 1.5 to two times higher, which is even more encouraging. We're also delivering growth in Robinhood Gold. Compared to our average customer, Gold subscribers in Q4 had more than eight times the assets with an average of about $40,000, grew net deposits more than twice as fast, and have adopted our products at higher rates. Gold subscribers are up 25% year-over-year to 1.42 million. Gold ARPU is multiples of our average customer, which includes Q4 annualized recurring subscription revenue of $85 million. This Gold growth brings our adoption rate up to 6.1%. And we're working to take this even higher as we keep improving the value proposition. We also have strong momentum to start the year, as we added another 60,000 gold subscribers in January alone, that is nearly three times the monthly average we saw in 2023. Our team is also hard at work on new credit cards for Robinhood customers, starting with something special for Gold customers. Currently, for funded customers with our historical X1 credit card, they have an ARPU of over $300 on credit alone. That's nearly four times our current average. This represents another opportunity for us to diversify our business and introduce new products to our customers who have a median credit score of about 720 and two-thirds of whom are prime or prime plus. We look forward to sharing more about our plans with you soon. Now let's turn to financial results. In the fourth quarter, we generated net income of $30 million, as total net revenues increased 1% sequentially to $471 million and total expenses came in better than our outlook. Looking at Q4 revenues, transaction revenues increased as crypto notional volumes nearly doubled and other revenues grew as we saw early traction in Sherwood Media and added more Gold subscribers. These increases were partially offset by the anticipated decline in net interest revenues from lower sec lending demand across the industry. I'd also note that our monthly metrics now include total sec lending revenues. So investors have even more visibility into the drivers of our net interest revenues through the quarter. Looking at fourth quarter expenses, adjusted OpEx was $364 million, performing better than our outlook, even while we increased our growth investments. And for share-based compensation, it was $81 million, in line with our outlook. This combination drove Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $133 million, up 62% from a year ago. Now let's move to our 2024 outlook. We aim to deliver another year of revenue growth and margin expansion. Looking at revenues, with the current macro backdrop, we're planning for strong growth in 2024, driven by continued 20 plus percent net deposit growth, increasing Gold adoption, double-digit gains in trading market share, exciting new product introductions, and our diversified revenue model. And the year is off to a great start. January net deposits were nearly $4 billion, of which about one-third was net positive transfers in from other brokers. That January result was the highest monthly total since the first half of 2021, and we're seeing continued strength in early February. Looking at expenses, we plan to continue investing across new products, features, marketing, and international, while getting more efficient in our existing businesses and managing headcount growth all in to low-single digits. Our 2024 outlook for combined adjusted OpEx and share-based compensation is $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion, which is up 5% at the midpoint from last year's $1.81 billion, excluding the founder award cancellation. This range includes about $85 million of quarterly share-based compensation, similar to our run rate for the back half of 2023. As for timing, we anticipate Q1 will likely be in the upper half of our implied range as we lean into marketing investments to start the year. We also continue to closely manage our share count. In 2023, diluted share count decreased nearly 5% due to the purchase of 55 million shares in Q3. And in 2024, we expect to manage dilution to 2% or less. We believe this plan positions us to drive profitable growth again in 2024, as we grow revenues and expand margins. We'll have to see how the year plays out. But so far, we like the growth we're driving to start the year. I also wanted to share some perspective on the interest rate backdrop in 2024. First, when we look at the forward curve, the implied average fed funds rate in 2024 is roughly the same as it was in 2023, making rates a fairly neutral input for revenue year-over-year. Second, of our $30 billion-plus of interest-earning assets, less than half of that is rate-sensitive because we passed the vast majority of cash sweep interest onto our customers. So as rates move, we do not anticipate a significant change in the yield we earn on cash sweeps. And third, and most importantly, declining interest rates tend to support growth in assets, balances and trading. So we think 2024 is the year when we'll see interest rates shift from being a headwind for our business growth into a tailwind. In closing, we had a strong Q4 and 2023, and we have a lot of momentum to start the year. We remain focused on driving profitable growth for shareholders as we work to maximize EPS and free cash flow per share in 2024 and the years to come. Now, I will turn the call back to Vlad. Thanks for the question. We're hard at work on the inputs to driving value for shareholders. In 2023, we increased revenue by over $500 million and grew adjusted EBITDA even faster. And we're focused on driving revenues and profits higher in 2024. Over time, as we deliver on these inputs to the business, I think the stock price should follow. As for capital returns to shareholders, last year we bought back about 6% of our shares, and we'll continue to look for ways especially efficient ways to deploy our capital, including investments in growth, M&A to accelerate our roadmap or returns of capital to shareholders over time. But right now, to your question, we don't have any plans for dividends. We'd love to join the S&P 500 and I think we're focused on the right things to do that, delivering consistent profitability, growing revenues even higher. Remember though, there are only 500 spots on this and this is a committee decision. So it's not completely in our control, but we'll keep focused on our business, and over time it would be great to be part of that index. Hey, Devin. Yeah, Devin. This is Jason. When we've looked at kind of the movement of trading activity, relative to interest rates moving up and down, we've seen a pretty strong inverse correlation there. And so we feel really good that we've got a nice natural hedge in the business between interest rates falling and interest in trading picking up. And so in my in my comments, I talked a bit about the passing along a big portion of the interest rates to customers on Gold suite. Looking at the average interest rates expected for '24 being roughly in line with '23, so we feel really good about that. And then as I mentioned kind of, most importantly, we think that falling interest rates create a tailwind for the business. So overall, we feel really good about delivering strong revenue growth in this current macro-environment. Great question. So first of all, when we look at core expense growth this year, we actually have a plan to take that down high-single-digits, perhaps even 10%, and redirecting that spend to fund new growth initiatives. And then kind of looking out over the mid to longer-term, in terms of core growth, we think that could be low-single digits, perhaps even lower. There is still a lot of opportunity for us to drive efficiency in this business and we think we can maintain our core business and redirect the savings into growth initiatives over time. On your question about leaning more into marketing, you're on the same page as the management team. That is the plan this year and we are planning to spend up to about $100 million more in marketing in 2024, which is baked into this guidance. The team is really focused on bringing in high LTV customers with that spend and where we're liking kind of the early signals that we're seeing and so we want to lean in more there. Thanks, Devin. Hey, Alex, this is Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. So we're really pleased to be offering all 11 of the Bitcoin ETFs on the first day of trading, I think that was a great outcome for customers. So far we're seeing nice interest in the ETFs, but we think it's additive. About 5% of our overall trading in crypto is through the ETF, with 95% still being on spot trading through the crypto business, and that's stabilized. So we feel really good to offer the selection for customers. We think it increases overall market interest in crypto and also brings liquidity to the market. So net-net, we're really pleased with the Bitcoin ETFs. You bet. Yeah. I mean I think marketing is almost always considered a discretionary spend. And so as I mentioned in my earlier response that we're leaning into marketing, that is always up to reevaluation, up or down, depending on the macro backdrop, how that changes and also how effective the marketing spend is. And so we'll continue to see how that plays out. and update as we go. In terms of the cost savings that we're realizing in our core business, I said high single digits to perhaps even 10% of cost reduction there. And we're redeploying that into new areas of our business, areas that Vlad was highlighting earlier. New growth is certainly discretionary. I'd say that we've decided, though, that we're pursuing these growth opportunities. And so I wouldn't expect us to pull back there certainly in 2024. And Will, you did say rates are a push, and I agree with that. I would say that we also continue to see strong kind of double-digit growth in net deposits. And so assets continue to improve year-over-year, and we're certainly starting with a higher balance at the beginning of '24 than what we saw in '23. Yeah. Thanks, Michael, for the question. We're really pleased with the progress that we're making on the inputs of the securities lending business, particularly fully paid securities lending equities enrolled in the program increased from Q3 to Q4 from $10 billion to $14 billion. So really, really pleased with that, added 500,000 customers into the program a sequential quarter basis. I still think that there's quite a bit of headroom for us to continue to penetrate and get securities lending fully paid into the hands of our customers. It's a great way to augment yield, as we all know, and the team is hard at work to make sure customers understand that. I think that's showing up in the progress that we're making. At the at the moment, the rebate rates that we're seeing are lower across the industry. But over time, I think as that normalizes a bit, the progress that we're making on inputs is really going to show through from a revenue basis. Yeah. So the plan on headcount is to be roughly flat to slightly up this year. So we feel really good about the head count posture that we have. In terms of the expense per head, there does continue to be opportunity for us to get even more efficient. Today, the vast majority of our of our head count is in higher cost US geographies, and there's opportunity there over time. I think the real opportunity for us on head count is really just increasing revenue per employee. And there, we feel like we're just getting started. There's a lot of opportunity for us to leverage the fixed cost infrastructure that we have at the company as we grow the business over time. You bet. Yeah. Sure. I mean, we've been really kind of fine-tuning our skills over the last couple of years in terms of efficiency. We are focused on business process efficiency using technology. We have a team that we have spun up that helps the business, find opportunities to improve efficiency. One project we just finished was on recruiting. And we think we can save 20% to 40% of our time just on the recruiting process from optimizing our business steps that are involved. As I mentioned earlier, I think there is a opportunity for us over time in terms of place of work, with the vast majority of our employees working in high-cost locations within the US. That's something that we can make progress on in '24, as well as beyond. So those are the big levers that I'd point to. Yeah, we saw it was mostly additive. There were some traders that sold out a spot and got to ETF, but that was really more of the exception. And we also offer the ETFs in our retirement accounts, which accounted for some of the pickup as well. So overall, we don't view this as cannibalization. It's additive and we think it's really good for customers as well. Yeah, this is Jason, I'll start and we'll see if that has any additional color. We love the Gold program, Gold members have an ARPU that's multiples of our average ARPU. And you're right, the $5 a month it's just a screaming deal. We want it to be obvious for every customer that they should be a Gold subscriber. So we're paying close attention to the behavior of Gold. They're bringing in more net deposits, they're using more of our products, and they do all that with a relatively modest monthly subscription. We'll evaluate pricing over time. But all in, we just love the economics of the Gold subscription. And I do think over time there is an opportunity for us to take Robinhood Gold internationally. So, we think a fair amount will probably be executed heading up into the election season. I think BestX is an important aspect to that. We participated in the comment process and we feel like a fair number of our comments were incorporated, and that's baked into, really the expectations that we have for 2024. The one thing, Ken, that I'd highlight is that the crypto volume on Robinhood nearly doubled in Q4. So really seeing strong engagement and increasing market share. Thanks, Ken. Yeah, Ben, I'd say in the UK we know that payment for order flow isn't allowed, but really all of the other income streams are available there over time. So margin, fully paid securities lending, certainly interest on cash. And so I would say, as we look internationally, the revenue characteristics and ARPU in some jurisdictions will be a little higher than the US, some a little lower. But on average, we think that the income potential is pretty much on par with what we're seeing in the US. Yeah, and remember that payment for order flow is actually a pretty modest portion of our revenue for equities trading in the US. And so not having that in the UK is not a big concern."

After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Koegel, Vice President of Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations.\nChris Koegel: Thank you, Carmen, and thank you to everyone for joining Robinhood's Q3 Earnings Call. With us today are CEO and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev, and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor, are described in the press release we issued today, the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investors.robinhood.com, our Form 10-Q filed this afternoon and in our other SEC filings. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial metrics. Reconciliations to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks for the intro, Chris, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. It's been nearly 10 years since Baiju, and I first launched the waitlist for Robinhood. Back then, nobody had heard of fintech, customers were paying $7 to $10 every time they placed a trade at one of the discount brokerages and people were generally skeptical about using their smartphones for serious financial matters. Investors were also skeptical about Robinhood\u2019s prospects as a business. They viewed the idea of us entering a highly regulated market with large entrenched competitors as a fool's errand. Even if we were to succeed in bringing our product to market, would anyone want it? The conventional wisdom at the time was that an individual stock investing was dead and that all anyone needed with index funds. We spoke to nearly 100 investors before we closed our initial seed round at a $10 million valuation. Almost 10 years later, we're serving over 23 million customers in the US. Our surviving competitors have been forced to adopt our business model and even to adapt their user interfaces to be similar to ours. And Robinhood is no longer just the trading app, we've been rapidly evolving into a broad financial services platform serving multiple financial needs, including spending, savings, and retirement. Our ambition and the opportunity ahead of us has expanded greatly. And so it still feels like we are at the beginning of our journey. We're still number two in retail trading market share in the US. We're at the very early stages of expanding beyond trading, with just over $1 billion of retirement assets on our platform, out of the over $12 trillion US IRA market. We're also just now beginning to take our first steps to serve customers outside the US, where we believe the need and opportunity for innovation in financial services is even greater than it is domestically. As we continue to execute on our strategy, we believe we can grow into one of the largest and most profitable financial companies in the world. I'm excited to talk to you about our progress. But first, let's review our Q3 high-level business and financial results. It goes without saying that the macro-environment of the past few years has been challenging for investors. Geopolitical tensions are continuing to increase, interest rates are at 30-year highs and household savings are being depleted at a rapid clip. I want to explain the three things I look at a company level to ensure Robinhood emerges from this challenging environment stronger than ever. First, financial health. You've heard we mention over the past year, that I want to ensure Robinhood is a sustainable business, not just in bull markets, but in all market conditions. Put in a lot of work to make this a reality. We had our first quarter of GAAP profitability as a public company in Q2. And in Q3, total net revenues were up 29% from a year ago, and by keeping our costs lean, we more than doubled our adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. This is all while making big investments across product, customer service, and international expansion. Second, company culture. I believe very strongly that small groups of highly motivated and talented people can out-execute incumbents with over 10x the headcount and resources. I believe we have the highest concentration of talent in the history of the company. And over the past year, we've turned the crank even more on ensuring we are hiring, retaining, and motivating the highest caliber people across all of our positions. Third, product velocity. We use a number of metrics to track this and right now by several key metrics, our product velocity is the highest in our recorded history. We move fast and we've been simultaneously improving our service quality. Now let's turn to our 2023 roadmap, which as you know, we've organized into three areas, deepening relationships with our customers, innovating for our active traders and launching new growth opportunities. Let's first talk about how we're deepening relationships with our customers. Success in this part of our strategy means that Robinhood becomes the most important financial relationship for a large portion of our customers. This will lead to a healthier and more diversified business and you should track our progress here by Gold subscribers and net deposits. Robinhood Gold continues to be our number-one focus in deepening relationships with our customers. Over the past year, as the environment evolved and customers were looking for new ways to save and invest, we put a lot more value in Gold by adding a 4.9% APY on uninvested cash and a 3% match on IRA contributions. As a result, subscriptions are now over 1.3 million and growth is accelerating as we added 100,000 in Q3 alone and 240,000 over the past year. Today, 6% of Robinhood customers are Gold subscribers, and new customers are joining Gold at more than double that rate. Gold customers had tens of thousands of dollars in average assets under custody, up more than 60% year-over-year and they've opened IRAs with us at seven times the rate of non-Gold customers. As we look ahead, we want the majority of our customers to be Gold subscribers and we're taking a number of steps to make that a reality. [Ulti] (ph) is one of them right now. After acquiring X1 in July, our team has been hard at work, creating an awesome credit card and we've got something special planned for Gold customers. You'll hear more about this early next year. Now let's discuss active traders. We are laser-focused on being the number one platform for active traders and we track our progress here by market share. Our focus has been on systematically removing any limitation that would lead an active trader to consider using another platform with a particular emphasis on pricing, speed, and app usability. In the past quarter, we streamlined our equity's trading flow, introduced options chain customization and an option P&L simulator, and more than doubled the number of stocks and ETFs available to trade 24/5 on Robinhood 24 Hour Market. For our Crypto customers, we've rolled out some changes to the user interface on mobile, so that customers can clearly see the spreads that we offer on our Crypto transactions. This makes it easier for customers to see their all-in cost of execution compared against other platforms and see how great of a deal Robinhood is giving them. As we deliver for our active traders, we continue to see our market share of retail trading grow. In Q3, both our equities and options market share increased from Q2 and year-over-year. Let me now talk about futures. We're getting closer to unveiling our offering there. And we have been hard at work, building what we believe is the best-designed futures product, particularly on mobile. Competitors generate hundreds of millions of annual revenue from futures trading. So as we continue to execute, we believe we have a real opportunity to expand the market, take market share, and build a nine-figure revenue business over time. The third part of our 2023 roadmap is exploring new growth opportunities. Here, we have been laser-focused on international expansion. In the US alone, we've built a business with 23 million customers that serves nearly 10% of American adults. But there are billions more potential customers across the globe. And as we serve them, we believe our business can evolve into one where the majority of our customer base is outside the US in the years to come. Our approach has been to build the capabilities for international expansion, organically. This allows us to scale in a capital-efficient manner, while easily sharing our capabilities across multiple geos. For example, with the launch of Robinhood 24 Hour Market, we became the first US broker to offer round-the-clock trading of individual stocks. Our customers in the UK will benefit from this and other platform enhancements, as 24 Hour Market will be available in the UK at launch. Two major things are happening in the coming weeks. First, we'll launch brokerage operations in the UK. We look forward to eliminating commissions in that market, just like we did in the US. Also in the coming weeks, we will launch crypto trading in the EU. Crypto benefits from a relatively clear regulatory framework in the EU and we're excited to bring our capabilities across the pond to better serve that market. As I reflect on all that Robinhood has in front of us, I'm energized by our long-term potential to innovate for our customers, grow assets, gain market share, and continue to disrupt our industry. We're really excited about the roadmap ahead and there is so much to do. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. In the third quarter, we stayed focused on serving customers, growing our business, and driving long-term shareholder value. Our team continues to execute on our product roadmap while growing revenues and delivering strong operating leverage in the business. In a very different macro-environment than two years ago, we believe we have a good shot of delivering record annual revenue in 2023. And our adjusted EBITDA this year is on track to be roughly three times our prior record. We're also excited to see momentum continuing to build, with growing market share of retail trading and increased customer adoption of our new products. Taking a look at new products, Robinhood Retirement has over $1 billion of AUC and our new 3% contribution match for Gold members is making us really excited for IRA season. Securities lending enrolled nearly 400,000 customers in Q3, bringing our total to nearly 2 million customers with over $10 billion of balances. Robinhood Gold grew by 100,000 subscribers in Q3 alone, bringing the total to 1.3 million subscribers, roughly double the pace we've seen in the past few quarters, and the biggest increase in over two years. And we're also pleased to see over 10% of withdrawals are done through instant. So we love that our revenue drivers keep moving higher. Let's look at our business results in the third quarter. Net deposits remain strong in what is typically a seasonally slow quarter, they were $4 billion in Q3, which translates to an 18% annual growth rate. And over the past 12 months, they grew at 27%. AUC ended the quarter at $87 billion, up 34% from a year ago. While equity markets were challenging in Q3, we're optimistic that the continued strength of customer net deposits and long-term market appreciation will be a powerful tailwind to our business over time. Now let's turn to our financial results. As a reminder, last quarter we reached GAAP profitability for the first time as a public company, generating $25 million of net income or $0.03 of EPS. This quarter, we recorded a $104 million regulatory accrual for historical matters, as we previously disclosed. This led to Q3 results, moving back to a loss, with net income of negative $85 million or a loss of $0.09 per share. Q3 net income prior to this accrual would have been positive $19 million or $0.02 per share, which would have been similar to last quarter. In Q3, we generated adjusted EBITDA margins of 29%, up 16 points from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $137 million in Q3 and $485 million over the past year, which is nearly a $900 million improvement compared to our first year as a public company. So the natural question is, how do we drive profitability even higher over time? We're focused on two things, first, growing revenues. We want to serve more of our customers' financial needs, become number-one in active trading, and expand internationally. Second, we want to stay lean as we scale. Our cost structure is roughly 90% fixed, which supports high incremental margins in operating leverage. And we will continue to push on our fixed costs wherever we can. So we think we have a good path to higher levels of profitability over time. And we look forward to sharing our progress as we go. Now, let's review Q3 revenues. Total net revenues were $467 million, up 29% from a year ago. Revenues were down 4% from Q2, as growth in net interest revenue was offset by lower transaction revenues and seasonally lower proxy revenues. Transaction-based revenues in Q3 were $185 million, down 4% sequentially, primarily due to lower crypto volumes. Moving to net interest revenues, they were $251 million in Q3, up 7% sequentially. The increase was driven by higher interest-earning assets in short-term interest rates, partially offset by lower securities lending. Looking ahead, we are watching a couple of areas, that so far in Q4 are in the lower part of their cyclical ranges. Specifically, Q4-to-date securities lending activity is well below the third-quarter average. Additionally, Q3 net buying was the highest level we've seen in over a year, which drove free credit balances lower in the third quarter. So far in Q4, net buying has moderated. So free credit balances have increased by a few hundred million dollars. But if the current levels of securities lending and free credit balances continue, we anticipate Q4 net interest revenue will be roughly $20 million lower than Q3 levels. Looking beyond Q4, we have a much more constructive outlook for net interest revenue, as we continue to attract customer cash and net deposits, enroll customers in securities lending, and prepare to grow our credit card business. Moving on to other revenues, they declined sequentially to $31 million in Q3, as seasonally lower proxy revenues were partially offset by growth in Gold subscriptions and Sherwood Media advertising revenue. I also want to share some additional color on what we saw in October. We added another 30,000 funded accounts and customers contributed another $1 billion of net deposits to Robinhood. Additionally, October trading volumes picked up from September. Relative to Q3 monthly averages, October options in crypto were roughly in line and equities were about 10% below. I also wanted to note that we often see lower trading volumes in November and December around the holidays. Looking at expenses, we continue to make significant progress, investing for long-term growth, while driving efficiency by lowering our full-year costs from 2022 levels. Starting with adjusted OpEx, which reflects total operating expenses less SBC and the regulatory accrual, it was $353 million in Q3, below our prior outlook range. This brings our year-to-date total to $1.06 billion or 76% of revenues. As we invest for the long term and scale our business over time, we are focused on leveraging our highly fixed cost base to drive adjusted OpEx lower as a percentage of revenue. Reflecting on our progress year-to-date, we feel good about our expense discipline while continuing to invest for the long term. So in Q4, while we plan to keep driving efficiency across our business, we plan to make some targeted growth investments in marketing and product launches, including for the UK, Futures and Credit Card. We also anticipate some short-term elevated legal expenses related to the historical regulatory matters I mentioned earlier. Given this, we are planning for Q4 adjusted OpEx in the range of $375 million to $395 million, which slightly lowers the midpoint of our full-year outlook and brings our 2023 adjusted OpEx range to $1.435 million to $1.455 billion. This full-year outlook has us on track to save around $75 million from our 2022 level. Turning to share-based compensation, it was $83 million in Q3, below our prior outlook range. SBC as a percentage of revenue was 18% in Q3, down from 30% a year ago. We're managing SBC costs closely. So as we scale our business over the coming years, we're focused on driving a closer to 10% of revenue. Looking ahead to Q4, we're lowering our 2023 SBC outlook again by an additional $50 million. Our updated outlook for full-year 2023 SBC is a range of $860 million to $880 million, which implies a Q4 range of $70 million to $90 million. Just to put that in context, if we look at the mid-point of our Q4 range on an annualized basis, that's about $320 million, which represents an annual savings of over $300 million versus 2022. And looking at dilution, prior to our Q3 share purchase, diluted shares were up 1.2% through the first three quarters, well below our initial full-year outlook of 4% or less. Now let's turn to capital management. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet while deploying capital into opportunities that drive growth and shareholder value. Over the past year, we generated nearly $500 million of adjusted EBITDA. And in Q3, we deployed over 700 million to purchase 55 million shares of our stock and to acquire X1. We still finished the quarter with nearly $5.5 billion of cash and investments. We know we still have a lot of cash on hand, but in this macro backdrop, we like the balance sheet strength and optionality it provides. In closing, I'm excited about the momentum we're building and believe we have a huge opportunity ahead of us. We believe we can deliver new capabilities and enhance customer experience while producing great financial outcomes for our shareholders. With that, Chris, let's move to Q&A.\nA - Chris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Jason. For the Q&A session, we'll start by answering shareholder questions from Say Technologies. These are ranked by number of votes. We'll pass over any questions that we already addressed on this call or in prior quarters. We'll also group together questions that share a common theme. After that, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So I'll kick it off with our first question from say, I\u2019ve put two together here, and these are for Jason. Massey R. asks, your stock price has been floating between $9 and $12 for over two years. What will it take to bring it back to the IPO price? And Fung N. asks, with all these new incentives happening on Robinhood, why has Robinhood not been able to raise its stock price back to the IPO level?\nJason Warnick: Thanks for the questions. So first of all, we hear you. It feels like we've made a ton of progress, and we just haven't seen it translate yet to a higher stock price. On a macro level, interest rates are up, which generally isn't good for stock prices, and it hasn't been good for fintech companies. But we're staying focused on things that are in our control, like growing our business and driving profits higher. Over the long term, we think this is the approach that will move our share price up, and we appreciate your questions.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Jason. The next question is for Vlad. I'm going to put together two here as well. So Brandsey asks, would it be possible to add a dividend information tab? And Jeremy J. asks, we continue to ask for a dividend forecasting management tool, when will that feature come to fruition?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. Thank you. We're always looking for ways to improve our customer experience. So thank you for these questions around dividends. I actually reached out to the team and asked them to make sure this is added to the roadmap. So it will be done.\nChris Koegel: Thanks, Vlad. The next question is from William W., who asks, the biggest thing that seems to be driving your churn to profitability is the high interest rate on your cash pile. What will be the plan to maintain profits when the Fed reduces those rates? Jason?\nJason Warnick: Yeah. So one of the nice things about our business is that it's naturally hedged for changes in interest rates. Trading revenues and interest income tend to move in opposite directions. So we think we're pretty well positioned to perform financially regardless of the rate environment. We've seen this play out over the last few years. In the lower rate environment, trading revenues were strong. But with rates moving higher, trading revenue abated some, but interest income has picked up. So at the same time, we're continuing to invest to grow our business through the cycle. So for higher rate environments, we've launched things like gold high yield as well as fully paid stock lending. And for when higher trading environments come along, it's great to see that our market share is up in equities and options as we continue to invest in our platform. So overall, we feel really good about our position regardless of what interest rates do.\nChris Koegel: Thanks, Jason. The next question is for Vlad and it's from Malcolm D. who asks, what will Robinhood do to grow market share and expand operations?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, happy to answer that. So to start with, our market share has been growing. If we look at equities and options, market share is up year-over-year and also sequentially for the past three quarters in a row. And as we look at opportunities to grow even faster, right now, we can see we're winning in mobile. And we think that's great because clearly, that's the fastest-growing part of our industry. I think the long-term trend will continue to be more and more of the legacy brick-and-mortar based and web activity moving in the direction of mobile. I think it's also important to note that a couple of our key competitors are going through merger-related integrations right now. So we've got TD Ameritrade merging with Schwab and ETRADE through Morgan Stanley and we've seen actually a lot of customers complaining about those integrations being forced to abandon some of the user interfaces that they'd like, not really satisfied with the mobile products that they're being asked to convert to. And we've been seeing really, really healthy and growing inflows from both of those competitors. And actually right now to accelerate that even further, we're running a 1% match on ACATS, not just into retirement accounts but also into taxable accounts. And so we're excited to share even more value with customers through that offer. So doubling down on our leadership in mobile. And also, we're continuing to expand and improve the product experience across the board.\nChris Koegel: Right. Thank you, Vlad. The next question is also for you. Todd Z. asked, what is Robinhood doing to convince long-term investors to stay and grow with Robinhood rather than transfer to other accounts when they reach a higher net worth?\nVlad Tenev: Absolutely. Thank you for that question. This is a key part of our strategy. When I say deepening relationships with customers that really starts with making sure as they grow and as their needs evolve, Robinhood is the platform for them and can serve the wide variety of the financial needs that they have. So our biggest investment in area of focus here is around Robinhood Gold. As you know, Robinhood Gold launched a competitive rate on uninvested cash, which allows customers to take advantage of the high-rate environment we're in and earn a high yield on cash even when they're not investing. So right now, that's 4.9% APY and a nice bonus is you get up to $2.25 million in FDIC insurance protection. So it's actually superior to a traditional savings product that you might find at a bank in the level of protection, not to mention the yield. We recently rolled out an unprecedented 3% retirement match for Gold customers. So basically, with the new IRA contributions limits slated to increase to $7,000, that's an extra over $200 a year in bonus that you could be getting just by fully funding your retirement account, which is a deal that you can't find anywhere else. And so the sort of confluence of this is once you become a Robinhood customer, we're seeing more and more of those customers adopt Gold. Once you're in Gold, you get an industry-leading value and the user experience across a wide plethora of our products. So if you want to retire with us, you can't get a better deal elsewhere. If you want to generate cash, even if you're not investing it -- yield on the cash, we offer that. And we're continuing to add more and more features and value in Gold over time. The upshot of that is Gold balances have been increasing at a very healthy rate. You've seen the progress we've made in Gold subscribers. Our churn and retention, particularly of our most valuable customers continues to improve. And we think we're just getting started. We're hard at work making this better and better. But I do think we're actually seeing our strategy paying off, and you're seeing demonstrated progress in increasing wallet share and actually creating these relationships with customers that are significantly deeper.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. The next question is for Jason from Bradley S. who asks, what can Robinhood do in order to become consistently profitable throughout each quarter?\nJason Warnick: It was great to achieve GAAP profit last quarter. It was our first time as a public company. This quarter, but for the regulatory accrual, we would have seen another quarter of GAAP profits. But looking over the long run, we're going to keep investing for growth. But we think we've got a good opportunity to invest for growth and grow revenues faster than costs, which should deliver nice leverage and profitability for the bottom line over time. We're a tech company, a vast majority, 90% of our costs are fixed costs. And so we think we're well positioned to have high incremental margins as we grow the top line.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Jason. The next question is for Vlad and it\u2019s a two-parter. Massey R. asks, when are you going international? And Thomas B. asks, when will Robinhood come to Europe?\nVlad Tenev: Great questions. The answer to both of those is basically now. So I'm excited to say we're getting really close to launching our brokerage in the UK. We should be live in the coming weeks. I'll actually be there knocking on doors in the UK, maybe not literally, but with the team for the launch. And we also announced earlier in my opening prepared remarks that we will be offering crypto trading across the pond in the EU and that's going to come right on the heels of the UK brokerage launch. So both of these launches are exciting. They expand the addressable market of customers we can serve with our financial products. And they're really the first steps in what we see as a big opportunity for us growing the business internationally.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. That concludes our shareholder questions from Say Technologies. We appreciate our shareholders taking time to ask those questions to Vlad and Jason and look forward to more next quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Carmen to lead Q&A from our analysts.\nOperator: Thank you, Chris. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please proceed.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Great results despite the difficult environment. I have two questions, two quick ones. So maybe, Vlad, can you tell us what makes you gain so much share? I know it's a difficult environment, but you guys are gaining tremendous amount of share. Can you give us some color on what makes Robinhood getting so much share? And then I have a very quick follow-up. Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. Thanks, Dan. So, yeah, talking about our active trader offerings, as I mentioned earlier, our goal is to be the number one platform for active traders and we have been gaining share. You're right that I pointed out year-over-year. And for the last three quarters sequentially, we've seen our market share of options and equity transactions continue to increase. And part of that is just the work that we've been doing systematically to improve the pain points that customers have for the product. And yeah, more recently, you can see we've continued to make improvements in options trading. We added things that customers have been asking us for, like the ability to customize options chains and better picture their P&L. We're looking at the experience for equities trading across the board. And as we sort of used it and dug deeply into it, we noticed that in the past, we'd really optimized it toward more of a novice customer. So there was a lot of explanation for how to place different types of orders and for someone that was more active and more of an active trader, we saw an opportunity to streamline it and reduce a lot of the unnecessary steps in the process. And we've been doing that across the board, not just in the in the trading flows, but across the experience. We're also turning our attention to giving more data to customers to make more informed decisions. And you're going to start to see a lot of our work there rolling out in the coming weeks. And I've got to mention also not just kind of table stakes features. We've got a ways to go to continue to close the gap, but we're leading in pricing obviously, for options, most of our competitors are charging $0.65 per contract for typical trades and the hundreds of contracts that adds up to lots and lots of money that is coming out of their pockets. And our pricing advantage is strong and continuing to drive value for us. And new innovative things that you can't find anywhere else really besides Robinhood, things like Robinhood 24 Hour Market are also continuing to play there. And all of this is adding up to the share gains that you're seeing and active trader NPS across -- and that's Net Promoter Score for those that aren't familiar, across options, equities and crypto seeing significant gains that are just continuing to accrue.\nDan Dolev: Terrific. I do have a quick follow-up. I mean it looks to me like Robinhood could be a great place for traders to benefit from the future Bitcoin ETF. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the opportunity if it exists?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I think that what you're seeing is Bitcoin continuing to become attractive to more and more stakeholders as a mainstream asset for diversification. There has been a long-held thesis that it's a good inflation hedge. And obviously, in a high inflation environment, people are interested in ways to diversify their exposure. Robinhood has been early to offer Bitcoin in its native form. And maybe you heard me mention in the prepared remarks that we've actually made a lot of improvements in the crypto user interface. We're showing customers the spread and they're all in cost of execution. And I think we've talked about, Dan, in the call before, how Robinhood has really, really competitive pricing, but maybe customers aren't aware of that. There's not a lot of transparency around it. So we're looking to solve that problem. We believe we have solved it. And I think that more and more customers will see just how great of a deal they're getting with their ability to diversify their portfolio into crypto currencies. So we want to continue to be a leader there. And I think that -- yeah, we're excited about the progress we've made, and there's a lot more to do.\nDan Dolev: Great. We\u2019re excited as well. Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our it\u2019s coming from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please proceed.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Thanks so much. Hi, Vlad. Hi, Jason. How are you?\nVlad Tenev: Great.\nJason Warnick: Hey, Devin.\nDevin Ryan: So looking forward to international launch, a lot to be excited about there. I just want to think about the opportunity or how you guys think about the opportunity, either near or long term to build your own market-making capabilities to participate in more of the economics? And particularly as you scale the offering, I suspect that could be an opportunity, but I just want to get some thoughts there. And then if that's not something that would make sense, just how you're thinking about the unit economics internationally, appreciating that trading is just going to be one part of the longer-term game plan of making a relationship with customers. Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. And you're referring to international, specifically when you're talking about market making?\nDevin Ryan: Right now, I am, yes.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, look, I think our focus right now, there's obviously lots and lots to do in our business. As you pointed out, there's all the stuff we're doing on the consumer side to win an active trading, there's obviously ways to leverage that infrastructure that we're building to process our customers' trades as a B2B offering and market making is kind of in that category. Where we stand now is we're just laser-focused on consumer. We want to make sure we're the best consumer offering out there particularly internationally where we're kind of new to market. We want to make sure that as many of our resources as possible are pointed towards product market fit of the consumer offering. And there's lots of ways that we can monetize Gold subscription. You've heard that, that product, we have a lot of confidence in, and it's just in the early stages. We think that can be just as powerful, if not more so, in the UK, securities lending and other interest-based revenues. So yeah, we're not really focused on diversifying into B2B or Market Making for the near term. But it's obviously something we're familiar with. Once we start getting to the point where that makes sense as a priority, we'd certainly be open to considering.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Thanks a lot. And then just a follow-up here on X1 and the kind of the credit card strategy. I appreciate the new -- net new interest disclosure around cards. And so I just want to maybe hear a little more about the scaling strategy of excellence business across Robinhood and kind of time line that you guys are thinking? And then also maybe on the other side, whether there's any consideration of growing a little bit slower, just to get some data around customer behavior and also just thinking about potential for credit risk as well. Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I'll be happy to field that. I think we're going to build a great product. We actually just reviewed and approved the final designs for what's going to become the Robinhood credit card last week, so we've been making good progress. The team is super motivated to launch it. And we do anticipate there will be a period of learning. Of course, X1 has had some data from their customer base. But we anticipate once we release this new product, the scale of Robinhood's customer base is much bigger. And so we'll want to make sure that we're rolling it out prudently. But the thing that I'm most excited about is you guys seeing it, customers seeing it. I think we've spent a lot of time getting the user experience and the design just right and I think you're really going to love it.\nDevin Ryan: All right. Terrific. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. It comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nMichael Anagnostakis: Hey, good afternoon. This is Michael Anagnostakis on for Stephen. Maybe just one for Jason here on expense. You had noted that you will continue to be disciplined on the expense front. You highlighted largely fixed expense base. As we think about expense beyond '23, what do you see as a reasonable core expense growth rate to sustain that 20% growth -- organic growth that you consistently delivered recently. Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Yeah. Thanks, Michael. Appreciate the question. We've made a ton of progress on operating costs and running lean and driving for productivity and efficiency across our platform over the last 1.5 years. And I'd say that we're not done. We've got more work to do there to be even more efficient and more lean in the way that we operate. That said, we're going to continue to invest for growth. We see a lot of opportunity ahead of us than behind us in terms of the business, including international. So we're going to place some smart investments in a number of areas. I'm sure you can appreciate this is the time of the year when the teams are huddled doing 2024 planning. So it's a bit early for me to comment specifically on the growth rate we expect to see in OpEx next year. But you should expect that over a longer horizon, our intention is to grow revenue faster than OpEx. And we think that there's -- even while making investments, there's opportunity for us to be lean in the way that we manage our costs.\nMichael Anagnostakis: Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up, I just wanted to touch on crypto, again, here. We've seen some stronger performance in Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, but the volume trends have remained pretty subdued, both industry-wide and at Robinhood, but can you speak to what's driving that divergence there? And what do you think needs to happen for activity to pick back up in crypto? Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I think it's hard for me to speculate on activity predictions and the broader cryptocurrency market. I can tell you what we're focused on. We're focused on using this as an opportunity to build our capabilities, build the platform. You've heard me talk in this call about how we want to make sure customers who are using Robinhood for crypto know that they're getting terrific pricing. And so we've continued to make progress there. We are improving the customer experience and the team is hard at work launching in the EU, which will expand the addressable market of customers that we serve by hundreds of millions. So we're excited about that. We're going to continue to innovate and improve the offering in the space. I think there's lots of promising signs, lots of people are spending time building the industry. We're going to continue to be a leader there.\nJason Warnick: I think the one thing that I'd add is -- I think it would be helpful to continue to get some regulatory clarity in the various markets that we're going to be operating in, and that will allow us to innovate even faster.\nMichael Anagnostakis: Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nChris Koegel: There, Mike?\nOperator: Mike, please check your mute button, please. All right. Please rejoin using the call me feature. One moment for our next question. It comes from the line of John Todaro with Needham. Please proceed.\nJohn Todaro: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Vlad, you mentioned earlier that the EU had a clearer regulatory framework around crypto in the US. Just trying to understand in that context, what kind of products or services that you could tangibly point to there? Would you envision kind of more assets for trading in the EU and the US? Just anything that we can kind of tangibly look to?\nVlad Tenev: I really don't want to get ahead of the launch that's coming in a couple of weeks and tell you what the value props are going to be. But yes, in general, we do expect, given the clarity to be able to offer a different set of assets and capabilities in Europe as in the US.\nJohn Todaro: Okay. Thanks for that. And I guess just quickly if I can add another one on. Taking the other side of that and looking at the US market, you guys recently delisted some of the crypto assets. What would give you comfortability to relist some? Is it some of these ongoing suits maybe with Coinbase that need to get resolved? Any clarity there?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I think that, yes, it's hard to say what specifically we're waiting for to give us comfort. I think that rules -- rule-making court case data, that all helps. And of course, we'll continue to push for regulatory clarity because I think it would be a shame for the innovation that we've been seeing in crypto to be co-opted overseas. I think it's very, very important for the US to remain a leader in every new technology in the industry that we possibly can.\nJohn Todaro: Yep, I agree with that. Thank you. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good evening, and thanks for taking the question. One of the footnotes in the release today talked about ACATS in and out, and you mentioned getting inflows from former Ameritrade and E-Trade customers. I'd love you to compare and contrast where ACATS to Robin Hood are coming from generally and where ACATS going out of the firm are generally going to. And then you mentioned the 1% match. When did that go into effect? And then maybe lastly, what sort of ACAT activity are you seeing from firms that are more traditionally known for active trading? Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we have been seeing elevated ACATS from the firms that are going through integrations. I mean the active trading firms, TD Ameritrade has been very strong with active traders, and we've been seeing really healthy and growing inflows there. The 1% match, as you probably know, that started out being a retirement offering. We've expanded it to ACATS in taxable accounts. And I think that's currently in the process of rolling out and being communicated to customers. So it's pretty new. But what we're seeing there has been really, really good. I think that just gives customers an added incentive, the ones that were already thinking about it and using Robinhood to consolidate their assets here. We've been really happy at the trends there.\nJason Warnick: In terms of the more active trader locations, the ins and outs are actually pretty modest overall. So nothing really to call out there.\nKen Worthington: Okay. And then so are the -- you've got ACATS going out as well? Are they going to the same firms where you're getting assets coming in? Or is it a different sort of set of firms where clients are heading out towards?\nJason Warnick: Yes, it's really pretty broad-based across inflows and outflows and common firm names as you'd expect. One thing we like is that the trends are improving for us as we continue to improve user experience.\nKen Worthington: Great. Thank you very much.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have time for one more question. One moment please. And it's from the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Please proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Chris O'Brien on for Ben. I wanted to ask you about the options takeout. It looks like it came down 4 basis points or so quarter-over-quarter. Is there anything you can share regarding the drivers here as to what's driving the change in the take rate?\nJason Warnick: Yeah. So first of all, the take rate was $0.41 this quarter. There's two primary things that go into the take rate that we realized on option contracts. What I'd point to is volatility and then it's also a mix of contracts, specifically we're seeing increasing mix as we have for some time now of SPY contracts over individual name contracts, and that has been a headwind for us on the take rate.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Very helpful. And I also just wanted to follow up on the international expansion. When we think about the launch of the UK product, like what kind of products will be available on day one? How long of a ramp will it take to kind of fully get capabilities up to something like we might see in the US?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, I'll field that one. So I did mention that equities trading, in particular, 24-hour market will be available at launch. In terms of the other value props, again, would rather not run ahead of the announcement, like we'll find out very soon. The benefits of doing our international expansion organically is we can leverage the same platform. That's why Robinhood 24 Hour Market is available at launch. It's all on the same platform. So there's really no technical limitation to making our services available anywhere that we operate. It's all just a matter of licensure and making sure that we have the appropriate licenses for all the different products we offer. And I think you're really going to start to see the organic strategy paying dividends as we continue to expand across multiple jurisdictions, and we add things here in the US and we add -- we connect to different market centers overseas. You'll see that the value accrue both to our US customers and the customers in new jurisdictions.\nJason Warnick: And Chris, one more follow-up on the options take rate. We've seen that mix continue into October and actually accelerate just a little bit and the take rate moved to $0.39 a contract in October. We'll see how the rest of the quarter plays out, but I thought I would highlight that for you.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Excellent. Thank you. One moment please for one more question. It\u2019s from the line of Michael Cyprys, please proceed from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Thanks for taking the question. Having some technical difficulties with the phone before. It's not sure if you answered this question just around index options. I think you had mentioned previously that was coming in the first half of '24. Just wondering if you had a more specific update there that you could share? And just more broadly on that, I was hoping you could maybe share your thoughts around the opportunity set, how you see that playing out with index options. Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I mean, one of the things that we're focused on, on our path to number on -- being number one in active trader market share is systematically going through all of the product gaps, making sure that if customers want a particular asset that we make that available. This includes index options, things like shorting, multiple account types like joint accounts. There's just a long list of things that we're prioritizing and building. As for index options, in particular, right now, that's slated for about midyear 2024.\nMichael Cyprys: Got it. Okay. And then just a follow-up question, if I could, just on advice. Just curious if you're thinking about the opportunity set there for providing customers with financial advice. How do you think about where there's sort of space in the marketplace? What are the pain points that you might look to address? And how do you think about what the right level of pricing should be?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. Theres -- these are important questions. And what I can tell you is that Robinhood has historically been like a company that values the individual and their autonomy and making decisions and controlling their finances, I think as a self-directed platform, one of the things we pride ourselves in is putting people in the driver seat and in control over their finances. And I think as we think about advisory, we definitely don't want to build another me-too robo that just puts you into a basket of ETFs and does tax loss harvesting and things like that. We think there's a real opportunity to give customers the type of high-end financial advice that if you're the CEO of a company or a high net worth individual, you could get by paying a lot of money, except we want to offer that at a really attractive price point using modern technology and make that available to everyone. So that's kind of the ethos behind the product and we'll definitely share more as we get closer to unveiling that.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A period. I will turn it back to Vladimir Tenev for final remarks.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. Thank you, everyone. Very excited to have you listening to this call. And we're only at the beginning of our journey. So much more to build. So we're going to get back to work. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thanks for the intro, Chris, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. It's been nearly 10 years since Baiju, and I first launched the waitlist for Robinhood. Back then, nobody had heard of fintech, customers were paying $7 to $10 every time they placed a trade at one of the discount brokerages and people were generally skeptical about using their smartphones for serious financial matters. Investors were also skeptical about Robinhood's prospects as a business. They viewed the idea of us entering a highly regulated market with large entrenched competitors as a fool's errand. Even if we were to succeed in bringing our product to market, would anyone want it? The conventional wisdom at the time was that an individual stock investing was dead and that all anyone needed with index funds. We spoke to nearly 100 investors before we closed our initial seed round at a $10 million valuation. Almost 10 years later, we're serving over 23 million customers in the US. Our surviving competitors have been forced to adopt our business model and even to adapt their user interfaces to be similar to ours. And Robinhood is no longer just the trading app, we've been rapidly evolving into a broad financial services platform serving multiple financial needs, including spending, savings, and retirement. Our ambition and the opportunity ahead of us has expanded greatly. And so it still feels like we are at the beginning of our journey. We're still number two in retail trading market share in the US. We're at the very early stages of expanding beyond trading, with just over $1 billion of retirement assets on our platform, out of the over $12 trillion US IRA market. We're also just now beginning to take our first steps to serve customers outside the US, where we believe the need and opportunity for innovation in financial services is even greater than it is domestically. As we continue to execute on our strategy, we believe we can grow into one of the largest and most profitable financial companies in the world. I'm excited to talk to you about our progress. But first, let's review our Q3 high-level business and financial results. It goes without saying that the macro-environment of the past few years has been challenging for investors. Geopolitical tensions are continuing to increase, interest rates are at 30-year highs and household savings are being depleted at a rapid clip. I want to explain the three things I look at a company level to ensure Robinhood emerges from this challenging environment stronger than ever. First, financial health. You've heard we mention over the past year, that I want to ensure Robinhood is a sustainable business, not just in bull markets, but in all market conditions. Put in a lot of work to make this a reality. We had our first quarter of GAAP profitability as a public company in Q2. And in Q3, total net revenues were up 29% from a year ago, and by keeping our costs lean, we more than doubled our adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. This is all while making big investments across product, customer service, and international expansion. Second, company culture. I believe very strongly that small groups of highly motivated and talented people can out-execute incumbents with over 10x the headcount and resources. I believe we have the highest concentration of talent in the history of the company. And over the past year, we've turned the crank even more on ensuring we are hiring, retaining, and motivating the highest caliber people across all of our positions. Third, product velocity. We use a number of metrics to track this and right now by several key metrics, our product velocity is the highest in our recorded history. We move fast and we've been simultaneously improving our service quality. Now let's turn to our 2023 roadmap, which as you know, we've organized into three areas, deepening relationships with our customers, innovating for our active traders and launching new growth opportunities. Let's first talk about how we're deepening relationships with our customers. Success in this part of our strategy means that Robinhood becomes the most important financial relationship for a large portion of our customers. This will lead to a healthier and more diversified business and you should track our progress here by Gold subscribers and net deposits. Robinhood Gold continues to be our number-one focus in deepening relationships with our customers. Over the past year, as the environment evolved and customers were looking for new ways to save and invest, we put a lot more value in Gold by adding a 4.9% APY on uninvested cash and a 3% match on IRA contributions. As a result, subscriptions are now over 1.3 million and growth is accelerating as we added 100,000 in Q3 alone and 240,000 over the past year. Today, 6% of Robinhood customers are Gold subscribers, and new customers are joining Gold at more than double that rate. Gold customers had tens of thousands of dollars in average assets under custody, up more than 60% year-over-year and they've opened IRAs with us at seven times the rate of non-Gold customers. As we look ahead, we want the majority of our customers to be Gold subscribers and we're taking a number of steps to make that a reality. [Ulti] (ph) is one of them right now. After acquiring X1 in July, our team has been hard at work, creating an awesome credit card and we've got something special planned for Gold customers. You'll hear more about this early next year. Now let's discuss active traders. We are laser-focused on being the number one platform for active traders and we track our progress here by market share. Our focus has been on systematically removing any limitation that would lead an active trader to consider using another platform with a particular emphasis on pricing, speed, and app usability. In the past quarter, we streamlined our equity's trading flow, introduced options chain customization and an option P&L simulator, and more than doubled the number of stocks and ETFs available to trade 24/5 on Robinhood 24 Hour Market. For our Crypto customers, we've rolled out some changes to the user interface on mobile, so that customers can clearly see the spreads that we offer on our Crypto transactions. This makes it easier for customers to see their all-in cost of execution compared against other platforms and see how great of a deal Robinhood is giving them. As we deliver for our active traders, we continue to see our market share of retail trading grow. In Q3, both our equities and options market share increased from Q2 and year-over-year. Let me now talk about futures. We're getting closer to unveiling our offering there. And we have been hard at work, building what we believe is the best-designed futures product, particularly on mobile. Competitors generate hundreds of millions of annual revenue from futures trading. So as we continue to execute, we believe we have a real opportunity to expand the market, take market share, and build a nine-figure revenue business over time. The third part of our 2023 roadmap is exploring new growth opportunities. Here, we have been laser-focused on international expansion. In the US alone, we've built a business with 23 million customers that serves nearly 10% of American adults. But there are billions more potential customers across the globe. And as we serve them, we believe our business can evolve into one where the majority of our customer base is outside the US in the years to come. Our approach has been to build the capabilities for international expansion, organically. This allows us to scale in a capital-efficient manner, while easily sharing our capabilities across multiple geos. For example, with the launch of Robinhood 24 Hour Market, we became the first US broker to offer round-the-clock trading of individual stocks. Our customers in the UK will benefit from this and other platform enhancements, as 24 Hour Market will be available in the UK at launch. Two major things are happening in the coming weeks. First, we'll launch brokerage operations in the UK. We look forward to eliminating commissions in that market, just like we did in the US. Also in the coming weeks, we will launch crypto trading in the EU. Crypto benefits from a relatively clear regulatory framework in the EU and we're excited to bring our capabilities across the pond to better serve that market. As I reflect on all that Robinhood has in front of us, I'm energized by our long-term potential to innovate for our customers, grow assets, gain market share, and continue to disrupt our industry. We're really excited about the roadmap ahead and there is so much to do. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jason. Yeah. Thank you. We're always looking for ways to improve our customer experience. So thank you for these questions around dividends. I actually reached out to the team and asked them to make sure this is added to the roadmap. So it will be done. Yeah, happy to answer that. So to start with, our market share has been growing. If we look at equities and options, market share is up year-over-year and also sequentially for the past three quarters in a row. And as we look at opportunities to grow even faster, right now, we can see we're winning in mobile. And we think that's great because clearly, that's the fastest-growing part of our industry. I think the long-term trend will continue to be more and more of the legacy brick-and-mortar based and web activity moving in the direction of mobile. I think it's also important to note that a couple of our key competitors are going through merger-related integrations right now. So we've got TD Ameritrade merging with Schwab and ETRADE through Morgan Stanley and we've seen actually a lot of customers complaining about those integrations being forced to abandon some of the user interfaces that they'd like, not really satisfied with the mobile products that they're being asked to convert to. And we've been seeing really, really healthy and growing inflows from both of those competitors. And actually right now to accelerate that even further, we're running a 1% match on ACATS, not just into retirement accounts but also into taxable accounts. And so we're excited to share even more value with customers through that offer. So doubling down on our leadership in mobile. And also, we're continuing to expand and improve the product experience across the board. Absolutely. Thank you for that question. This is a key part of our strategy. When I say deepening relationships with customers that really starts with making sure as they grow and as their needs evolve, Robinhood is the platform for them and can serve the wide variety of the financial needs that they have. So our biggest investment in area of focus here is around Robinhood Gold. As you know, Robinhood Gold launched a competitive rate on uninvested cash, which allows customers to take advantage of the high-rate environment we're in and earn a high yield on cash even when they're not investing. So right now, that's 4.9% APY and a nice bonus is you get up to $2.25 million in FDIC insurance protection. So it's actually superior to a traditional savings product that you might find at a bank in the level of protection, not to mention the yield. We recently rolled out an unprecedented 3% retirement match for Gold customers. So basically, with the new IRA contributions limits slated to increase to $7,000, that's an extra over $200 a year in bonus that you could be getting just by fully funding your retirement account, which is a deal that you can't find anywhere else. And so the sort of confluence of this is once you become a Robinhood customer, we're seeing more and more of those customers adopt Gold. Once you're in Gold, you get an industry-leading value and the user experience across a wide plethora of our products. So if you want to retire with us, you can't get a better deal elsewhere. If you want to generate cash, even if you're not investing it -- yield on the cash, we offer that. And we're continuing to add more and more features and value in Gold over time. The upshot of that is Gold balances have been increasing at a very healthy rate. You've seen the progress we've made in Gold subscribers. Our churn and retention, particularly of our most valuable customers continues to improve. And we think we're just getting started. We're hard at work making this better and better. But I do think we're actually seeing our strategy paying off, and you're seeing demonstrated progress in increasing wallet share and actually creating these relationships with customers that are significantly deeper. Great questions. The answer to both of those is basically now. So I'm excited to say we're getting really close to launching our brokerage in the UK. We should be live in the coming weeks. I'll actually be there knocking on doors in the UK, maybe not literally, but with the team for the launch. And we also announced earlier in my opening prepared remarks that we will be offering crypto trading across the pond in the EU and that's going to come right on the heels of the UK brokerage launch. So both of these launches are exciting. They expand the addressable market of customers we can serve with our financial products. And they're really the first steps in what we see as a big opportunity for us growing the business internationally. Yeah. Thanks, Dan. So, yeah, talking about our active trader offerings, as I mentioned earlier, our goal is to be the number one platform for active traders and we have been gaining share. You're right that I pointed out year-over-year. And for the last three quarters sequentially, we've seen our market share of options and equity transactions continue to increase. And part of that is just the work that we've been doing systematically to improve the pain points that customers have for the product. And yeah, more recently, you can see we've continued to make improvements in options trading. We added things that customers have been asking us for, like the ability to customize options chains and better picture their P&L. We're looking at the experience for equities trading across the board. And as we sort of used it and dug deeply into it, we noticed that in the past, we'd really optimized it toward more of a novice customer. So there was a lot of explanation for how to place different types of orders and for someone that was more active and more of an active trader, we saw an opportunity to streamline it and reduce a lot of the unnecessary steps in the process. And we've been doing that across the board, not just in the in the trading flows, but across the experience. We're also turning our attention to giving more data to customers to make more informed decisions. And you're going to start to see a lot of our work there rolling out in the coming weeks. And I've got to mention also not just kind of table stakes features. We've got a ways to go to continue to close the gap, but we're leading in pricing obviously, for options, most of our competitors are charging $0.65 per contract for typical trades and the hundreds of contracts that adds up to lots and lots of money that is coming out of their pockets. And our pricing advantage is strong and continuing to drive value for us. And new innovative things that you can't find anywhere else really besides Robinhood, things like Robinhood 24 Hour Market are also continuing to play there. And all of this is adding up to the share gains that you're seeing and active trader NPS across -- and that's Net Promoter Score for those that aren't familiar, across options, equities and crypto seeing significant gains that are just continuing to accrue. Yeah. I think that what you're seeing is Bitcoin continuing to become attractive to more and more stakeholders as a mainstream asset for diversification. There has been a long-held thesis that it's a good inflation hedge. And obviously, in a high inflation environment, people are interested in ways to diversify their exposure. Robinhood has been early to offer Bitcoin in its native form. And maybe you heard me mention in the prepared remarks that we've actually made a lot of improvements in the crypto user interface. We're showing customers the spread and they're all in cost of execution. And I think we've talked about, Dan, in the call before, how Robinhood has really, really competitive pricing, but maybe customers aren't aware of that. There's not a lot of transparency around it. So we're looking to solve that problem. We believe we have solved it. And I think that more and more customers will see just how great of a deal they're getting with their ability to diversify their portfolio into crypto currencies. So we want to continue to be a leader there. And I think that -- yeah, we're excited about the progress we've made, and there's a lot more to do. Thanks, Dan. Great. Yeah. And you're referring to international, specifically when you're talking about market making? Yeah, look, I think our focus right now, there's obviously lots and lots to do in our business. As you pointed out, there's all the stuff we're doing on the consumer side to win an active trading, there's obviously ways to leverage that infrastructure that we're building to process our customers' trades as a B2B offering and market making is kind of in that category. Where we stand now is we're just laser-focused on consumer. We want to make sure we're the best consumer offering out there particularly internationally where we're kind of new to market. We want to make sure that as many of our resources as possible are pointed towards product market fit of the consumer offering. And there's lots of ways that we can monetize Gold subscription. You've heard that, that product, we have a lot of confidence in, and it's just in the early stages. We think that can be just as powerful, if not more so, in the UK, securities lending and other interest-based revenues. So yeah, we're not really focused on diversifying into B2B or Market Making for the near term. But it's obviously something we're familiar with. Once we start getting to the point where that makes sense as a priority, we'd certainly be open to considering. Yeah. I'll be happy to field that. I think we're going to build a great product. We actually just reviewed and approved the final designs for what's going to become the Robinhood credit card last week, so we've been making good progress. The team is super motivated to launch it. And we do anticipate there will be a period of learning. Of course, X1 has had some data from their customer base. But we anticipate once we release this new product, the scale of Robinhood's customer base is much bigger. And so we'll want to make sure that we're rolling it out prudently. But the thing that I'm most excited about is you guys seeing it, customers seeing it. I think we've spent a lot of time getting the user experience and the design just right and I think you're really going to love it. Thank you. Yeah. I think it's hard for me to speculate on activity predictions and the broader cryptocurrency market. I can tell you what we're focused on. We're focused on using this as an opportunity to build our capabilities, build the platform. You've heard me talk in this call about how we want to make sure customers who are using Robinhood for crypto know that they're getting terrific pricing. And so we've continued to make progress there. We are improving the customer experience and the team is hard at work launching in the EU, which will expand the addressable market of customers that we serve by hundreds of millions. So we're excited about that. We're going to continue to innovate and improve the offering in the space. I think there's lots of promising signs, lots of people are spending time building the industry. We're going to continue to be a leader there. I really don't want to get ahead of the launch that's coming in a couple of weeks and tell you what the value props are going to be. But yes, in general, we do expect, given the clarity to be able to offer a different set of assets and capabilities in Europe as in the US. Yeah. I think that, yes, it's hard to say what specifically we're waiting for to give us comfort. I think that rules -- rule-making court case data, that all helps. And of course, we'll continue to push for regulatory clarity because I think it would be a shame for the innovation that we've been seeing in crypto to be co-opted overseas. I think it's very, very important for the US to remain a leader in every new technology in the industry that we possibly can. Yes. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we have been seeing elevated ACATS from the firms that are going through integrations. I mean the active trading firms, TD Ameritrade has been very strong with active traders, and we've been seeing really healthy and growing inflows there. The 1% match, as you probably know, that started out being a retirement offering. We've expanded it to ACATS in taxable accounts. And I think that's currently in the process of rolling out and being communicated to customers. So it's pretty new. But what we're seeing there has been really, really good. I think that just gives customers an added incentive, the ones that were already thinking about it and using Robinhood to consolidate their assets here. We've been really happy at the trends there. Yeah, I'll field that one. So I did mention that equities trading, in particular, 24-hour market will be available at launch. In terms of the other value props, again, would rather not run ahead of the announcement, like we'll find out very soon. The benefits of doing our international expansion organically is we can leverage the same platform. That's why Robinhood 24 Hour Market is available at launch. It's all on the same platform. So there's really no technical limitation to making our services available anywhere that we operate. It's all just a matter of licensure and making sure that we have the appropriate licenses for all the different products we offer. And I think you're really going to start to see the organic strategy paying dividends as we continue to expand across multiple jurisdictions, and we add things here in the US and we add -- we connect to different market centers overseas. You'll see that the value accrue both to our US customers and the customers in new jurisdictions. Yeah. I mean, one of the things that we're focused on, on our path to number on -- being number one in active trader market share is systematically going through all of the product gaps, making sure that if customers want a particular asset that we make that available. This includes index options, things like shorting, multiple account types like joint accounts. There's just a long list of things that we're prioritizing and building. As for index options, in particular, right now, that's slated for about midyear 2024. Yeah. Theres -- these are important questions. And what I can tell you is that Robinhood has historically been like a company that values the individual and their autonomy and making decisions and controlling their finances, I think as a self-directed platform, one of the things we pride ourselves in is putting people in the driver seat and in control over their finances. And I think as we think about advisory, we definitely don't want to build another me-too robo that just puts you into a basket of ETFs and does tax loss harvesting and things like that. We think there's a real opportunity to give customers the type of high-end financial advice that if you're the CEO of a company or a high net worth individual, you could get by paying a lot of money, except we want to offer that at a really attractive price point using modern technology and make that available to everyone. So that's kind of the ethos behind the product and we'll definitely share more as we get closer to unveiling that. Yeah. Thank you, everyone. Very excited to have you listening to this call. And we're only at the beginning of our journey. So much more to build. So we're going to get back to work. Thank you."

            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. In the third quarter, we stayed focused on serving customers, growing our business, and driving long-term shareholder value. Our team continues to execute on our product roadmap while growing revenues and delivering strong operating leverage in the business. In a very different macro-environment than two years ago, we believe we have a good shot of delivering record annual revenue in 2023. And our adjusted EBITDA this year is on track to be roughly three times our prior record. We're also excited to see momentum continuing to build, with growing market share of retail trading and increased customer adoption of our new products. Taking a look at new products, Robinhood Retirement has over $1 billion of AUC and our new 3% contribution match for Gold members is making us really excited for IRA season. Securities lending enrolled nearly 400,000 customers in Q3, bringing our total to nearly 2 million customers with over $10 billion of balances. Robinhood Gold grew by 100,000 subscribers in Q3 alone, bringing the total to 1.3 million subscribers, roughly double the pace we've seen in the past few quarters, and the biggest increase in over two years. And we're also pleased to see over 10% of withdrawals are done through instant. So we love that our revenue drivers keep moving higher. Let's look at our business results in the third quarter. Net deposits remain strong in what is typically a seasonally slow quarter, they were $4 billion in Q3, which translates to an 18% annual growth rate. And over the past 12 months, they grew at 27%. AUC ended the quarter at $87 billion, up 34% from a year ago. While equity markets were challenging in Q3, we're optimistic that the continued strength of customer net deposits and long-term market appreciation will be a powerful tailwind to our business over time. Now let's turn to our financial results. As a reminder, last quarter we reached GAAP profitability for the first time as a public company, generating $25 million of net income or $0.03 of EPS. This quarter, we recorded a $104 million regulatory accrual for historical matters, as we previously disclosed. This led to Q3 results, moving back to a loss, with net income of negative $85 million or a loss of $0.09 per share. Q3 net income prior to this accrual would have been positive $19 million or $0.02 per share, which would have been similar to last quarter. In Q3, we generated adjusted EBITDA margins of 29%, up 16 points from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $137 million in Q3 and $485 million over the past year, which is nearly a $900 million improvement compared to our first year as a public company. So the natural question is, how do we drive profitability even higher over time? We're focused on two things, first, growing revenues. We want to serve more of our customers' financial needs, become number-one in active trading, and expand internationally. Second, we want to stay lean as we scale. Our cost structure is roughly 90% fixed, which supports high incremental margins in operating leverage. And we will continue to push on our fixed costs wherever we can. So we think we have a good path to higher levels of profitability over time. And we look forward to sharing our progress as we go. Now, let's review Q3 revenues. Total net revenues were $467 million, up 29% from a year ago. Revenues were down 4% from Q2, as growth in net interest revenue was offset by lower transaction revenues and seasonally lower proxy revenues. Transaction-based revenues in Q3 were $185 million, down 4% sequentially, primarily due to lower crypto volumes. Moving to net interest revenues, they were $251 million in Q3, up 7% sequentially. The increase was driven by higher interest-earning assets in short-term interest rates, partially offset by lower securities lending. Looking ahead, we are watching a couple of areas, that so far in Q4 are in the lower part of their cyclical ranges. Specifically, Q4-to-date securities lending activity is well below the third-quarter average. Additionally, Q3 net buying was the highest level we've seen in over a year, which drove free credit balances lower in the third quarter. So far in Q4, net buying has moderated. So free credit balances have increased by a few hundred million dollars. But if the current levels of securities lending and free credit balances continue, we anticipate Q4 net interest revenue will be roughly $20 million lower than Q3 levels. Looking beyond Q4, we have a much more constructive outlook for net interest revenue, as we continue to attract customer cash and net deposits, enroll customers in securities lending, and prepare to grow our credit card business. Moving on to other revenues, they declined sequentially to $31 million in Q3, as seasonally lower proxy revenues were partially offset by growth in Gold subscriptions and Sherwood Media advertising revenue. I also want to share some additional color on what we saw in October. We added another 30,000 funded accounts and customers contributed another $1 billion of net deposits to Robinhood. Additionally, October trading volumes picked up from September. Relative to Q3 monthly averages, October options in crypto were roughly in line and equities were about 10% below. I also wanted to note that we often see lower trading volumes in November and December around the holidays. Looking at expenses, we continue to make significant progress, investing for long-term growth, while driving efficiency by lowering our full-year costs from 2022 levels. Starting with adjusted OpEx, which reflects total operating expenses less SBC and the regulatory accrual, it was $353 million in Q3, below our prior outlook range. This brings our year-to-date total to $1.06 billion or 76% of revenues. As we invest for the long term and scale our business over time, we are focused on leveraging our highly fixed cost base to drive adjusted OpEx lower as a percentage of revenue. Reflecting on our progress year-to-date, we feel good about our expense discipline while continuing to invest for the long term. So in Q4, while we plan to keep driving efficiency across our business, we plan to make some targeted growth investments in marketing and product launches, including for the UK, Futures and Credit Card. We also anticipate some short-term elevated legal expenses related to the historical regulatory matters I mentioned earlier. Given this, we are planning for Q4 adjusted OpEx in the range of $375 million to $395 million, which slightly lowers the midpoint of our full-year outlook and brings our 2023 adjusted OpEx range to $1.435 million to $1.455 billion. This full-year outlook has us on track to save around $75 million from our 2022 level. Turning to share-based compensation, it was $83 million in Q3, below our prior outlook range. SBC as a percentage of revenue was 18% in Q3, down from 30% a year ago. We're managing SBC costs closely. So as we scale our business over the coming years, we're focused on driving a closer to 10% of revenue. Looking ahead to Q4, we're lowering our 2023 SBC outlook again by an additional $50 million. Our updated outlook for full-year 2023 SBC is a range of $860 million to $880 million, which implies a Q4 range of $70 million to $90 million. Just to put that in context, if we look at the mid-point of our Q4 range on an annualized basis, that's about $320 million, which represents an annual savings of over $300 million versus 2022. And looking at dilution, prior to our Q3 share purchase, diluted shares were up 1.2% through the first three quarters, well below our initial full-year outlook of 4% or less. Now let's turn to capital management. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet while deploying capital into opportunities that drive growth and shareholder value. Over the past year, we generated nearly $500 million of adjusted EBITDA. And in Q3, we deployed over 700 million to purchase 55 million shares of our stock and to acquire X1. We still finished the quarter with nearly $5.5 billion of cash and investments. We know we still have a lot of cash on hand, but in this macro backdrop, we like the balance sheet strength and optionality it provides. In closing, I'm excited about the momentum we're building and believe we have a huge opportunity ahead of us. We believe we can deliver new capabilities and enhance customer experience while producing great financial outcomes for our shareholders. With that, Chris, let's move to Q&A. Thanks for the questions. So first of all, we hear you. It feels like we've made a ton of progress, and we just haven't seen it translate yet to a higher stock price. On a macro level, interest rates are up, which generally isn't good for stock prices, and it hasn't been good for fintech companies. But we're staying focused on things that are in our control, like growing our business and driving profits higher. Over the long term, we think this is the approach that will move our share price up, and we appreciate your questions. Yeah. So one of the nice things about our business is that it's naturally hedged for changes in interest rates. Trading revenues and interest income tend to move in opposite directions. So we think we're pretty well positioned to perform financially regardless of the rate environment. We've seen this play out over the last few years. In the lower rate environment, trading revenues were strong. But with rates moving higher, trading revenue abated some, but interest income has picked up. So at the same time, we're continuing to invest to grow our business through the cycle. So for higher rate environments, we've launched things like gold high yield as well as fully paid stock lending. And for when higher trading environments come along, it's great to see that our market share is up in equities and options as we continue to invest in our platform. So overall, we feel really good about our position regardless of what interest rates do. It was great to achieve GAAP profit last quarter. It was our first time as a public company. This quarter, but for the regulatory accrual, we would have seen another quarter of GAAP profits. But looking over the long run, we're going to keep investing for growth. But we think we've got a good opportunity to invest for growth and grow revenues faster than costs, which should deliver nice leverage and profitability for the bottom line over time. We're a tech company, a vast majority, 90% of our costs are fixed costs. And so we think we're well positioned to have high incremental margins as we grow the top line. Hey, Devin. Yeah. Thanks, Michael. Appreciate the question. We've made a ton of progress on operating costs and running lean and driving for productivity and efficiency across our platform over the last 1.5 years. And I'd say that we're not done. We've got more work to do there to be even more efficient and more lean in the way that we operate. That said, we're going to continue to invest for growth. We see a lot of opportunity ahead of us than behind us in terms of the business, including international. So we're going to place some smart investments in a number of areas. I'm sure you can appreciate this is the time of the year when the teams are huddled doing 2024 planning. So it's a bit early for me to comment specifically on the growth rate we expect to see in OpEx next year. But you should expect that over a longer horizon, our intention is to grow revenue faster than OpEx. And we think that there's -- even while making investments, there's opportunity for us to be lean in the way that we manage our costs. I think the one thing that I'd add is -- I think it would be helpful to continue to get some regulatory clarity in the various markets that we're going to be operating in, and that will allow us to innovate even faster. In terms of the more active trader locations, the ins and outs are actually pretty modest overall. So nothing really to call out there. Yes, it's really pretty broad-based across inflows and outflows and common firm names as you'd expect. One thing we like is that the trends are improving for us as we continue to improve user experience. Thanks, Ken. Yeah. So first of all, the take rate was $0.41 this quarter. There's two primary things that go into the take rate that we realized on option contracts. What I'd point to is volatility and then it's also a mix of contracts, specifically we're seeing increasing mix as we have for some time now of SPY contracts over individual name contracts, and that has been a headwind for us on the take rate. And Chris, one more follow-up on the options take rate. We've seen that mix continue into October and actually accelerate just a little bit and the take rate moved to $0.39 a contract in October. We'll see how the rest of the quarter plays out, but I thought I would highlight that for you."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Koegel, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Koegel: Thank you, Gigi. And thank you to everyone for joining Robinhood's Q2 earnings call. With us today are CEO and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev, and CFO, Jason Warnick.  Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor, are described in the press release we issued today, the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investors.robinhood.com, our Form 10-Q filed May 10, 2023 and in our other SEC filings. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks for the intro, Chris. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. Last week was the two year anniversary of our IPO and I'm excited to announce an important milestone today. In Q2, we reached GAAP profitability for the first time as a public company. I'm incredibly proud of our team for the resourcefulness and tenacity it took to ship innovative products, serve customers and manage expenses to reach this level.  Let me tell you more about our progress in Q2 starting with our business results. Customer assets under custody grew to $89 billion in Q2, up 13% from Q1, driven by higher equity valuations and continued net deposits. In July, customer assets continued to grow by several billion to over $90 billion. Looking at net deposits, we had over $4 billion in Q2, translating to a 21% annualized growth rate. This brings the total over the past year to over $16 billion as customers continue to trust Robinhood with billions of their investment dollars.  Looking at our financial results, in Q2, we grew total net revenues to $486 million, up 10% from Q1. And by keeping our costs lean, we drove nice operating leverage in our business with adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to a new high of 31%. These results contributed to GAAP net income of $25 million and EPS of positive $0.03.  I'd also highlight that two new products I mentioned last quarter, stock lending and instant withdrawals, continue to accelerate. Each had Q2 revenues that grew another 20% above their Q1 levels. The combined annualized Q2 revenue of these two products is over $90 million, which is roughly the size of our equity trading business. This is exciting progress, and I'm incredibly proud of how well our team is executing.  Now, let's turn to our 2023 roadmap, which, as you know, we've organized into three areas, deepening relationships with our customers, innovating for our active traders, and launching new growth opportunities.  Let's first talk about how we're deepening relationships with our more than 23 million existing customers. Our goal is to serve the entirety of our customers' financial needs. We started with trading and investing and, more recently, we launched spending, saving and retirement products.  We track our progress here by looking at net deposits and ARPU. In Q2, net deposits grew at a 21% annualized growth rate and ARPU increased to $84, the highest level in the past two years. We're also making great progress growing assets per customer. Over the past year, AUC per customer increased 37% on average and 88% for Gold customers.  One focus has been helping customers save and invest their long term money. As a reminder, in January, we launched Robinhood Retirement, the first IRA with a 1% match, no employer necessary, and it's great to see that IRA assets are now close to $1 billion. We believe retirement can grow into a much larger part of our business, especially as we add additional products like Advisory.  Last quarter, I mentioned that we're really happy with the progress we've made with Robinhood Gold and that we're going to be adding even more features and value to the offering. To that end, we are introducing a 3% IRA match for Gold customers, 3 times our standard 1% match. We believe this offer makes Gold incredibly compelling for retirement customers that aren't already Gold subscribers, and will also help us grow retirement business.  Gold cash sweep, which offers customers up to $2 million in FDIC insurance and among the most competitive yields on cash, is also continuing to grow. Gold cash sweep balances grew nearly 40% in Q2 and 130% year-to-date to reach $11 billion. Last week, we increased the interest rate to 4.9%.  As we've attracted and engaged more Gold customers, we've seen them deposit more into their Robinhood accounts. And this continues to drive strong ARPU and revenue growth from our Gold customers. With our competitive 4.9% rate on cash and the new 3% IRA match, we're starting to spin this flywheel even faster.  Now, let me talk a bit about the X1 acquisition. We view credit as a strategic opportunity to both help customers and diversify our business. Many of our 23 million customers are credit card primary. And we also see an opportunity to go down market and help younger people build credit. Right now, for example, if you're an immigrant or a student, it's hard to get credit even if you have the salary and earnings potential to support it. This is one of the problems we're excited to solve. And by doing so, we believe we will grow our customer base, diversify our revenues, further deepen our relationship with our customers.  After exploring the credit space for several years, with X1, we finally found a team that has the right values and DNA to build and scale a category defining consumer credit business. X1 provides their 80,000 card holders with an awesome stainless steel card, attractive customer rewards and a sleek and user friendly mobile platform. The team is working hard to ship a great new Robinhood card that we're excited to offer to our 23 million customers, and we'll expand from there.  Now let's discuss active traders. As you know, over the past year, we continue to aggressively ship products and features to make Robinhood the best destination for active traders. These include advanced charts, cash accounts, strategy builder, stock screeners and, most recently, Robinhood 24 Hour Market.  With 24 hour market, we are the first US retail brokerage to offer 24/5 trading of single name stocks. We finished the rollout to 100% of our customers in July and we love the early uptake we see. We've seen strong volumes in our extended hours offering, particularly during earnings season, and Robinhood 24 Hour Market makes it even easier for customers to trade whenever they want. We're excited to continue to expand the selection of names we offer, and we will be adding nine more tickets quite soon, bringing our total to 52.  As we continue to enhance the experience for active traders, we're seeing our market share of retail trading grow. Last quarter, I mentioned that we were happy with the trajectory that our options trading product was on. We were starting to turn more of our attention to our core equities business.  In addition to 24 hour market, we shipped several tools and enhancements for our active equities traders, including longer chart history, returns comparison tools, and our awesome new screeners and scanners. And just a few hours ago, we rolled out instant deposits and cash accounts to all users.  Customers love these improvements, and we're seeing that in our market share. In Q2, equity market share was up 15% from a year ago, and our options market share was up over 20% from a year ago. So far in Q3, our market share continues to move higher in both equities and options. And we're working on many more improvements that we can't wait to share with customers.  Turning to crypto, we continue to innovate and grow market share while staying mindful of applicable regulations. Our goal is to be the safest, most trusted place for customers to hold, trade and transact with their crypto. We see our recent launches of Robinhood Wallet and Robinhood Connect resonating with customers and we look forward to continuing to invest in crypto.  The third part of our 2023 roadmap is exploring new growth opportunities to broaden the scope and geographical reach of our products, so we can add more customers and increase our revenues over time. We remain focused on our ambitious goal of launching brokerage operations in the UK around the end of year. As you know, we have an existing license in place, a brand that resonates and experienced leaders like JB MacKenzie running the effort. We've been spending a lot of time with customers and are starting to hire key positions on the ground, including bringing on Jordan Sinclair to lead Robinhood UK. We're getting even more excited to drive innovation in the UK market, like we've done in the US.  Another business we recently launched is Sherwood Media, a new media company that is focused on providing the best financial content covering the markets, economics, business, technology and the culture of money.  Our goal is to build on the success of Robinhood Snacks, which is one of the largest financial newsletters in the US with over 10 million weekly readers. We've already started signing multiyear advertising partnerships with NASDAQ, CBOE and other partners.  We're excited about our progress across multiple geographies and business lines. We believe these investments will enable us to serve more customers, while also growing and diversifying our revenues.  As I reflect on all that Robinhood has accomplished so far in our history, I'm energized by our even larger potential over the next decade. We're really excited about the roadmap ahead of us and there's so much to do. We see a huge opportunity to innovate for our customers, grow assets, gain market share, and change the industry for the better, as we democratize finance for all our 23 million customers and many more to come.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. After growing revenue for five straight quarters and getting lean on costs, in Q2, we reached GAAP profitability for the first time as a public company. I'm incredibly proud of our team for all of their progress over the past year, transforming the financial profile of our business and positioning us to drive long term shareholder value.  While we're excited about reaching this milestone, we're just getting started on the journey to drive higher levels of GAAP EPS over time. We remain focused on investing for growth to add new revenue streams, like securities lending and instant withdrawals, as well as gain market share in our existing businesses.  At the same time, we're working to get leaner in ways that don't detract from our growth. For example, in Q2, we made some targeted reductions across a few teams, where we saw increased productivity and opportunities for greater efficiency. We're confident that our growth and efficiency efforts can drive great outcomes for customers and shareholders over time.  Let's now look at how our business grew in the second quarter as we make progress on our mission. We measure our progress in terms of assets under custody and net funded accounts.  Our customers' assets under custody increased 13% sequentially in Q2 to $89 billion, primarily due to higher equity valuations and customers continuing to deposit money into Robinhood.  Looking at net deposits, they were $4.1 billion in Q2, which translates to a 21% annualized growth rate relative to Q1 AUC. We believe these resilient customer net deposits position us really well for continued asset growth, as markets rise over time.  Turning to net funded accounts, which represent unique customers on our platform, they increased to 23.2 million in Q2, up 70,000 from last quarter and 310,000 from a year ago. Additionally, we are excited about the growth we are seeing in our retirement product, which we launched in January. We now have over 325,000 funded retirement accounts, up 75,000 from last quarter, and Gold subscribers increased for the third quarter in a row to over 1.2 million, up about 60,000 sequentially and 150,000 since we launched the Gold yield high yield offering.  Looking at our financial results, we generated positive GAAP net income of $25 million in Q2 and EPS was $0.03. When we look at our $0.37 increase from a year ago, it's great to see the broad improvement across revenue, OpEx and SBC that led to the Q2 result.  In addition, we have continued to derive profitability higher on an adjusted EBITDA basis. It grew to a new high of $151 million in the quarter and our adjusted EBITDA margin also reached a new high of 31%. We are excited about the progress we've made on margins with adjusted EBITDA margin up over 55 points from a year ago.  Now let's review Q2 revenues. Total net revenues were $486 million, a 10% increase from Q1 as net interest and other revenues increased during the quarter. Q2 ARPU was $84, up from $77 last quarter and the highest level since 2021.  Transaction based revenues were $193 million in Q2, down 7% sequentially, primarily due to lower crypto volumes and lower options revenue per contract.  Moving to net interest revenues, they were $234 million in Q2, up 13% sequentially. The increase was driven by higher interest earning assets, short term interest rates and securities lending activity. Q2 interest earning assets were $26 billion, up 16% or $4 billion sequentially, primarily driven by Gold customers continuing to bring more deposits to Robinhood.  Looking ahead, we anticipate Q3 net interest revenues will increase in the zone of $15 million versus Q2. This outlook assumes securities lending revenue in line with Q2, the addition of X1 and today's level of balances, deposit rates and Fed fund rates. Of course, our Q3 results could be higher or lower depending on how the quarter plays out.  Moving on to other revenues, they were $59 million in Q2, up $33 million from Q1, primarily due to seasonally higher proxy revenues. Looking ahead, we anticipate Q3 other revenues will return to the mid $20 million zone, given typical proxy seasonality.  I also want to share some color on what we saw in July. Accounts and assets continued to grow as customers deposited into their accounts and equity valuations increased during the month. July net deposits were roughly in line with the Q2 monthly average. In addition, as Vlad alluded to, we saw trading volumes pick up in equities, options and crypto compared to our Q2 monthly averages.  Finally, margin and cash sweep balances continued to grow from their Q2 levels. We're glad to see our customers continue to engage on the platform and look forward to sharing our full monthly metrics in a couple of weeks.  Now let's review Q2 expenses, starting with off OpEx prior to SBC. It was $357 million in Q2, at the lower end of our prior outlook range. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we're getting more efficient. So even while onboarding X1, we are keeping the midpoint of our full year outlook range unchanged.  We're also tightening our ranges. We're now halfway through the year. Taken together, our updated outlook for 2023 OpEx prior to SBC is a range of $1.43 billion to $1.47 billion.  Turning to SBC, it was $109 million in Q2, right around the lower end of our prior full-year outlook range. Looking ahead, given the progress we've made through the first half of the year, we're lowering our SBC outlook again this quarter. Our updated outlook for 2023 SBC is a range of $900 million to $940 million, which implies SBC will continue to improve in the second half of the year.  Our progress here means that our outlook for 2023 dilution has also improved. We now expect our diluted share count, which was 961 million at the end of 2022, to increase by 3% or less this year.  Turning to capital management. Our balance sheet is strong with over $6 billion of cash and investments. We use a small portion of that to run our business day to day, so we have billions of excess cash to deploy.  In addition, we are now profitable on a GAAP basis, and we generated nearly $400 million of adjusted EBITDA over the past 12 months. So we believe we are well positioned to deploy capital over time to drive growth and shareholder value.  One way we deploy capital is M&A that accelerates our long term product roadmap. In Q2, we acquired X1, which we see as a capital efficient way to bring a great new capability to our customers. The X1 platform provides their roughly 80,000 card holders a no fee, stainless steel credit card with attractive rewards on each purchase. And we're incredibly excited to begin offering credit to Robinhood's 23 million customers.  Looking ahead, we continue to look for M&A opportunities like this that can complement our organic product development efforts and are a good strategic, financial and cultural fit with Robinhood.  Another way we plan to deploy capital over time is through share repurchases. As you know, we've been working for the past six months to purchase the 55 million Robinhood shares that Emergent Fidelity bought last summer. We continue to have discussions and we'll update you when we have more to share.  In closing, I'm really pleased with the financial progress we've made over the past year, while continuing to deliver new capabilities and enhancing customer experience. Q2 was our first quarter of GAAP profitability as a public company and fifth consecutive quarter of revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. And we're not done. We continue to focus on driving profitable growth over time.  With that, Chris, let's go ahead and move to Q&A.\nA - Chris Koegel: Thank you, Jason. For the Q&A session, we'll start by answering shareholder questions from Say Technologies. These are ranked by the number of votes. We'll pass over any questions that we already addressed on this call or in prior quarters. We'll also group together questions that share a common theme. After that, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So I'll kick it off with our first question from Say. This one's for Jason. [Suraj P] (ph) asks, what is the reason top management keeps selling stock?\nJason Warnick: We want to have management align their interests with our shareholders. And we think our compensation structure does that. So most of our management team's compensation is in the form of stock. And because of this, it's normal for a management team to sell a small portion of their holdings as income. So management sets up automatic selling plans. They're called 10b5-1s, well in advance of the trades that you might see come through. These are automatic and they sell small portions of their stock over time.  As you look across our management team, you'll also see that we continue to be large holders in Robinhood stock. And certainly we're highly motivated to create shareholder value.\nChris Koegel: The next question comes from Lance G, who asks, can you provide an update on the 24 Hour Trading and how it's going? Vlad, do you want to take that one?\nVlad Tenev: We were super excited to launch 24 Hour Market. We were the first US broker to offer 24 hour trading of single name stocks, and we rolled it out to 100% of our customers in July, just a few weeks ago. And we'll be adding nine new tickers soon to trade 24/5.  Plus, especially for those of you that are in the New York City area, you may have seen us doing some marketing around it. We're hearing great feedback from our customers, particularly those that trade more actively, and we're continuing to invest to make the offering even better.\nChris Koegel: The next question is from a [Atanu M] (ph) who asks, do you have a plan for share buybacks to regain investor confidence? Robinhood has been way under IPO valuation for more than a year now. What is your plan to rebuild investor confidence? Jason, do you want to take that one?\nJason Warnick: Thanks for the question and also the feedback. There's a number of ways that we're working on delivering value for shareholders over time. First, we're investing organically in our business. And you hear us talk about the new products that we've recently delivered as well as ones that are on the roadmap, and we're super excited about that.  Second, we've got a super strong balance sheet and we're using it for M&A as a way for us to move faster. You saw that this quarter with our acquisition of X1. I also think there's more opportunities like this, and we're looking out for them.  And as you mentioned, share repurchases is another lever. And as you know, we continue to work on purchasing the 55 million shares that were acquired by Emergent Fidelity. Over time, we'll consider other ways to return capital to our shareholders.  In terms of our more recent financial progress, we've hit some pretty big milestones for the business. Our revenues in Q2 are up over 50% from last year, our costs are down hundreds of millions, and this led to us generating nearly $400 million of adjusted EBITDA in the last 12 months. We've also reached a new high of 31% adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter. So really happy about that. And of course, really proud that we've reached GAAP profitability for the first time as a public company with $0.03 per share.  So all in, I think we're in a great position. And we've got really good momentum to deliver even better results for customers over time and shareholders.\nChris Koegel: The next couple of questions, I think, maybe Vlad and Jason can share. So [Anuj B] (ph) asks, can you talk about the acquisition of credit card provider X1? How does this strategically help Robinhood with future plans? Was X1 a profitable company at the time of the purchase agreement? And will this bring more users and Gold users to Robinhood? And then [Omer D] (ph) asks, how will X1 be integrated into Robinhood exactly? Vlad you want to start?\nVlad Tenev: I'd be happy to start. We're really excited to work with X1 and the team over there to build a category-defining consumer credit business. We think the opportunity is incredibly strategic for Robinhood and incredibly useful for our customers.  One of the goals for Robinhood, as I mentioned earlier in the call, is we want to help customers not just trade and invest, but perform a wide variety of their financial needs. And we want to be their financial home and provide easy to use accessible interfaces and high value products.  Credit is a space that's incredibly important to many of our customers. It's something that we've been exploring for many years. And it directly addresses a lot of feedback that we've been getting from customers. A lot of our customers want a Robinhood credit card from us.  And it aligns well in our mission. We believe that we can actually do something really good here and provide credit to people who haven't always had easy access \u2013 young people, students and immigrants.  And one of the things we really, really liked about joining with X1 is, like Robinhood, they think of this as a technology problem. And they leverage technology to build a simple and seamless user experience. So, I think it's going to be great for customers, great for shareholders as we scale the product. And I'll defer to Jason for some of the financial details.\nJason Warnick: At the time of the purchase, X1 had about 80,000 card holders. We haven't provided other details on their finances prior to the acquisition because really we think the big picture here is that this deal is really about the opportunity to scale credit with our 23 million customers and less so about X1's finances prior to the deal.  Qualitatively, I'd say that their business was growing leading into the acquisition. We really liked the quality of their credit and underwriting, so we're in a good spot. And the overall economics were also improving as well.  In terms of integration, right now, we are integrating the team and we're working closely together on strategy. And Deepak is reporting directly into Vlad. So super excited about the potential here and we'll share more updates as we make progress. \nVlad Tenev: I'll also just say that I was at dinner with Deepak last night and he pulled out a prototype for the new Robinhood credit card. And it's beautiful and I'm very excited to share with our customers.\nChris Koegel: The next question is from Gustavo Gph who asks, when will bonds, CDs, et cetera, be introduced to Robinhood? Vlad, do you want to take that one?\nVlad Tenev: Thanks for the feedback. We're always listening to customers and we want to make sure that we offer an expanding selection of products and services over time. I would like for you and for all Robinhood customers to be able to use us for all of your needs and not have to turn to other providers for investments.  Today, we have some similar products. For example, bond ETFs and Robinhood Gold that offers 4.9% on uninvested cash with up to $2 million in FDIC insurance. But we know that there's more things that we have to add, and we're not going to stop. So over time, you'll see us continuing to listen to customers and adding even more investment options.\nChris Koegel: The next one is also for you. Victor S asks, when will AI capabilities begin appearing in the application?\nVlad Tenev: Thanks for your question. AI is really important. It's a strategic shift in how Robinhood and many companies will have to think about operating their business, and something I think about a lot. Over time, to be competitive, we think every company will need to become an AI company. And I think given our track record of innovation and the technologies that make up the Robinhood offering, we think we're naturally positioned to become the leader in financial services for AI. We're excited to explore further how the technology can improve all aspects of the Robinhood experience for our customers and create efficiencies in how we offer our products and run our business. We're actively engaged also in recruiting high quality talent to lead these efforts at Robinhood.\nChris Koegel: The next question is from Richard B, who asks, is it too early to think that Robinhood is strong enough to do dividends? Jason, do you want to take that one?\nJason Warnick: I think we're in a really strong place as a company. We've got over $6 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. We've got record margins this quarter, and we just reached GAAP profitability. So I'm really liking the strength of the business and the position that we're in right now.  In terms of returning value to shareholders, the traditional debate is share repurchases versus dividends. Personally, I'm more inclined to use share repurchases. And on that front, as we mentioned, we're working on purchasing the 55 million Emergent Fidelity shares and we'll share more on that as we make some progress.\nChris Koegel: I think we have time for one more Say question. So I'm going to put together two. So Thomas P asks, how is the growth in retirement accounts been? Have you been seeing many people transferring accounts over to Robinhood for the 1% match? And Michael A asks, does Robinhood ever plan to offer employer sponsored retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s? Vlad, do you want to take that one?\nVlad Tenev: I\u2019d be happy to field that. Glad to hear of the continuing interest in our retirement offerings. We're very proud of our retirement offering. It gives our customers another tool that they can use to control their finances and build wealth over time.  Customers love the 1% match. And today, we announced the 3% match for our Gold customers. The progress so far has been great. We're approaching $1 billion in AUM, and we have seen a big pickup in transfers from other institutions for the 1% match.  Regarding the second question about employer sponsored accounts, we think it's a space that is begging to be disrupted, frankly. We don't have this on the near term roadmap, but definitely wouldn't rule it out.  That said, there are also tons of individuals who don't receive a match from their employer today. So if you're an employee without a match, come to Robinhood and we will match for you.\nChris Koegel: And that concludes our shareholder questions from Say Technologies. We appreciate our shareholders taking time to ask these questions of Vlad and Jason, and we look forward to more next quarter.  Now we'll turn the call over to Gigi to lead Q&A from our analysts.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: I guess first question on expenses. The headcount reduction that you noted, I think the press reported 7% in June, I'm assuming the one-time costs associated with that are in the guide. And then I guess I'm curious if there's any future cost savings that could come with that [if that is material assuming] (ph) others, but I would assume there's still probably something related to that.\nJason Warnick: Devin, we did have some one-time costs on that reduction. It's included in the OpEx that we reported for Q2. And we viewed these changes as more of kind of ongoing management of costs. And so, we did not exclude them from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA this quarter.  And then in terms of kind of go forward, the effects of the forward cost savings on the reductions, as well as the additional costs of integrating X1 are all factored into the OpEx guide that we gave, and we tightened the range there and left the midpoint unchanged for the rest of the year.\nDevin Ryan: In terms of just some of the improvements you're seeing in investor engagement, obviously, you mentioned some transaction activity recently and we're seeing margin balances stabilize and improve and still good deposit trends. Sounds like all that's continuing into July. Just want to get a little sense of whether this is really kind of in the active trader cohort or if you're seeing some of these improvements across the customer base more broadly.  Just at a higher level, kind of what you're hearing from different customer cohorts around their interest in trading. We've obviously been in a pretty tough and exhausting, I think, market for the past 18 months. Just where sentiment is today. Sounds like some early signs of maybe recovery. So love to talk about that.\nJason Warnick: I'll maybe lead and then, Vlad, you can weigh in a little bit as well. So, overall, the sentiment from our customers about Robinhood is improving. We talked about improvements in NPS year-over-year last quarter, overall up 20 points year-over-year on average and up over 30 points for our more active traders, which is really encouraging. And we're continuing just to focus in on user experience and doing things like adding stock screeners and scanners as well as Robinhood's 24 hour market. So I think our investors are noticing. Vlad mentioned an increase in market share year-over-year, both in equities up 15% and options up over 20%.  And as I look at kind of deposits, customers continue to deposit their funds with Robinhood, over $4 billion in the quarter. And we continue to see strong deposits in July. And trading kind of picked up throughout the quarter. April, I think was seasonally low and then we just accelerated as the quarter progressed. And July was also good as we commented in our more formal comments.  So, overall, I would say that the work that we've been doing, improving user experience and product selection is really showing through for our customers.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, I don't really have much to add. We've been really pleased by our progress. Jason mentioned and reiterated the market share gains. And I think the NPS improvements, particularly for active traders, have been really good. It's been really good to see that translating to market share gains across all the assets that our customers trade.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho.\nDan Dolev: Great results. And I don't know if this was addressed. But we did some work that showed that you were gaining share from your competitor in crypto. So apologies if this was addressed. But is there anything you can call out on why you're gaining share? What is driving the share gains at Robinhood in crypto from your biggest competitor? And then I have a quick follow up.\nJason Warnick: It's a little harder in crypto to measure market share. It's not as easy as it is with equities and options. But by our analysis, it does look like we're gaining share in the coins that we offer.  In terms of why, I'd probably point to the value proposition. We think we're the best place for retail traders to buy crypto for the coins that we offer. And also, we think we've got just a great user experience. And so, those are the two things.\nVlad Tenev: I'd also add that we've offered customers great value in addition to a great customer experience. Like at Robinhood, you get more crypto for your dollar than most of our competitors. And I think we've started to do a better job communicating that in the user interface. So, we're making it incredibly clear to \u2013 we're trying to make it more and more clear to customers, just how good of a value they're getting.  And, of course, I'd add that it's very important for us to be the most trusted and safest company in crypto. And I think with all the turmoil in the space over the past year or so, I think there has been a little bit of a flight to safety. And we're seeing that reflected in some of the market share gains you're seeing and that's something that we'd like to continue to invest in.\nDan Dolev: Pretty amazing, great stuff. And then a quick follow up. Great progress on the retirement stuff. And we're very excited about this year at Mizuho. Is it a fair statement to say that, over time, as this grows, this is going to show up in, obviously, like, bigger impact on MAUs, and the MAUs \u2013 it'll kind of \u2013 cause a positive inflection in the MAUs because of the retirement account, the retirement offering? \nVlad Tenev: MAUs did increase from May to June. Of course, when you think about all the things we've been focused on as a company and on the product side over the past year, they haven't naturally flown into MAUs because, even retirement itself, it's sort of a passive long term investing product, and not typically a product that you associate with sort of like active trading or engagement, although there's advantages for all types of investors with retirement products.  Active trader investments, active traders are kind of a relatively small subset of the overall user base. So they drive a disproportionate amount of revenue, and making them really, really happy. You're probably not going to see that as reflected in the MAU metric. So, we've made a lot of progress over the past year. And I think that's been progress that's sort of like on another axis than MAUs and trader engagement.  That said, we are working on a bunch of things that we think will bring more customers and more transactors into Robinhood. And we do expect, over the long run, the MAU metric to follow in \u2013 there's a lot of investments in place that that we think will pay off for us there.\nJason Warnick: One of the things, Dan, that I'm really excited about is our continuing investment in Gold that really deepens the relationships with our customers. We offer them 4.9% on their cash sweep balances. And as we announced today, a 3% retirement match. And so, I think as we deepen our relationships with our customers, as we expand our product selection, you're going to naturally see engagement tick up over time.\nDan Dolev: Yeah, I\u2019d agree. Great results. Congrats again. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. \nSteven Chubak: Why don't I start with a question on expense? You guys have done a nice job delivering efficiency gains while executing on the product roadmap. That said, your expense per employee is still relatively elevated when we benchmark versus fintech as well as retail brokerage peers. I want to get a sense as to where you see this metric projecting as the business scales and as you expand your geographic footprint.\nJason Warnick: I would generally agree with you. We've been focused on reducing our costs and rationalizing the headcount. And our intention is to be lean and scrappy in the way that we grow our business and drive leverage to our business over time. And so, we've been focused on our cost per employee, as you pointed out.  One of the changes that we made earlier this year is we moved from a stock based award program that grants four year awards to a program that grants awards that vest over one year, and we think that that's a prudent way to do it.  Another thing, as we look at our employee footprint, we're very heavily concentrated in higher cost areas in the US and that represents an opportunity for us to balance out the mix of geographies that we work in as Robinhood employees. So, it's something that we're working on and I see that as an opportunity.\nSteven Chubak: Really helpful color. Speaking of operating leverage, I did want to ask on the profitability outlook. Looking ahead, just now you've reached GAAP profitability. Remind us how you're thinking about normalized GAAP margins for the business at scale. And now that you've hit this milestone, was hoping you can give us an update on what the next milestone is that you're aspiring to.\nJason Warnick: Look, long term, what I'd tell you is that our objective is to maximize GAAP EPS and free cash flow per share. We're not giving any specific near term milestone targets there. But when I look at the cost structure of our business, it heavily skews towards fixed costs and less so towards variable costs, which if you can manage those fixed costs really effectively, as you grow your top line, you can deliver a lot of leverage to the bottom line. And so, as I think about, like, what kind of margins are possible for this business, I don't see any reason why we can't deliver the kinds of margins that you see in other financial services companies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Maybe just starting with the active trader opportunity set, I was hoping you might be able to update us on the opportunity set with futures. I know you guys have some plans to launch that this year. I believe maybe you can update us on the progress there and the build out.  Similarly, on cash-settled index options, where is that on the priority list? And what sort of investment is required on your platform to enable that? Or could you just flip the switch and enable that today?\nVlad Tenev: Futures is something that we're very excited about. We have been spending a lot of time thinking through how to make a really, really great customer experience, particularly on mobile because as we look at the other offerings in the market, we think that there's a gap that we can fill with user experience, particularly on mobile. So we're spending a lot of time thinking through that, talking to customers. And we're putting together a really, really nice offering. Right now, we're estimating that it'll land in the first half of 2024. And the team is hard at work, just making the product as great as possible for our customers.  I think on the cash-settled options front, we're also hearing that from customers that that's an attractive product and will enable them to manage their risk. That's also slated to land in the first half of 2024.\nMichael Cyprys: Just a follow-up question on the X1 acquisition. I was hoping you could talk about your go-to-market strategy for how you're thinking about bringing the card offering to your existing customer set and broadening it out over time. Where do you think there's room in the marketplace for differentiation?  Can you talk about the underwriting process and the criteria there, just given some of the potential customers may not have much income or credit history? How do you get comfortable and manage the credit risk that this introduces?\nVlad Tenev: I think that\u2019s a great question. In terms of go-to-market, we kind of see two near term opportunities that are interesting. One is just making a great card available to sort of the typical Robinhood customer. Robinhood customers, a lot of them are credit card primary. And we've been hearing lots of feedback from them on what types of offerings they would like. And we think that we can make something that's really, really compelling for them.  We also see an opportunity \u2013 and I mentioned this a little bit earlier \u2013 for people who are younger, maybe college students, people with limited credit history, but reasonable earning potential like immigrants, who have a hard time getting credit right now. And we think with technology and the underwriting capabilities that X1 has offered and has kind of been improving over time, we can build something really, really good for them as well.  Of course, credit is an incredibly important market, a large space as a business. There's a lot of margin to be had there, so we're not just going to stop there. We want to build a suite of comprehensive credit solutions across multiple products for our customers. So this is just the beginning. But when we think \u2013 even within credit cards, there's a massive opportunity for us.\nJason Warnick: One of the things that we were really excited about for the X1 team is just the quality of their team around underwriting. And we were really impressed with the high quality nature of their loan book. It's prime, prime plus. So really happy with that.  And in terms of their underwriting, they look at things like income and credit bureau and the normal things that you'd expect the teams to be looking at. \nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you, and congrats on the profitability milestone this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from J.P. Morgan.\nKen Worthington: I wanted to follow up on the monthly users question earlier. So a couple of points here. Maybe first, you have 23 million accounts and MAU is about 11. So, first, funded accounts were at their highs in 2Q and market conditions have been improving in what, I guess I'd call, the more innovative part of the stock market this year. But MAUs were at their lows in 2Q. So I guess maybe first, does this relationship between MAUs and funded accounts seem sort of reasonable to you over time.  Maybe second, as we look at this, call it, 10 million account gap between the two, what portion of these inactive accounts are ones that you think you can get to re-engage in normal market conditions or if market conditions stay normal sort of over time?\nJason Warnick: One of the one things that is a weakness of MAUs is it's measuring engagement just for those that engaged in the month. And for more active traders, I think that there's a fairly high correlation there. But for the broader set of customers, less so. And we provided a couple quarters ago some context that MAUs for all of Q4 was 16 million and for the past six months was over 20 million. And so, it's not that they're dormant customer accounts, it's that they're just not necessarily engaging every single month. And for a lot of people, it's actually a very normal and healthy amount of engagement.  I do think, over time, as we broaden our product selection and deepen relationships with customers that you're going to see a more consistent relationship between MAUs and total funded accounts. But in the shorter term right now, we have seen those kind of move in opposite directions.\nVlad Tenev: I'd also add that there's sort of an asset dependency here, like the brokerage side with equities, and particularly growth stocks, like that market has been doing rather well in Q2, but crypto has kind of continued to soften. So you sort of see multiple conflicting things. And that can be reflected in the MAU numbers because a significant percentage of our customer base is customers that trade crypto as well.\nJason Warnick: MAUs, Ken, moved up a little bit in June versus May and it moved up a little bit more in July. So it appears to be stabilizing and kind of moving back up a little bit.\nKen Worthington: Just two simple numbers questions. So thanks for the retirement and the Gold account numbers. Any chance that you would give us fully paid sec lending accounts and clients that have opted to use the cash card?\nJason Warnick: Fully paid is 1.5 million. Cash card, offhand, it's a couple hundred thousand, I think, that are funded and about a million that have signed up. And I think the X1 acquisition really doubles down on the spending strategy. We want Robinhood to be a place to handle all of our customers' critical financial needs. And we want them to be able to spend with debit cards or credit cards really at their choice. And so, X1 and the cash card I think are a nice complement to each other.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish from Barclays.\nBen Budish: I wanted to follow up on actually Mike's question from earlier on X1. Jason, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that I think there's some credit \u2013 some interest income expected to come. And that's related to X1. Can you maybe talk about the revenue profile you're expecting for Robinhood between interest income and interchange revenues? And how much credit exposure does Robinhood sort of take on with the acquisition?\nJason Warnick: The comments I made in the prepared remarks is that we expect interest income kind of, all in, including X1, to increase sequentially in the zone of about $15 million. So, X1 was a part of that.  When I think about the geography for revenues for X1, you've got the interest income that you earn on revolving credit. That's offset by the cost of funding and presented net for interest income. You'll have some interchange revenue, but our accounting conclusion on that looks to be \u2013 that it'll be netted with the rewards costs. So, that'll be in transaction based revenue, but presented net. So, that's kind of the accounting overlay for X1.  In terms of the possibility, X1 has 80,000 cardholders at the time of the acquisition. We have 23 million customers that have a very nice credit profile. And I think, over time, we can make some strategy decisions that will make credit really broadly available to our customer set, regardless of their background. So I think there's a big opportunity, and I'm excited to see the team work against that.\nVlad Tenev: I would just add that one of the reasons we got excited about acquiring this company and this team versus pursuing kind of the traditional partnership credit card model is that if you think about X1, we do have access to both transaction based interchange revenue and also the kind of more recurrent sticky lending revenue. And this gives us an opportunity to build a diversified business and offer differentiated value to customers because we have access to a much greater percentage of the overall profit pool than we would under a kind of your typical co-brand partnership model, which tends to be more one time bounty based, coupled with the interchange revenue share.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: My question is on the UK brokerage launch. So I'm curious how you're going to monetize this effort as the PFOF rules are different in the UK than in the US with payment for order flow ban. \nJason Warnick: We're mindful of the regulatory environment in all the geographies that we operate in. What I'd say is there's a number of revenue streams that are available for us. The team is still working out the details there, but certainly sec lending and interest income. So there's a number of ways. We do in the US have a Gold offering. I think there's a good potential for this to be an attractive business on a unit economic perspective with or without payment for order flow.\nVlad Tenev: And a big focus for us has been, since we are a technology company, expanding internationally in a capital efficient manner without sort of excessive investments in headcount.\nCraig Siegenthaler: I know you don't reported exactly this, just curious also on the high level trends in both cash equities and equity options on the revenue per trade trend in the second quarter of 2023 versus the same period last year.\nJason Warnick: On options, we are seeing kind of across the industry that the take rate on options trading has been coming down. This is really reflective of the overall lower volatility in the market, and also a shift that's been seen kind of industrywide on a greater share towards ETF options. And so, for the quarter in Q2, the take rate was $0.45. That was the average for the quarter. It did come down as we progress through the quarter. And it's bounced back up in July slightly versus June to about $0.42 per contract. So, that's what we've been seeing there. And we've been keeping an eye on it. \nOperator: At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Vlad Tenev for closing remarks. \nVlad Tenev: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thanks for the intro, Chris. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. Last week was the two year anniversary of our IPO and I'm excited to announce an important milestone today. In Q2, we reached GAAP profitability for the first time as a public company. I'm incredibly proud of our team for the resourcefulness and tenacity it took to ship innovative products, serve customers and manage expenses to reach this level.  Let me tell you more about our progress in Q2 starting with our business results. Customer assets under custody grew to $89 billion in Q2, up 13% from Q1, driven by higher equity valuations and continued net deposits. In July, customer assets continued to grow by several billion to over $90 billion. Looking at net deposits, we had over $4 billion in Q2, translating to a 21% annualized growth rate. This brings the total over the past year to over $16 billion as customers continue to trust Robinhood with billions of their investment dollars.  Looking at our financial results, in Q2, we grew total net revenues to $486 million, up 10% from Q1. And by keeping our costs lean, we drove nice operating leverage in our business with adjusted EBITDA margin increasing to a new high of 31%. These results contributed to GAAP net income of $25 million and EPS of positive $0.03.  I'd also highlight that two new products I mentioned last quarter, stock lending and instant withdrawals, continue to accelerate. Each had Q2 revenues that grew another 20% above their Q1 levels. The combined annualized Q2 revenue of these two products is over $90 million, which is roughly the size of our equity trading business. This is exciting progress, and I'm incredibly proud of how well our team is executing.  Now, let's turn to our 2023 roadmap, which, as you know, we've organized into three areas, deepening relationships with our customers, innovating for our active traders, and launching new growth opportunities.  Let's first talk about how we're deepening relationships with our more than 23 million existing customers. Our goal is to serve the entirety of our customers' financial needs. We started with trading and investing and, more recently, we launched spending, saving and retirement products.  We track our progress here by looking at net deposits and ARPU. In Q2, net deposits grew at a 21% annualized growth rate and ARPU increased to $84, the highest level in the past two years. We're also making great progress growing assets per customer. Over the past year, AUC per customer increased 37% on average and 88% for Gold customers.  One focus has been helping customers save and invest their long term money. As a reminder, in January, we launched Robinhood Retirement, the first IRA with a 1% match, no employer necessary, and it's great to see that IRA assets are now close to $1 billion. We believe retirement can grow into a much larger part of our business, especially as we add additional products like Advisory.  Last quarter, I mentioned that we're really happy with the progress we've made with Robinhood Gold and that we're going to be adding even more features and value to the offering. To that end, we are introducing a 3% IRA match for Gold customers, 3 times our standard 1% match. We believe this offer makes Gold incredibly compelling for retirement customers that aren't already Gold subscribers, and will also help us grow retirement business.  Gold cash sweep, which offers customers up to $2 million in FDIC insurance and among the most competitive yields on cash, is also continuing to grow. Gold cash sweep balances grew nearly 40% in Q2 and 130% year-to-date to reach $11 billion. Last week, we increased the interest rate to 4.9%.  As we've attracted and engaged more Gold customers, we've seen them deposit more into their Robinhood accounts. And this continues to drive strong ARPU and revenue growth from our Gold customers. With our competitive 4.9% rate on cash and the new 3% IRA match, we're starting to spin this flywheel even faster.  Now, let me talk a bit about the X1 acquisition. We view credit as a strategic opportunity to both help customers and diversify our business. Many of our 23 million customers are credit card primary. And we also see an opportunity to go down market and help younger people build credit. Right now, for example, if you're an immigrant or a student, it's hard to get credit even if you have the salary and earnings potential to support it. This is one of the problems we're excited to solve. And by doing so, we believe we will grow our customer base, diversify our revenues, further deepen our relationship with our customers.  After exploring the credit space for several years, with X1, we finally found a team that has the right values and DNA to build and scale a category defining consumer credit business. X1 provides their 80,000 card holders with an awesome stainless steel card, attractive customer rewards and a sleek and user friendly mobile platform. The team is working hard to ship a great new Robinhood card that we're excited to offer to our 23 million customers, and we'll expand from there.  Now let's discuss active traders. As you know, over the past year, we continue to aggressively ship products and features to make Robinhood the best destination for active traders. These include advanced charts, cash accounts, strategy builder, stock screeners and, most recently, Robinhood 24 Hour Market.  With 24 hour market, we are the first US retail brokerage to offer 24/5 trading of single name stocks. We finished the rollout to 100% of our customers in July and we love the early uptake we see. We've seen strong volumes in our extended hours offering, particularly during earnings season, and Robinhood 24 Hour Market makes it even easier for customers to trade whenever they want. We're excited to continue to expand the selection of names we offer, and we will be adding nine more tickets quite soon, bringing our total to 52.  As we continue to enhance the experience for active traders, we're seeing our market share of retail trading grow. Last quarter, I mentioned that we were happy with the trajectory that our options trading product was on. We were starting to turn more of our attention to our core equities business.  In addition to 24 hour market, we shipped several tools and enhancements for our active equities traders, including longer chart history, returns comparison tools, and our awesome new screeners and scanners. And just a few hours ago, we rolled out instant deposits and cash accounts to all users.  Customers love these improvements, and we're seeing that in our market share. In Q2, equity market share was up 15% from a year ago, and our options market share was up over 20% from a year ago. So far in Q3, our market share continues to move higher in both equities and options. And we're working on many more improvements that we can't wait to share with customers.  Turning to crypto, we continue to innovate and grow market share while staying mindful of applicable regulations. Our goal is to be the safest, most trusted place for customers to hold, trade and transact with their crypto. We see our recent launches of Robinhood Wallet and Robinhood Connect resonating with customers and we look forward to continuing to invest in crypto.  The third part of our 2023 roadmap is exploring new growth opportunities to broaden the scope and geographical reach of our products, so we can add more customers and increase our revenues over time. We remain focused on our ambitious goal of launching brokerage operations in the UK around the end of year. As you know, we have an existing license in place, a brand that resonates and experienced leaders like JB MacKenzie running the effort. We've been spending a lot of time with customers and are starting to hire key positions on the ground, including bringing on Jordan Sinclair to lead Robinhood UK. We're getting even more excited to drive innovation in the UK market, like we've done in the US.  Another business we recently launched is Sherwood Media, a new media company that is focused on providing the best financial content covering the markets, economics, business, technology and the culture of money.  Our goal is to build on the success of Robinhood Snacks, which is one of the largest financial newsletters in the US with over 10 million weekly readers. We've already started signing multiyear advertising partnerships with NASDAQ, CBOE and other partners.  We're excited about our progress across multiple geographies and business lines. We believe these investments will enable us to serve more customers, while also growing and diversifying our revenues.  As I reflect on all that Robinhood has accomplished so far in our history, I'm energized by our even larger potential over the next decade. We're really excited about the roadmap ahead of us and there's so much to do. We see a huge opportunity to innovate for our customers, grow assets, gain market share, and change the industry for the better, as we democratize finance for all our 23 million customers and many more to come.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jason. We were super excited to launch 24 Hour Market. We were the first US broker to offer 24 hour trading of single name stocks, and we rolled it out to 100% of our customers in July, just a few weeks ago. And we'll be adding nine new tickers soon to trade 24/5.  Plus, especially for those of you that are in the New York City area, you may have seen us doing some marketing around it. We're hearing great feedback from our customers, particularly those that trade more actively, and we're continuing to invest to make the offering even better. I'd be happy to start. We're really excited to work with X1 and the team over there to build a category-defining consumer credit business. We think the opportunity is incredibly strategic for Robinhood and incredibly useful for our customers.  One of the goals for Robinhood, as I mentioned earlier in the call, is we want to help customers not just trade and invest, but perform a wide variety of their financial needs. And we want to be their financial home and provide easy to use accessible interfaces and high value products.  Credit is a space that's incredibly important to many of our customers. It's something that we've been exploring for many years. And it directly addresses a lot of feedback that we've been getting from customers. A lot of our customers want a Robinhood credit card from us.  And it aligns well in our mission. We believe that we can actually do something really good here and provide credit to people who haven't always had easy access \u2013 young people, students and immigrants.  And one of the things we really, really liked about joining with X1 is, like Robinhood, they think of this as a technology problem. And they leverage technology to build a simple and seamless user experience. So, I think it's going to be great for customers, great for shareholders as we scale the product. And I'll defer to Jason for some of the financial details. I'll also just say that I was at dinner with Deepak last night and he pulled out a prototype for the new Robinhood credit card. And it's beautiful and I'm very excited to share with our customers. Thanks for the feedback. We're always listening to customers and we want to make sure that we offer an expanding selection of products and services over time. I would like for you and for all Robinhood customers to be able to use us for all of your needs and not have to turn to other providers for investments.  Today, we have some similar products. For example, bond ETFs and Robinhood Gold that offers 4.9% on uninvested cash with up to $2 million in FDIC insurance. But we know that there's more things that we have to add, and we're not going to stop. So over time, you'll see us continuing to listen to customers and adding even more investment options. Thanks for your question. AI is really important. It's a strategic shift in how Robinhood and many companies will have to think about operating their business, and something I think about a lot. Over time, to be competitive, we think every company will need to become an AI company. And I think given our track record of innovation and the technologies that make up the Robinhood offering, we think we're naturally positioned to become the leader in financial services for AI. We're excited to explore further how the technology can improve all aspects of the Robinhood experience for our customers and create efficiencies in how we offer our products and run our business. We're actively engaged also in recruiting high quality talent to lead these efforts at Robinhood. I'd be happy to field that. Glad to hear of the continuing interest in our retirement offerings. We're very proud of our retirement offering. It gives our customers another tool that they can use to control their finances and build wealth over time.  Customers love the 1% match. And today, we announced the 3% match for our Gold customers. The progress so far has been great. We're approaching $1 billion in AUM, and we have seen a big pickup in transfers from other institutions for the 1% match.  Regarding the second question about employer sponsored accounts, we think it's a space that is begging to be disrupted, frankly. We don't have this on the near term roadmap, but definitely wouldn't rule it out.  That said, there are also tons of individuals who don't receive a match from their employer today. So if you're an employee without a match, come to Robinhood and we will match for you. Yeah, I don't really have much to add. We've been really pleased by our progress. Jason mentioned and reiterated the market share gains. And I think the NPS improvements, particularly for active traders, have been really good. It's been really good to see that translating to market share gains across all the assets that our customers trade. I'd also add that we've offered customers great value in addition to a great customer experience. Like at Robinhood, you get more crypto for your dollar than most of our competitors. And I think we've started to do a better job communicating that in the user interface. So, we're making it incredibly clear to \u2013 we're trying to make it more and more clear to customers, just how good of a value they're getting.  And, of course, I'd add that it's very important for us to be the most trusted and safest company in crypto. And I think with all the turmoil in the space over the past year or so, I think there has been a little bit of a flight to safety. And we're seeing that reflected in some of the market share gains you're seeing and that's something that we'd like to continue to invest in. MAUs did increase from May to June. Of course, when you think about all the things we've been focused on as a company and on the product side over the past year, they haven't naturally flown into MAUs because, even retirement itself, it's sort of a passive long term investing product, and not typically a product that you associate with sort of like active trading or engagement, although there's advantages for all types of investors with retirement products.  Active trader investments, active traders are kind of a relatively small subset of the overall user base. So they drive a disproportionate amount of revenue, and making them really, really happy. You're probably not going to see that as reflected in the MAU metric. So, we've made a lot of progress over the past year. And I think that's been progress that's sort of like on another axis than MAUs and trader engagement.  That said, we are working on a bunch of things that we think will bring more customers and more transactors into Robinhood. And we do expect, over the long run, the MAU metric to follow in \u2013 there's a lot of investments in place that that we think will pay off for us there. Futures is something that we're very excited about. We have been spending a lot of time thinking through how to make a really, really great customer experience, particularly on mobile because as we look at the other offerings in the market, we think that there's a gap that we can fill with user experience, particularly on mobile. So we're spending a lot of time thinking through that, talking to customers. And we're putting together a really, really nice offering. Right now, we're estimating that it'll land in the first half of 2024. And the team is hard at work, just making the product as great as possible for our customers.  I think on the cash-settled options front, we're also hearing that from customers that that's an attractive product and will enable them to manage their risk. That's also slated to land in the first half of 2024. I think that's a great question. In terms of go-to-market, we kind of see two near term opportunities that are interesting. One is just making a great card available to sort of the typical Robinhood customer. Robinhood customers, a lot of them are credit card primary. And we've been hearing lots of feedback from them on what types of offerings they would like. And we think that we can make something that's really, really compelling for them.  We also see an opportunity \u2013 and I mentioned this a little bit earlier \u2013 for people who are younger, maybe college students, people with limited credit history, but reasonable earning potential like immigrants, who have a hard time getting credit right now. And we think with technology and the underwriting capabilities that X1 has offered and has kind of been improving over time, we can build something really, really good for them as well.  Of course, credit is an incredibly important market, a large space as a business. There's a lot of margin to be had there, so we're not just going to stop there. We want to build a suite of comprehensive credit solutions across multiple products for our customers. So this is just the beginning. But when we think \u2013 even within credit cards, there's a massive opportunity for us. I'd also add that there's sort of an asset dependency here, like the brokerage side with equities, and particularly growth stocks, like that market has been doing rather well in Q2, but crypto has kind of continued to soften. So you sort of see multiple conflicting things. And that can be reflected in the MAU numbers because a significant percentage of our customer base is customers that trade crypto as well. I would just add that one of the reasons we got excited about acquiring this company and this team versus pursuing kind of the traditional partnership credit card model is that if you think about X1, we do have access to both transaction based interchange revenue and also the kind of more recurrent sticky lending revenue. And this gives us an opportunity to build a diversified business and offer differentiated value to customers because we have access to a much greater percentage of the overall profit pool than we would under a kind of your typical co-brand partnership model, which tends to be more one time bounty based, coupled with the interchange revenue share. And a big focus for us has been, since we are a technology company, expanding internationally in a capital efficient manner without sort of excessive investments in headcount. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And we're very excited to continue innovating, delivering for customers. Thank you again for all the questions."

            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. After growing revenue for five straight quarters and getting lean on costs, in Q2, we reached GAAP profitability for the first time as a public company. I'm incredibly proud of our team for all of their progress over the past year, transforming the financial profile of our business and positioning us to drive long term shareholder value.  While we're excited about reaching this milestone, we're just getting started on the journey to drive higher levels of GAAP EPS over time. We remain focused on investing for growth to add new revenue streams, like securities lending and instant withdrawals, as well as gain market share in our existing businesses.  At the same time, we're working to get leaner in ways that don't detract from our growth. For example, in Q2, we made some targeted reductions across a few teams, where we saw increased productivity and opportunities for greater efficiency. We're confident that our growth and efficiency efforts can drive great outcomes for customers and shareholders over time.  Let's now look at how our business grew in the second quarter as we make progress on our mission. We measure our progress in terms of assets under custody and net funded accounts.  Our customers' assets under custody increased 13% sequentially in Q2 to $89 billion, primarily due to higher equity valuations and customers continuing to deposit money into Robinhood.  Looking at net deposits, they were $4.1 billion in Q2, which translates to a 21% annualized growth rate relative to Q1 AUC. We believe these resilient customer net deposits position us really well for continued asset growth, as markets rise over time.  Turning to net funded accounts, which represent unique customers on our platform, they increased to 23.2 million in Q2, up 70,000 from last quarter and 310,000 from a year ago. Additionally, we are excited about the growth we are seeing in our retirement product, which we launched in January. We now have over 325,000 funded retirement accounts, up 75,000 from last quarter, and Gold subscribers increased for the third quarter in a row to over 1.2 million, up about 60,000 sequentially and 150,000 since we launched the Gold yield high yield offering.  Looking at our financial results, we generated positive GAAP net income of $25 million in Q2 and EPS was $0.03. When we look at our $0.37 increase from a year ago, it's great to see the broad improvement across revenue, OpEx and SBC that led to the Q2 result.  In addition, we have continued to derive profitability higher on an adjusted EBITDA basis. It grew to a new high of $151 million in the quarter and our adjusted EBITDA margin also reached a new high of 31%. We are excited about the progress we've made on margins with adjusted EBITDA margin up over 55 points from a year ago.  Now let's review Q2 revenues. Total net revenues were $486 million, a 10% increase from Q1 as net interest and other revenues increased during the quarter. Q2 ARPU was $84, up from $77 last quarter and the highest level since 2021.  Transaction based revenues were $193 million in Q2, down 7% sequentially, primarily due to lower crypto volumes and lower options revenue per contract.  Moving to net interest revenues, they were $234 million in Q2, up 13% sequentially. The increase was driven by higher interest earning assets, short term interest rates and securities lending activity. Q2 interest earning assets were $26 billion, up 16% or $4 billion sequentially, primarily driven by Gold customers continuing to bring more deposits to Robinhood.  Looking ahead, we anticipate Q3 net interest revenues will increase in the zone of $15 million versus Q2. This outlook assumes securities lending revenue in line with Q2, the addition of X1 and today's level of balances, deposit rates and Fed fund rates. Of course, our Q3 results could be higher or lower depending on how the quarter plays out.  Moving on to other revenues, they were $59 million in Q2, up $33 million from Q1, primarily due to seasonally higher proxy revenues. Looking ahead, we anticipate Q3 other revenues will return to the mid $20 million zone, given typical proxy seasonality.  I also want to share some color on what we saw in July. Accounts and assets continued to grow as customers deposited into their accounts and equity valuations increased during the month. July net deposits were roughly in line with the Q2 monthly average. In addition, as Vlad alluded to, we saw trading volumes pick up in equities, options and crypto compared to our Q2 monthly averages.  Finally, margin and cash sweep balances continued to grow from their Q2 levels. We're glad to see our customers continue to engage on the platform and look forward to sharing our full monthly metrics in a couple of weeks.  Now let's review Q2 expenses, starting with off OpEx prior to SBC. It was $357 million in Q2, at the lower end of our prior outlook range. Looking forward to the second half of the year, we're getting more efficient. So even while onboarding X1, we are keeping the midpoint of our full year outlook range unchanged.  We're also tightening our ranges. We're now halfway through the year. Taken together, our updated outlook for 2023 OpEx prior to SBC is a range of $1.43 billion to $1.47 billion.  Turning to SBC, it was $109 million in Q2, right around the lower end of our prior full-year outlook range. Looking ahead, given the progress we've made through the first half of the year, we're lowering our SBC outlook again this quarter. Our updated outlook for 2023 SBC is a range of $900 million to $940 million, which implies SBC will continue to improve in the second half of the year.  Our progress here means that our outlook for 2023 dilution has also improved. We now expect our diluted share count, which was 961 million at the end of 2022, to increase by 3% or less this year.  Turning to capital management. Our balance sheet is strong with over $6 billion of cash and investments. We use a small portion of that to run our business day to day, so we have billions of excess cash to deploy.  In addition, we are now profitable on a GAAP basis, and we generated nearly $400 million of adjusted EBITDA over the past 12 months. So we believe we are well positioned to deploy capital over time to drive growth and shareholder value.  One way we deploy capital is M&A that accelerates our long term product roadmap. In Q2, we acquired X1, which we see as a capital efficient way to bring a great new capability to our customers. The X1 platform provides their roughly 80,000 card holders a no fee, stainless steel credit card with attractive rewards on each purchase. And we're incredibly excited to begin offering credit to Robinhood's 23 million customers.  Looking ahead, we continue to look for M&A opportunities like this that can complement our organic product development efforts and are a good strategic, financial and cultural fit with Robinhood.  Another way we plan to deploy capital over time is through share repurchases. As you know, we've been working for the past six months to purchase the 55 million Robinhood shares that Emergent Fidelity bought last summer. We continue to have discussions and we'll update you when we have more to share.  In closing, I'm really pleased with the financial progress we've made over the past year, while continuing to deliver new capabilities and enhancing customer experience. Q2 was our first quarter of GAAP profitability as a public company and fifth consecutive quarter of revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. And we're not done. We continue to focus on driving profitable growth over time.  With that, Chris, let's go ahead and move to Q&A. We want to have management align their interests with our shareholders. And we think our compensation structure does that. So most of our management team's compensation is in the form of stock. And because of this, it's normal for a management team to sell a small portion of their holdings as income. So management sets up automatic selling plans. They're called 10b5-1s, well in advance of the trades that you might see come through. These are automatic and they sell small portions of their stock over time.  As you look across our management team, you'll also see that we continue to be large holders in Robinhood stock. And certainly we're highly motivated to create shareholder value. Thanks for the question and also the feedback. There's a number of ways that we're working on delivering value for shareholders over time. First, we're investing organically in our business. And you hear us talk about the new products that we've recently delivered as well as ones that are on the roadmap, and we're super excited about that.  Second, we've got a super strong balance sheet and we're using it for M&A as a way for us to move faster. You saw that this quarter with our acquisition of X1. I also think there's more opportunities like this, and we're looking out for them.  And as you mentioned, share repurchases is another lever. And as you know, we continue to work on purchasing the 55 million shares that were acquired by Emergent Fidelity. Over time, we'll consider other ways to return capital to our shareholders.  In terms of our more recent financial progress, we've hit some pretty big milestones for the business. Our revenues in Q2 are up over 50% from last year, our costs are down hundreds of millions, and this led to us generating nearly $400 million of adjusted EBITDA in the last 12 months. We've also reached a new high of 31% adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter. So really happy about that. And of course, really proud that we've reached GAAP profitability for the first time as a public company with $0.03 per share.  So all in, I think we're in a great position. And we've got really good momentum to deliver even better results for customers over time and shareholders. At the time of the purchase, X1 had about 80,000 card holders. We haven't provided other details on their finances prior to the acquisition because really we think the big picture here is that this deal is really about the opportunity to scale credit with our 23 million customers and less so about X1's finances prior to the deal.  Qualitatively, I'd say that their business was growing leading into the acquisition. We really liked the quality of their credit and underwriting, so we're in a good spot. And the overall economics were also improving as well.  In terms of integration, right now, we are integrating the team and we're working closely together on strategy. And Deepak is reporting directly into Vlad. So super excited about the potential here and we'll share more updates as we make progress. I think we're in a really strong place as a company. We've got over $6 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. We've got record margins this quarter, and we just reached GAAP profitability. So I'm really liking the strength of the business and the position that we're in right now.  In terms of returning value to shareholders, the traditional debate is share repurchases versus dividends. Personally, I'm more inclined to use share repurchases. And on that front, as we mentioned, we're working on purchasing the 55 million Emergent Fidelity shares and we'll share more on that as we make some progress. Devin, we did have some one-time costs on that reduction. It's included in the OpEx that we reported for Q2. And we viewed these changes as more of kind of ongoing management of costs. And so, we did not exclude them from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA this quarter.  And then in terms of kind of go forward, the effects of the forward cost savings on the reductions, as well as the additional costs of integrating X1 are all factored into the OpEx guide that we gave, and we tightened the range there and left the midpoint unchanged for the rest of the year. I'll maybe lead and then, Vlad, you can weigh in a little bit as well. So, overall, the sentiment from our customers about Robinhood is improving. We talked about improvements in NPS year-over-year last quarter, overall up 20 points year-over-year on average and up over 30 points for our more active traders, which is really encouraging. And we're continuing just to focus in on user experience and doing things like adding stock screeners and scanners as well as Robinhood's 24 hour market. So I think our investors are noticing. Vlad mentioned an increase in market share year-over-year, both in equities up 15% and options up over 20%.  And as I look at kind of deposits, customers continue to deposit their funds with Robinhood, over $4 billion in the quarter. And we continue to see strong deposits in July. And trading kind of picked up throughout the quarter. April, I think was seasonally low and then we just accelerated as the quarter progressed. And July was also good as we commented in our more formal comments.  So, overall, I would say that the work that we've been doing, improving user experience and product selection is really showing through for our customers. It's a little harder in crypto to measure market share. It's not as easy as it is with equities and options. But by our analysis, it does look like we're gaining share in the coins that we offer.  In terms of why, I'd probably point to the value proposition. We think we're the best place for retail traders to buy crypto for the coins that we offer. And also, we think we've got just a great user experience. And so, those are the two things. One of the things, Dan, that I'm really excited about is our continuing investment in Gold that really deepens the relationships with our customers. We offer them 4.9% on their cash sweep balances. And as we announced today, a 3% retirement match. And so, I think as we deepen our relationships with our customers, as we expand our product selection, you're going to naturally see engagement tick up over time. I would generally agree with you. We've been focused on reducing our costs and rationalizing the headcount. And our intention is to be lean and scrappy in the way that we grow our business and drive leverage to our business over time. And so, we've been focused on our cost per employee, as you pointed out.  One of the changes that we made earlier this year is we moved from a stock based award program that grants four year awards to a program that grants awards that vest over one year, and we think that that's a prudent way to do it.  Another thing, as we look at our employee footprint, we're very heavily concentrated in higher cost areas in the US and that represents an opportunity for us to balance out the mix of geographies that we work in as Robinhood employees. So, it's something that we're working on and I see that as an opportunity. Look, long term, what I'd tell you is that our objective is to maximize GAAP EPS and free cash flow per share. We're not giving any specific near term milestone targets there. But when I look at the cost structure of our business, it heavily skews towards fixed costs and less so towards variable costs, which if you can manage those fixed costs really effectively, as you grow your top line, you can deliver a lot of leverage to the bottom line. And so, as I think about, like, what kind of margins are possible for this business, I don't see any reason why we can't deliver the kinds of margins that you see in other financial services companies. One of the things that we were really excited about for the X1 team is just the quality of their team around underwriting. And we were really impressed with the high quality nature of their loan book. It's prime, prime plus. So really happy with that.  And in terms of their underwriting, they look at things like income and credit bureau and the normal things that you'd expect the teams to be looking at. One of the one things that is a weakness of MAUs is it's measuring engagement just for those that engaged in the month. And for more active traders, I think that there's a fairly high correlation there. But for the broader set of customers, less so. And we provided a couple quarters ago some context that MAUs for all of Q4 was 16 million and for the past six months was over 20 million. And so, it's not that they're dormant customer accounts, it's that they're just not necessarily engaging every single month. And for a lot of people, it's actually a very normal and healthy amount of engagement.  I do think, over time, as we broaden our product selection and deepen relationships with customers that you're going to see a more consistent relationship between MAUs and total funded accounts. But in the shorter term right now, we have seen those kind of move in opposite directions. MAUs, Ken, moved up a little bit in June versus May and it moved up a little bit more in July. So it appears to be stabilizing and kind of moving back up a little bit. Fully paid is 1.5 million. Cash card, offhand, it's a couple hundred thousand, I think, that are funded and about a million that have signed up. And I think the X1 acquisition really doubles down on the spending strategy. We want Robinhood to be a place to handle all of our customers' critical financial needs. And we want them to be able to spend with debit cards or credit cards really at their choice. And so, X1 and the cash card I think are a nice complement to each other. The comments I made in the prepared remarks is that we expect interest income kind of, all in, including X1, to increase sequentially in the zone of about $15 million. So, X1 was a part of that.  When I think about the geography for revenues for X1, you've got the interest income that you earn on revolving credit. That's offset by the cost of funding and presented net for interest income. You'll have some interchange revenue, but our accounting conclusion on that looks to be \u2013 that it'll be netted with the rewards costs. So, that'll be in transaction based revenue, but presented net. So, that's kind of the accounting overlay for X1.  In terms of the possibility, X1 has 80,000 cardholders at the time of the acquisition. We have 23 million customers that have a very nice credit profile. And I think, over time, we can make some strategy decisions that will make credit really broadly available to our customer set, regardless of their background. So I think there's a big opportunity, and I'm excited to see the team work against that. We're mindful of the regulatory environment in all the geographies that we operate in. What I'd say is there's a number of revenue streams that are available for us. The team is still working out the details there, but certainly sec lending and interest income. So there's a number of ways. We do in the US have a Gold offering. I think there's a good potential for this to be an attractive business on a unit economic perspective with or without payment for order flow. On options, we are seeing kind of across the industry that the take rate on options trading has been coming down. This is really reflective of the overall lower volatility in the market, and also a shift that's been seen kind of industrywide on a greater share towards ETF options. And so, for the quarter in Q2, the take rate was $0.45. That was the average for the quarter. It did come down as we progress through the quarter. And it's bounced back up in July slightly versus June to about $0.42 per contract. So, that's what we've been seeing there. And we've been keeping an eye on it. Thanks, everyone."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Koegel, Vice President of Investor Relations for Robinhood. Please go ahead.\nChris Koegel: Thank you, Liz. And thank you everyone for joining Robinhood\u2019s first quarter earnings call. With us today are CEO and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev; and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor, are described in the press release issued today, the earnings presentation on our Investor Relations website at investors.robinhood.com. Our Form 10-Q filed this afternoon and in our other SEC filings. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation.  With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks for the intro Chris. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. We had a strong quarter. I want to call out three things that I am especially proud of. First our product velocity continued to accelerate with several innovative products delivered to customers. And we\u2019re not slowing down, we\u2019re enabling 24-hour individual stock trading for customers by launching 24 Hour Market next week. Second, we\u2019re continuing to see significant growth from the new products we launched last year. And third, in the face of uncertainty in the banking sector, we\u2019re continuing to see strong net deposits and improving customer satisfaction. All of this is leading to financial results that keep getting better as we move closer to GAAP profitability. I\u2019m excited to tell you about all this. So, let's start with our business results.  In Q1 customer assets under custody were up 26% sequentially to $78 billion driven by rebounding stock and crypto valuations as well as continuing net deposits. If we look at net deposits, we saw $1.5 billion in March and $4.4 billion for all of Q1 which translates to a 29% annualized growth rate. And perhaps most importantly all of the new products and features we\u2019ve launched in the past year are continuing to drive higher customer satisfaction with Q1 net promoter scores improving more than 20 points from a year ago. Now if you look at financial results, Q1 we grew total net revenues by 16% from Q4. And by keeping our costs lean, we drove nice operating leverage in our business with adjusted EBITDA up 40% sequentially. I\u2019d also highlight that two new products I mentioned last quarter continue to accelerate. Stock lending and instant withdrawals. Each of these had Q1 annualized revenues that grew 50%, 50% above their January levels. If you combine the Q1 revenue from these two products, it\u2019s approaching the size of our equity trading business. And that\u2019s very exciting and I\u2019m incredibly proud of how well the team is executing. Now let\u2019s turn to our 2023 roadmap. Since we launched over eight years ago, Robinhood has introduced several innovations that have become industry standard today. Mobile trading, seamless digital onboarding, zero commissions and no-account minimums, and fractional shares. With these innovations, we've disrupted the US brokerage market and grown our business. We're now broadening our offering to include areas like retirement, advisory, and payments, and we're expanding outside the US. This is not only good for customers, but it also expands our addressable market. And as you know we've organized our 2023 roadmap into three areas, deepening relationships with our customers, innovating for our active traders, and launching new growth opportunities. Let me talk about how we're deepening our relationships with our more than 23 million existing customers. Our goal is to serve the entirety of our customers' critical financial needs. We started with trading investing, and more recently, we've launched spending, saving, and retirement products.  We track our progress here by looking at net deposits and ARPU. In Q1, net deposits grew at a 29% annualized growth rate, and ARPU increased to $77, the highest level since 2021. Our focus has been on helping customers save and invest their long-term money. In January, we launched Robinhood Retirement, the first IRA with a 1% match, no employer necessary. We've continued to enhance the product. Customers have already invested over half a billion dollars into their IRAs. It's great to see this early customer response. Teams' roadmap is full, and we think retirement has a ton of growth potential. We also love what we're seeing in Robinhood Gold. At the end of Q1, gold subscribers continue to increase up to 1.2 million, and Gold cash sweep balances were up to $8 billion. Our Gold yield is now 4.65%, and we're offering up to 2 million in FDIC insurance starting June 1. We see a big opportunity here to provide differentiated value to customers, and we're working hard to get the word out even more, including by launching a new marketing campaign across multiple channels. You may have seen our TV ads during the NBA playoffs. What we've seen from Gold in the past six months gives us a lot of confidence to increase our investment, and we're looking forward to unveiling some new Gold features in the coming months that provide our Gold customers even more differentiated value. Finally, we're going to deepen relationships with our customers even more by taking our first steps in advisory. Our goal is to provide a personalized advisory experience, much like what high-net-worth individuals have traditionally received from human advisors, but at a much lower price point by using technology. We believe this can help a lot of people who want access to advice, but have been deterred by the traditional 1% annual fee. We're excited to share more with you later this year. Now, let's discuss active traders. Over the past year, our work on options, including advanced charts, cash accounts, and strategy builder helped drive Q1 option contract volumes up 16% and Q1 active trader NPS up over 30 points year-over-year. We feel like we're on a good trajectory with options, and we have now turned our focus to our core equities offering. In April, we started rolling out stock screeners, a powerful research tool, with the simple and beautiful user experience our customers have come to expect from Robinhood. We really love what we've built here, and we're excited to get it into more of our customers' hands. And just ahead of this call, we announced the launch of 24 Hour Market, which will make us the first US retail brokerage to offer 24-5 trading of single-name stocks. This is an exciting upgrade to our stock trading product. It allows our customers to better manage their risk and take advantage of opportunities no matter what time of day they arise. We're starting with over 40 well-known stocks and ETFs and plan to expand from there. And as we look ahead, we're also working to add a broader selection of assets to Robinhood. In March, we applied for a Futures Commission Merchant License. Pending regulatory approval, we hope to launch futures trading around the end of this year. There's so much more to build for our active traders, and we're excited to continue to innovate for them. The third part of our 2023 roadmap is exploring new growth opportunities to broaden the scope and geographical reach of our products so we can add more customers and increase our revenues over time. In Q1, we rolled out our non-custodial Robinhood wallet, which customers have downloaded in over 130 countries around the world. Customers love having total control of their crypto and NFTs, as well as the no gas fees for coin swaps on the Polygon chain. There's a lot more to build here, and we're encouraged by the early user feedback. As we brought Robinhood Wallet to market, we found that one of the biggest problems was that the fiat to crypto on-ramp solutions available in market were too cumbersome and expensive to use. So, we built our own that we're calling Robinhood Connect, and it leverages the multiple payment rails and robust trading infrastructure we've developed at Robinhood. Two weeks ago at Consensus, our Crypto GM, Johann Kerbrat, announced that we're offering Robinhood Connect to third party developers. We're pleased by the early response we've seen and believe we're well positioned to take market share versus early entrants. Finally, we're making progress towards our ambitious goal of launching brokerage operations in the UK by the end of the year. We have an existing license in place, a brand that resonates, and experienced leaders running the effort. So, we're excited to launch and start driving innovation in the UK market like we've done in the US over the past eight years. We're really excited about the roadmap ahead of us, and there's so much to do. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Warnick : Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. In the first quarter, we stayed focused on serving customers, growing our business, and driving long-term shareholder value. Our team continued to execute on our product roadmap, scale products we launched over the past year, and drive adjusted EBITDA higher. As I look back over the past year, I'm incredibly proud of how our team executed to transform the financial profile of our business. While a year ago, we had our lowest quarter of adjusted EBITDA, in Q1, we matched our all-time high. We grew revenues for four quarters in a row while getting to a leaner operating model. As a result, our Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $115 million is up over $250 million from a year ago. On an annualized run rate basis, that's an increase of more than $1 billion. And our Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin of 26% was an all-time high. And we aren't stopping here. We are committed to becoming profitable on a GAAP basis, and we're making good progress on that front.  Looking at our Q1 GAAP results, EPS was negative $0.57. This included a one-time non-cash charge from our founders who canceled their 2021 equity awards that significantly reduces our SBC quarterly run rate going forward. EPS, prior to the 2021 founder award cancellation, was negative $0.03, so we're getting much closer to GAAP profitability. Now let's look at our first quarter business results. Customer assets under custody increased 26% sequentially in Q1 to $78 billion as growth stock and crypto valuations rebounded and customers continued to deposit money into Robinhood. Looking at net deposits, they were $4.4 billion in Q1, which translates to a 29% annualized growth rate relative to Q4 AUC. These resilient customer net deposits position us really well for continued asset growth as markets rise over time. Turning to net-funded accounts, which represent unique users on our platform, they increased by 120,000 in Q1 to 23.1 million. Additionally, we now have over 250,000 retirement accounts that already have an average balance of over $2,000. The vast majority of these retirement accounts were funded by existing customers who are significantly increasing their average AUC at Robinhood by making these IRA contributions. We're continuing to work on new disclosures to highlight progress like this as we deepen our relationships with customers. As for monthly active users, they were 11.8 million at the end of Q1, up from 11.4 million a quarter ago. Now let's review Q1 revenues. Total net revenues were $441 million, a 16% increase from Q4 as transaction and net interest revenues increased during the quarter. Q1 ARPU was $77, up from $66 last quarter and the highest level since 2021. Transaction-based revenues were $207 million in Q1, up 11% sequentially. Equity and options volumes picked up from Q4, and crypto volumes were in line with Q4. Moving to net interest revenues, they were $208 million in Q1, up 25% sequentially. The increase was driven by higher securities lending activity, cash suite balances, and short-term interest rates versus Q4 levels, partially offset by lower average margin balances. Q1 interest earning assets were $22 billion, 21%, or $4 billion sequentially, primarily driven by Gold customers continuing to bring more deposits to Robinhood. Looking ahead, we anticipate Q2 net interest revenues will be up roughly $15 million from Q1. This outlook assumes the Q1 level of securities lending revenue and today's levels of balances, deposit rates, and Fed fund rates. Of course, our Q2 results could be higher or lower depending on how the quarter plays out. Moving on to other revenues, they were $26 million in Q1, roughly flat from Q4. Gold subscribers increased for the second quarter in a row to $1.2 million, up about $40,000 sequentially. We love that more customers are benefiting from gold, and this is also good news for our revenues. Gold subscribers have ARPU that is multiples of our average customer, as they bring more assets and use more of our services. This is also true for newer cohorts that joined to take advantage of our high-yield offer. This gives us a lot of confidence to keep investing in the Gold value proposition. Moving ahead, as Q2 is proxy season, which drives a seasonal increase in other revenue, and our Say Technologies team is managing Robinhood's proxy services this year. Because of this, we continue to expect a sequential increase of around $30 million for other revenues in Q2, with Q3 returning to roughly Q1 levels. I also wanted to note that with April being tax month, it's typical across the brokerage industry to see lower net deposits and trading.  For us, it was great to see customers add another $1.4 billion of net deposits in April, in line with our Q1 average. This drove cash suite balances to a new high of $10 billion earlier this week. For MAUs, they declined about 3% in April, and for trading, while options and equities were off 17% and 27%, respectively, versus the Q1 monthly average, crypto volumes were in line with Q1. We hope this color is helpful ahead of providing our monthly metrics next week. Now let's review Q1 expenses. At a high level, we really like the operating leverage we're generating as we stay disciplined on expenses. One measure we track is annualized revenue per employee. In Q1, it was $760,000, which is more than double from a year ago. It was also great to see Q1 adjusted EBITDA grow 40% from Q4, more than twice as fast as total net revenue growth. Looking more closely at our costs, let's first review OPEX prior to SBC. It was $352 million in Q1, slightly below the lower end of our full year 2023 outlook range. Looking forward, there's no change to our full year outlook. We continue to expect 2023 OPEX prior to SBC to be in the range of $1.42 billion to $1.48 billion. And as a reminder, our annual employee merit increases were in March, so you'll see that full effect in Q2. Turning to SBC, it was $598 million in Q1, which included the one-time $485 million non-cash charge from the founder award cancellation. This Q1 result was about $30 million better than our previous first quarter outlook. We're flowing this through into our full year 2023 SBC outlook to improve it to $925 million to $1.005 billion. I also wanted to highlight that over the long term, we think it's important to manage share-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to lower levels. In Q1, apart from the founder award cancellation, SBC was 26% of total revenues, down significantly from a year ago. And as we look ahead, we're working to lower that percentage more over time. Now turning to capital management. In Q1, our balance sheet remained strong with about $6 billion of corporate cash and investments. This includes about $500 million that we moved in Q1 from cash into a laddered portfolio of treasuries and other high-quality assets with an average duration of less than a year. As for capital deployment, I wanted to briefly note that we are making some progress on discussions to purchase most or all of the 55 million Robinhood shares that were acquired last summer by Emergent Fidelity Technologies. We don't have any specifics to share yet, but we look forward to providing updates when we can. In closing, I'm really pleased with the financial progress we've made over the past year while continuing to deliver new capabilities and enhancing customer experience. Q1 was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, and we continue to focus on driving profitable growth over time. With that, Chris, let's move to Q&A.\nA - Chris Koegel: Thank you, Jason. For the Q&A session, we'll start by answering shareholder questions from Say Technologies. These are ranked by number of votes. We'll pass over any questions that were already answered on the call or in prior quarters. We'll also group together questions that share a common theme. After that, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So, I'll kick it off with our first question from Say. This one's for Jason. So, two questions we're combining here. The first is, Siraj P. asks, what is the plan to be a profitable company? And Gregory P. asks, what are the primary ways management plans to return value to shareholders in 2023?\nJason Warnick: Great. Thanks for the questions. We're really focused on three things to drive shareholder value. First, we want to keep launching new products and improve upon our existing products. We've made a lot of momentum here and our product velocity is fast as we've seen it so far as a company.  So, we feel really good about that. The second is, is we want to drive profitable growth. And we're going to keep our costs lean and find ways to drive even more efficiency over time. This quarter, it was nice to see our adjusted EBITDA grow at twice the rate of our revenue growth. And we're working on driving leverage in our business even more over time. And then lastly, what I'd say is we want to efficiently deploy our capital. This would include how we deploy capital for organic growth opportunities, for possible M&A growth. And as well, over time, could include returning some capital to shareholders. And I think if we do these three things really well over time, it should create a lot of shareholder value.  In terms of reaching profitable growth, I don't want to predict any particular timeline on that. But we are getting really close. Excluding the founder award cancellation our EPS was minus $0.03 per share. So, we're going to keep focusing on rolling out new products and keeping our costs lean. And we should get there over time. Thanks for the question.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Jason. Next question is also for you. Philip S. asks, what does Robinhood's financial position look like after all the recent regional bank failures? What does Robinhood do to ensure that it doesn't find itself in the same position as those from SVB, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank? And a similar question comes from [Messer] (ph). With so many banks going under, what is the Robinhood exposure?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, thanks for these questions. First, I think it's really important to clarify that Robinhood is not a bank. We keep our customer cash liquid, and we don't have the risk of asset liability mismatch that banks have to manage. Also, it's great to see that our customers continue to deposit funds with us. Gold cash suite balances were up 67% from last quarter, up to $8 billion. And in March, when all the banking turbulence happened, our customers deposited $1.5 billion with us. So, we think we're in a really good position, and particularly as customers respond to our great offerings for Gold members. So, thanks for the question.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Jason. The next question is for Vlad. It's from Edward O., who asks, any plans to add custodial accounts to allow parents to teach their children about investing?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, in short, absolutely. This is part of our longer-term roadmap. And we recently launched retirement, as you're probably aware. And we now have hundreds of thousands of customers that have multiple accounts with us. So, with retirement, it was really the first time that a customer could open multiple brokerage accounts within our product. And it took a lot of work to build the infrastructure for that and build the product affordances necessary. So now it's much easier for us to add different account types. And we hear from customers. They want to teach their children about investing. They also are interested in joint accounts and would like to collaborate with their finances and manage them with their partner. So, these things are definitely part of the longer-term roadmap. We want to make sure we continue deepening relationships with our customers, as we've been doing with the launch of retirement. Keen to do it. No specific timeline to share, but stay tuned.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Vlad. The next question is also from Edward O., who asks, Robinhood launched IRAs about six months ago. How has adoption been? How does it compare to leadership expectations? And are retirement accounts a key part of Robinhood strategy going forward?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, we're really pleased with the contributions we've seen so far, over half a billion in assets, leading to $5 million in matches to customers. And we're seeing customers continuing to bring more of their cash onto the platform. The feedback that we're hearing has been really good as well. Customers love the match. They also love the fact that we're providing recommendations. And the recommendations are now being used by two-thirds of customers that onboard onto retirement. And we're excited about that, especially when we think about what that means for the future of advisory and providing personalized ongoing advice to our customers to help them manage their investments.\nJason Warnick: One thing that I'd add is if you look at total accounts that we added this year between brokerage and retirement, it was about the same number of total accounts that we opened in all of last year. So, it's really nice to see this kind of acceleration and new account growth.\nChris Koegel: Right. Thank you, Vlad. Thank you, Jason. The next question is for Jason, and Richard S. asks, can Robinhood shareholders have free access to Gold?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, thanks for the question. And thanks for letting me answer this one instead of Vlad. Want to make Gold the best deal in financial services, we think it's a great deal at $5 per month, just a great value overall, we're going to keep investing in the product to make it even better. And for now, we don't have any plans to give it away for free.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Jason. Next questions is for Vlad. And it's from Sujan T. Who asks, on the last call, it was mentioned that Robinhood was looking into adding an advisory program to their services. What will this look like? And are there plans to work with a seasoned wealth management company or will it be kept in house?\nVlad Tenev: Hi, Sujan, yes, we mentioned it on the last call. And we are getting very excited about what we can do in advisory. We've hired some great people, in particular, our Head of Investment Strategy, Steph Guild, who's an industry vet, with 20 years of experience at large financial institutions. You might have seen, she's got a weekly column where she talks about the markets. That's quite good. And we really think that in Robinhood, we can build the expertise necessary to give our customers amazing advice. And we've got teams hard at work building a great advisory product. And we believe that we can deliver that to customers, using the teams we have in house. So, more to come, obviously, as the work progresses, but we think we can we can build something really great for customers here.\nChris Koegel: Awesome. Thanks, Vlad. The next question is also for you. G. C. asks, is Robinhood exploring ways to leverage AI into its services?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I think that over the next few decades, every company will have to transform into an AI company. Looking at the past 20 years, and how sort of the companies that have been able to move ahead and create differentiated value, have been technology companies, in the same way that every company sort of has needed to become a technology company. I think AI will sort of be embedded into the fabric of all companies. And that's how we're thinking about it. Robinhood has always been early to adopt new technologies like data science and machine learning, both to lower our costs and deliver product experiences and value for our customers. And we're really excited to continue to embed AI as a tool, both internally and helping us ship products even faster, and incorporating into existing products and new products. So, we think that the impact of AI and other tools that we've seen thus far is going to be extraordinary.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. The next question is also for you. It's from Justin P. who asks, when will Robinhood support an official trading API for creating trade automation like other brokers?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, this is something we're excited about. And we hear from our active traders about but we don't offer it today. If you look at Robinhood Connect, which we announced and started rolling out recently, that leverages some of the trading infrastructure on our crypto side for a developer and B2B targeted product. Making it easier for our active traders and innovating for them is top of mind. So, this is definitely something we would look to offer over time. So, stay tuned.\nChris Koegel: All right. Next question is also for you, Vlad. Tarun G asks, there's a perception that Robinhood is not as safe as other older brokerage firms like Fidelity and Schwab, Robinhood doing anything to change this perception.\nVlad Tenev: At Robinhood safety is our top company value. And when I think about what that means, several things come to mind. First is great customer support. And we made tremendous progress over the past few years, adding more channels improving the quality of customer support overall and making it much better and the progress there continues. The second thing is making sure that our app in our infrastructure is reliable and available to customers when they need us the most and we made tremendous progress there to -- the third is the safety of customers assets within Robinhood. And as we announced earlier in the call with Robinhood, Gold, we're offering a 4.65% APY on customer uninvested cash. And we're also offering 2 million of FDIC insurance starting June 1st. So, your money is going to have higher insurance in Robinhood, Gold and in our cash sweep than you would get at a typical bank. I should also mention, as with every brokerage account, your brokerage assets are SIPC insured, and we also have access to big coverage. So, what does this what does this mean? When we look at kind of how customers are engaging with the service, we're seeing higher NPS indicative of increasing customer trust. And the results speak for themselves, customers are continuing to trust us with their deposits. When we see a lot of institutions in the banking sector and elsewhere are seeing outflows in this quarter, we're continuing to see strong inflows with 1.4 billion in net deposits and 4.4 billion and in Q1. So, we feel really, really good about customers increasingly trusting us.\nChris Koegel: Alright, last question from Say, and this is from -- for Vlad, it's [indiscernible] asks, How is Robinhood better or different from other platforms? What moves will Robinhood be making to become the top trading platform?\nVlad Tenev: Well, in my opinion, we are the most innovative trading platform in the marketplace. We've introduced several new industry innovations that have become norms, not just zero commission, no account minimum trading, but also recently retirement with a 1% embedded match, which we're very excited about. And with the announcement of 24/5 trading, we're leading the industry once again. So, we're going to continue to focus on our customers. We're going to make progress, launching products in a way that emphasizes customer safety. But we're going to continue to innovate. And I'm very, very excited about the things that we're launching and we have launched in the past few months.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. Thank you, Jason. And that concludes our shareholder questions from Say Technologies. We really do appreciate all our shareholders taking time to asking these questions to Vlad and Jason. We're looking forward to more next quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Liz to lead Q&A from our analysts.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.\nRich Repetto : Yeah, good evening, Vlad. Good evening, Jason. And congrats on the improved profitability of the quarter and great disclosures, too. So, my question is Vlad and Jason is on the net interest income, it improved 25%. Quarter-over-quarter. And, Jason, I know you talked about a $20 million increase. But this turned out to be 41 million. And I guess I'm trying to see what surprised you. I can see the fully paid securities lending was a little bit better. But what surprised you that give you that bump up and NII quarter-over-quarter?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, thanks for the question. Rich, and we were pleased to see that the pickup in NII. I mean, there's a few things that I call out you highlighted, securities lending, you'll recall that last quarter, was a particularly soft quarter for sec lending. And at the time of the call, we were cautious in the way that we were evaluating the outlook for Q1. And the activity for sec lending in Q1 was strong and in addition to the strength of just the activity, which increased the rebates as well as the interest we earn on collateral. We also saw rebate rates tick up meaningfully in the quarter and so this led to some outperformance. We also saw strength in customer deposits. And also, the flow through of interest rate on those incremental deposits beyond kind of what we were anticipating. So, overall, really pleased it was higher than we expected. And we were pleased with that.\nRich Repetto : Got it. And my follow-up will be on sort of the product innovation side Vlad and you talked a lot about advisory and hiring a new person but I would expect when you talk, that Robinhood could do with technology driven I would expect. So, any color is it going to be more of a robo advisor, type platform or any insight into what the product will look like?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, I don't want to share too much. But what I'll tell you is we want to go beyond just being a robo advisor. And we really want to use technology to give personalized advice at scale, much like what a high-net-worth individual would come to expect from a financial advisor that they'd be paying 1%, 1% AUM advisory fee for and Robinhood can build a great experience for that. That's mobile first. And of course, we'll plan to use every technology that that we think is going to be useful in the market to make that happen and deliver it in a scalable way.\nRich Repetto : Thank you guys. Very helpful.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho?\nDan Dolev: Hi, guys, excellent results. Maybe if I missed it but on mix by the depo trends and FDA? Can you give us a sense of, what is going on? Is this seasonal? Or how should we interpret it? And then \u2013 etcetera?\nJason Warnick: April thank you. Yeah, the connection is a little poor Dan, but I think we got your question. So, April, as is tax months. And, across the industry, you tend to see customer dollars flowing, flowing for taxes and less in trading and engagement in deposits. We actually had a really strong April from a deposits perspective. 1.4 million coming in, the trading was softer than what we saw in Q1. That's normal. It's expected. We saw it last year. And as we look across industry results, it's pretty much in line with what others are seeing as well.\nDan Dolev: Perfect, a really quick follow-up. Coinbase said that they raised prices for small ticket items on crypto. Have you seen any of that on your platform? Thank you and great results.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, we've kept the rebates on our crypto offering the same. And, we've been pleased by the market share that we have in the retail US crypto offering, we want to make sure that we offer great pricing to customers. And we think that over time, keeping the pricing very competitive is going to lead to increase market share gains over time. So, it's really, we want to make sure our pricing is awesome. And the user experience continues to be great for the crypto offerings. And we think that it's got a bright future, and we see potential to grow our market share there.\nDan Dolev: Great, excellent stuff. Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Markgraff with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAlex Markgraff: Hey, everyone, thank you for taking the question. Just maybe a couple first on Robinhood. Connect, just kind of curious how you see this product scaling, just considering kind of the external nature of the product? And then any comments on monetization of Connect would be helpful.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, absolutely, I can feel that one. So, really Robinhood Connect is an on ramp for third party developers to integrate Fiat to crypto into their apps. And we see a big opportunity for us in this space, because the infrastructure that we've developed for the Robinhood App and the Robinhood Wallet to not just move money into the platform but also integrate with various trading partners and get great trade execution allows us to offer not just great customer experience to developers, but great pricing. So, as we look at kind of the space, we see that other on ramps don't have great funding options. They either offer only card, or some of them that offer bank linking are just prohibitively expensive. And in general, the costs are quite high, like north of 5% per transaction. And so, we see an opportunity to take what we built on the consumer side and really offer a differentiated product for customers. In terms of monetization, we believe that we can offer the product at lower prices and still monetize with taking a percentage of every transaction and earn healthy margins for the business over time.\nAlex Markgraff: That's great, thank you. And then just around 24/5 trading, just kind of curious, any thoughts in terms of what sort of engagement uplift you might expect or anticipate around that? Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, it's very hard to predict what's going to happen with 24/5 trading. It's fundamentally new in the market, and Robinhood is going to be the first retail broker in the US to offer this for individual names. I think that what we'd like to see is sort of good liquidity available for these symbols, and liquidity to be a little bit smoother, and not as much happening on the open and the close. And I think that would be really, really interesting for the markets. In terms of engagement. We have seen with hyper extended hours, which we launched last year that we saw increased volumes, but I think it's probably a little bit early to, to give estimates for, for what we'd see in terms of volumes there.\nAlex Markgraff: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Hi, Vlad. Hi, Jason, how are you?\nVlad Tenev: Hey, Devin, how are you doing?\nDevin Ryan: Doing great. Start with one for Jason on just the corporate cash. So, obviously the firm continues to sit on a lot of cash and liquidity here. Adjusted EBITDA\u2019s now you're very solidly positive. So, it seemed like you're in improving position to play offense and so appreciate you're looking into repurchasing the shares from emerging technologies as one use, but just love to maybe talk about or get an update on what the other top priorities are. And then on the M&A front, the type of opportunities that you're seeing in the market today. And Jason, if you can just remind us on those financial hurdles that you need, and maybe how that\u2019s interplayed with some of the recent deals that you've done for context?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, thanks, Devin. Great, question. So first of all, in this market backdrop, I do like having a really strong balance sheet. And as you mentioned, $6 billion in cash and investments, given this market backdrop, I think has been a source of strength for us. I like that. But it's not an ideal capital structure.  And over time, I think you'll see us continue to work on that, to be even more efficient. My mind goes to the M&A front when I think about use of capital, beyond just running our business. And I'd say that the environments becoming more constructive, the bid ask spread has been incredibly wide, as public markets corrected, and I think private markets are a bit slow to face that reality. And I think it's been more constructive now. And it's up to us to look at opportunities. You talked about hurdle rates, it's looking at things like what's the return on invested capital? Will it be accretive to our business? And then in terms of the business itself? Is it going to accelerate our roadmap and does the team that we acquire, share the values that we have around a culture around safety and compliance, as well as an obsession for customer experience? So, these are all the things that we are looking at. And like I said, I'd say that the backdrop is improving there.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, great color, thank you. Just a follow-up here want to dig in a little bit on the futures offering, and just to get a sense of what the timeline is going to look like to get into that business. And then, in terms of, the target audience here, how much demand are you seeing from your existing customers for this product? Or is this is more about kind of accelerating the push with active traders and just sizing the opportunity? Could this actually be more than 10% of darts over time, we've seen what it is for some others, but just love to get a sense of the addressable market for you. Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: I'd be happy to feel that one. We're very excited about launching futures trading to our customers. And, as I mentioned in the call, the goal is to launch at around the end of this year pending, of course, regulatory approvals. On our application. I think as we think about it, we see two opportunities. One is making a really great product for our active traders. As we've talked about a little bit over the past few quarters, active traders have been an increasing area of focus for us. We've been able to drive Active Trader NPS significantly higher in the past year. We love that our active traders are feeling the love and seeing improvements in the customer experience for the product. And we think that futures trading is an innovative new asset that allow them to manage their risk and in new ways. The second thing that we think we have an opportunity to do is if you look at what we've done with fractional shares, and options, trading Robinhood, historically brought new investors to the market who haven't been investing and haven't had access to these products in the past.  With futures trading, we see a lot of complexity in the existing products and interfaces, which I think makes them less accessible. So, one thing we'd like to do is just simplify that and make that really, really useful and easy to use in mobile. And we think that there's a lot of whitespace ahead of us there. And I want to give a special shout out to JB Mckenzie, who joined as the GM of our futures business. And I know that he's very, very excited to launch this as quickly as possible. And maybe this question provides a little bit extra motivation, not that he needs that.\nDevin Ryan: Exactly. Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate, Vlad.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Great day. Good afternoon, and great to see the progress inching towards GAAP profitability here. So, the question is, how do you think about sustaining GAAP profitability once you've crossed there, you've benefited from interest rates haven't gone higher. So, if the Fed were to cut, how do you think that impacting revenues at this point, and which products and revenue pools do you think have the most compelling profitable growth over the next 12 to 24 months?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, thanks, Mike. It's Jason I\u2019ll start. And we'll see if Vlad wants to add any color, in terms of reaching and ultimately sustaining GAAP profitability. There's a couple of elements that are really important. The first is continuing to improve our user experience on our existing products, expand the service capability of existing products, and then also keep rolling out new products for customers. And we're seeing a lot of traction here, our product velocity is only getting faster, and customers are really responding, we're seeing that in our NPS score being up over 20 points, overall, and up over 30 points for our most active customers. So really, really encouraging signals. To your point, our revenue is diversifying interest income is becoming a larger portion of that things like securities lending is also contributing but also interest on cash as well. When we think about the dynamic between, rising rates and falling rates and the effect on revenue, there's a couple things that I point out first, there is a bit of a natural offset between changes in interest rates and demand for equities or trading activity. And so, while it's not a perfect correlation, they do tend to move in opposite directions. And we think that's, good for the balance of our business. I'd also say that as we continue to roll out new products that that's just going to further diversify and really strengthen the revenue profile, of our business. The last thing we're looking at, and I mentioned it last quarter, is we are evaluating whether we want to use any kind of hedging for significant rate drops, to manage our sensitivity to interest rates, we've been looking at whether, option floor strategy, for example, that could be a way to maintain liquidity, do it at a modest cost, and not introduce any P&L variability. We haven't made a decision there yet. But it's something that we're continuing to look at.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, the only thing I'd add is just that I think the team has done a fantastic job over the past year, diversifying our business, so that, we can be sustainable in a high interest rate environment. I think, before the fear that we were getting from analysts and the community was doing great in a low interest rate environment, but what if rates tick up? How will you do then, and I think we've shown that this is a resilient business, the team moves fast and innovates. And we're really pleased with how diversified the business has become, and we see opportunities to keep pulling on that and do it even further.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thanks. Just a follow up question on the crypto, the regulatory environment in the US continues to tighten around cryptos just curious, your perspectives there on the regulatory landscape. What steps are you taking to protect Robinhood and what risks if any do you see?\nJason Warnick : Yeah, so the crypto environment has, faced, increasing regulatory scrutiny. The things that I'd point out is that, we've been a safety first company, for a long time, it's been a core value. In fact, it's our top company value and Vlad talked about it on these calls in the past. What this has meant is that, we've been very deliberate in the way that we expand our coin offering, we've got a rigorous coin framework, and we're very careful in the way that we evaluate those points. I'd say if you if you compare Robinhood to perhaps others, across the industry, we consistently demonstrate that we have respect for the securities regulations of the country. And, and this has led to us making tough decisions on product selection, don't offer staking, that's something that's been under scrutiny as well. And so, we'll continue to operate with that mindset. We want to be on the right side of these decisions at the same time we want to innovate for customers. And I think additional regulatory clarity would be super helpful on that front. \nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you.\nJason Warnick : Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Will Nance with Goldman Sachs.\nWill Nance: Good evening. I wanted to follow up on the earlier question on the securities lending as it sounds like fully paid adoption was partial driver there, that sounds like that's, you're baking in consistent securities lending revenue in the current quarter, when I look at the fully paid versus margin fully paid, definitely more than margin sequentially, but even the base level of margin, I think, was up 70% sequentially.  So, I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about, how much of this was sort of environmental to the demand? And what kind of rates you are able to get on that, and how much of this, you think is maybe just talk about the sustainability in the current macro environment, particularly in light of some of the reduced engagement levels that we've seen that you're kind of referencing in the month of April?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, and I'd say that, thanks for your question Will. I'd say that the securities lending business is less beholding to monthly engagement metrics. It's based more on how many of our customers have opted in whether or not they're engaging on a monthly on a monthly basis with us. We've seen overall strength in the market for securities lending this quarter, I'd say Q4 was unusually soft, it was one of the softest quarters that I've seen in the years that I've been here. But there was a strong backdrop. In Q1 that continues here into Q2. So, demand was higher, it allowed us with the backdrop of adding more customers to the fully paid securities program. Securities lending program to be able to lend out even more help our customers, optimize their own yield by participating. And the rebates that we saw were particularly strong, so far, in Q2, we continue to see, levels, consistent with what we were seeing in Q1.\nWill Nance: Got it. That's super helpful. And just maybe a detailed model like question on the options take rate, it seems like that's been coming down a little bit over the past several quarters, and came in a little bit lower than what we were looking forward to, just wondering if you could talk about drivers of that seems like it's been more on the rebate side and less on the actual volume?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, sure. So, the take rate is really just an effect of mix. So, no change in the pricing structure, but the tier that includes spy contracts has just been increasing as an overall percentage in this market backdrop, and that's shown up in a reduced blended rate.\nWill Nance: Got it? Appreciate you taking the questions.\nJason Warnick: You bet. Thanks, Will.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.\nKen Worthington : Hi good evening, and thanks for taking the question. Can you give us an update on the new cash card? What has been the uptake on the new card? And any color on what transaction activity looks like there?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, sure. I mean, the cash card, is off to a good start. I'd say it's really early Ken. And, the uptake, is a few 100, a couple 100,000 customers. And what we're really working on is continuing to iterate on the value proposition. We want that card to be kind of top of wallet, and we're not there yet. So, the team is hard at work. We're talking to customers, we're evaluating the value proposition. I think longer term, this has potential to be, a meaningful, engagement driver for us and will help us deepen our relationships. But we're not there yet, but it's early.\nKen Worthington : Thank you. And then maybe following up on options, trading there continues to represent the majority of transaction revenue for Robinhood. We've seen index options, trading dominate certain parts of retail, particularly zero day options. Any color, you can give us some what portion either index options are, or if zero day options has been a driver of some of the growth that you've seen. And then maybe just to help size, size options for us, you had 23.1 million accounts, and a use of 11.8. What portion of your customers are trading options for you, in this quarter, over the last year? Thanks.\nJason Warnick: Sure, Ken I\u2019ll start and we'll see if Vlad adds any colors. So, first, I'd say hundreds of thousands is the order of magnitude on options traders. So, a relatively small portion of our customers are engaged in in options trading every month. In terms of zero day options. We don't currently offer those. It's something that we do hear from customers that they're interested in -- \nVlad Tenev: But we don't offer cash settled index options. We don't offer cash settled index options. We have zero day, but their ETF yet, ETF options traded on the platform.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. And so in terms of expanding that to cash settled, it's something that we\u2019ll evaluate over time.\nKen Worthington : Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew O'Neill with FT Partners.\nMatthew O'Neill: Yeah. Hi, thank you so much for taking my question. I just wanted to confirm the April. One of one of the April trends, I believe it was mentioned that the MA use were down after it was, nice to see them increase -- about the trend this past quarter. Anything to sort of take into account that I know there's a lot of discussions already on some of the April dynamics with tax season and so forth. Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, thanks for the question. So, yeah, we saw MA use go from 11.8 to 11.4 in April. And really what I\u2019d pointed, it's in the zone of where we were, sorry, 11.5. It's in the zone of where we were in in Q1, it's nice to see that it's kind of stabilized. And I just point to the seasonal dynamics of April that I referred to earlier in my comments.\nMatthew O'Neill: Under understood, thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark McLaughlin, with Bank of America.\nMark McLaughlin: He guys, thanks for taking my question. I had for the first one. I was curious, what was the decision behind the reallocation of, I assume cash to held to maturity securities? Because I know you guys had mentioned earlier, you're not taking on a lot of duration risk. So, I just wanted to know the accounting reason behind that?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, it's more. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, in the broader context, we've got $6 billion of cash on our balance sheet, and it just was good hygiene for us to take a small portion of that, and extend the duration of it. So, it's held to maturity, it's, it's a laddered portfolio that's rolling. So, it's highly liquid. And that was the logic behind it. Just looking at the fair value, it's right on what the purchase price was of the portfolio.\nMark McLaughlin: Awesome. Thank you. And then for a quick follow-up. I know in quarters past, you guys have kind of talked about expansion, especially starting in the UK. Not obviously trying to monetize client cash balances with a bank charter helps when moving abroad, makes things a lot less complicated. Any updates on international expansion or how are you guys thinking about that going forward? \nVlad Tenev: Yeah, we're making progress towards the goal of launching brokerage in the UK by the end of the year. As I mentioned in the past, we've got an existing license in place. We think that our brand is very strong and will resonate very well in the UK and experienced leaders running the effort. So, stay tuned, but we're excited to make it happen.\nMark McLaughlin: Awesome, thanks, guys.\nVlad Tenev: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Vlad Tenev for closing remarks.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, thank you guys so much for listening and asking questions. So, we're very excited by the progress. And check out 24 hour market very excited for that to be launching next week.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thanks for the intro Chris. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. We had a strong quarter. I want to call out three things that I am especially proud of. First our product velocity continued to accelerate with several innovative products delivered to customers. And we're not slowing down, we're enabling 24-hour individual stock trading for customers by launching 24 Hour Market next week. Second, we're continuing to see significant growth from the new products we launched last year. And third, in the face of uncertainty in the banking sector, we're continuing to see strong net deposits and improving customer satisfaction. All of this is leading to financial results that keep getting better as we move closer to GAAP profitability. I'm excited to tell you about all this. So, let's start with our business results.  In Q1 customer assets under custody were up 26% sequentially to $78 billion driven by rebounding stock and crypto valuations as well as continuing net deposits. If we look at net deposits, we saw $1.5 billion in March and $4.4 billion for all of Q1 which translates to a 29% annualized growth rate. And perhaps most importantly all of the new products and features we've launched in the past year are continuing to drive higher customer satisfaction with Q1 net promoter scores improving more than 20 points from a year ago. Now if you look at financial results, Q1 we grew total net revenues by 16% from Q4. And by keeping our costs lean, we drove nice operating leverage in our business with adjusted EBITDA up 40% sequentially. I'd also highlight that two new products I mentioned last quarter continue to accelerate. Stock lending and instant withdrawals. Each of these had Q1 annualized revenues that grew 50%, 50% above their January levels. If you combine the Q1 revenue from these two products, it's approaching the size of our equity trading business. And that's very exciting and I'm incredibly proud of how well the team is executing. Now let's turn to our 2023 roadmap. Since we launched over eight years ago, Robinhood has introduced several innovations that have become industry standard today. Mobile trading, seamless digital onboarding, zero commissions and no-account minimums, and fractional shares. With these innovations, we've disrupted the US brokerage market and grown our business. We're now broadening our offering to include areas like retirement, advisory, and payments, and we're expanding outside the US. This is not only good for customers, but it also expands our addressable market. And as you know we've organized our 2023 roadmap into three areas, deepening relationships with our customers, innovating for our active traders, and launching new growth opportunities. Let me talk about how we're deepening our relationships with our more than 23 million existing customers. Our goal is to serve the entirety of our customers' critical financial needs. We started with trading investing, and more recently, we've launched spending, saving, and retirement products.  We track our progress here by looking at net deposits and ARPU. In Q1, net deposits grew at a 29% annualized growth rate, and ARPU increased to $77, the highest level since 2021. Our focus has been on helping customers save and invest their long-term money. In January, we launched Robinhood Retirement, the first IRA with a 1% match, no employer necessary. We've continued to enhance the product. Customers have already invested over half a billion dollars into their IRAs. It's great to see this early customer response. Teams' roadmap is full, and we think retirement has a ton of growth potential. We also love what we're seeing in Robinhood Gold. At the end of Q1, gold subscribers continue to increase up to 1.2 million, and Gold cash sweep balances were up to $8 billion. Our Gold yield is now 4.65%, and we're offering up to 2 million in FDIC insurance starting June 1. We see a big opportunity here to provide differentiated value to customers, and we're working hard to get the word out even more, including by launching a new marketing campaign across multiple channels. You may have seen our TV ads during the NBA playoffs. What we've seen from Gold in the past six months gives us a lot of confidence to increase our investment, and we're looking forward to unveiling some new Gold features in the coming months that provide our Gold customers even more differentiated value. Finally, we're going to deepen relationships with our customers even more by taking our first steps in advisory. Our goal is to provide a personalized advisory experience, much like what high-net-worth individuals have traditionally received from human advisors, but at a much lower price point by using technology. We believe this can help a lot of people who want access to advice, but have been deterred by the traditional 1% annual fee. We're excited to share more with you later this year. Now, let's discuss active traders. Over the past year, our work on options, including advanced charts, cash accounts, and strategy builder helped drive Q1 option contract volumes up 16% and Q1 active trader NPS up over 30 points year-over-year. We feel like we're on a good trajectory with options, and we have now turned our focus to our core equities offering. In April, we started rolling out stock screeners, a powerful research tool, with the simple and beautiful user experience our customers have come to expect from Robinhood. We really love what we've built here, and we're excited to get it into more of our customers' hands. And just ahead of this call, we announced the launch of 24 Hour Market, which will make us the first US retail brokerage to offer 24-5 trading of single-name stocks. This is an exciting upgrade to our stock trading product. It allows our customers to better manage their risk and take advantage of opportunities no matter what time of day they arise. We're starting with over 40 well-known stocks and ETFs and plan to expand from there. And as we look ahead, we're also working to add a broader selection of assets to Robinhood. In March, we applied for a Futures Commission Merchant License. Pending regulatory approval, we hope to launch futures trading around the end of this year. There's so much more to build for our active traders, and we're excited to continue to innovate for them. The third part of our 2023 roadmap is exploring new growth opportunities to broaden the scope and geographical reach of our products so we can add more customers and increase our revenues over time. In Q1, we rolled out our non-custodial Robinhood wallet, which customers have downloaded in over 130 countries around the world. Customers love having total control of their crypto and NFTs, as well as the no gas fees for coin swaps on the Polygon chain. There's a lot more to build here, and we're encouraged by the early user feedback. As we brought Robinhood Wallet to market, we found that one of the biggest problems was that the fiat to crypto on-ramp solutions available in market were too cumbersome and expensive to use. So, we built our own that we're calling Robinhood Connect, and it leverages the multiple payment rails and robust trading infrastructure we've developed at Robinhood. Two weeks ago at Consensus, our Crypto GM, Johann Kerbrat, announced that we're offering Robinhood Connect to third party developers. We're pleased by the early response we've seen and believe we're well positioned to take market share versus early entrants. Finally, we're making progress towards our ambitious goal of launching brokerage operations in the UK by the end of the year. We have an existing license in place, a brand that resonates, and experienced leaders running the effort. So, we're excited to launch and start driving innovation in the UK market like we've done in the US over the past eight years. We're really excited about the roadmap ahead of us, and there's so much to do. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jason. Yeah, in short, absolutely. This is part of our longer-term roadmap. And we recently launched retirement, as you're probably aware. And we now have hundreds of thousands of customers that have multiple accounts with us. So, with retirement, it was really the first time that a customer could open multiple brokerage accounts within our product. And it took a lot of work to build the infrastructure for that and build the product affordances necessary. So now it's much easier for us to add different account types. And we hear from customers. They want to teach their children about investing. They also are interested in joint accounts and would like to collaborate with their finances and manage them with their partner. So, these things are definitely part of the longer-term roadmap. We want to make sure we continue deepening relationships with our customers, as we've been doing with the launch of retirement. Keen to do it. No specific timeline to share, but stay tuned. Yeah, we're really pleased with the contributions we've seen so far, over half a billion in assets, leading to $5 million in matches to customers. And we're seeing customers continuing to bring more of their cash onto the platform. The feedback that we're hearing has been really good as well. Customers love the match. They also love the fact that we're providing recommendations. And the recommendations are now being used by two-thirds of customers that onboard onto retirement. And we're excited about that, especially when we think about what that means for the future of advisory and providing personalized ongoing advice to our customers to help them manage their investments. Hi, Sujan, yes, we mentioned it on the last call. And we are getting very excited about what we can do in advisory. We've hired some great people, in particular, our Head of Investment Strategy, Steph Guild, who's an industry vet, with 20 years of experience at large financial institutions. You might have seen, she's got a weekly column where she talks about the markets. That's quite good. And we really think that in Robinhood, we can build the expertise necessary to give our customers amazing advice. And we've got teams hard at work building a great advisory product. And we believe that we can deliver that to customers, using the teams we have in house. So, more to come, obviously, as the work progresses, but we think we can we can build something really great for customers here. Yeah. I think that over the next few decades, every company will have to transform into an AI company. Looking at the past 20 years, and how sort of the companies that have been able to move ahead and create differentiated value, have been technology companies, in the same way that every company sort of has needed to become a technology company. I think AI will sort of be embedded into the fabric of all companies. And that's how we're thinking about it. Robinhood has always been early to adopt new technologies like data science and machine learning, both to lower our costs and deliver product experiences and value for our customers. And we're really excited to continue to embed AI as a tool, both internally and helping us ship products even faster, and incorporating into existing products and new products. So, we think that the impact of AI and other tools that we've seen thus far is going to be extraordinary. Yeah, this is something we're excited about. And we hear from our active traders about but we don't offer it today. If you look at Robinhood Connect, which we announced and started rolling out recently, that leverages some of the trading infrastructure on our crypto side for a developer and B2B targeted product. Making it easier for our active traders and innovating for them is top of mind. So, this is definitely something we would look to offer over time. So, stay tuned. At Robinhood safety is our top company value. And when I think about what that means, several things come to mind. First is great customer support. And we made tremendous progress over the past few years, adding more channels improving the quality of customer support overall and making it much better and the progress there continues. The second thing is making sure that our app in our infrastructure is reliable and available to customers when they need us the most and we made tremendous progress there to -- the third is the safety of customers assets within Robinhood. And as we announced earlier in the call with Robinhood, Gold, we're offering a 4.65% APY on customer uninvested cash. And we're also offering 2 million of FDIC insurance starting June 1st. So, your money is going to have higher insurance in Robinhood, Gold and in our cash sweep than you would get at a typical bank. I should also mention, as with every brokerage account, your brokerage assets are SIPC insured, and we also have access to big coverage. So, what does this what does this mean? When we look at kind of how customers are engaging with the service, we're seeing higher NPS indicative of increasing customer trust. And the results speak for themselves, customers are continuing to trust us with their deposits. When we see a lot of institutions in the banking sector and elsewhere are seeing outflows in this quarter, we're continuing to see strong inflows with 1.4 billion in net deposits and 4.4 billion and in Q1. So, we feel really, really good about customers increasingly trusting us. Well, in my opinion, we are the most innovative trading platform in the marketplace. We've introduced several new industry innovations that have become norms, not just zero commission, no account minimum trading, but also recently retirement with a 1% embedded match, which we're very excited about. And with the announcement of 24/5 trading, we're leading the industry once again. So, we're going to continue to focus on our customers. We're going to make progress, launching products in a way that emphasizes customer safety. But we're going to continue to innovate. And I'm very, very excited about the things that we're launching and we have launched in the past few months. Yeah, I don't want to share too much. But what I'll tell you is we want to go beyond just being a robo advisor. And we really want to use technology to give personalized advice at scale, much like what a high-net-worth individual would come to expect from a financial advisor that they'd be paying 1%, 1% AUM advisory fee for and Robinhood can build a great experience for that. That's mobile first. And of course, we'll plan to use every technology that that we think is going to be useful in the market to make that happen and deliver it in a scalable way. Thanks, Rich. Yeah, we've kept the rebates on our crypto offering the same. And, we've been pleased by the market share that we have in the retail US crypto offering, we want to make sure that we offer great pricing to customers. And we think that over time, keeping the pricing very competitive is going to lead to increase market share gains over time. So, it's really, we want to make sure our pricing is awesome. And the user experience continues to be great for the crypto offerings. And we think that it's got a bright future, and we see potential to grow our market share there. Thanks, Dan. Yeah, absolutely, I can feel that one. So, really Robinhood Connect is an on ramp for third party developers to integrate Fiat to crypto into their apps. And we see a big opportunity for us in this space, because the infrastructure that we've developed for the Robinhood App and the Robinhood Wallet to not just move money into the platform but also integrate with various trading partners and get great trade execution allows us to offer not just great customer experience to developers, but great pricing. So, as we look at kind of the space, we see that other on ramps don't have great funding options. They either offer only card, or some of them that offer bank linking are just prohibitively expensive. And in general, the costs are quite high, like north of 5% per transaction. And so, we see an opportunity to take what we built on the consumer side and really offer a differentiated product for customers. In terms of monetization, we believe that we can offer the product at lower prices and still monetize with taking a percentage of every transaction and earn healthy margins for the business over time. Yeah, it's very hard to predict what's going to happen with 24/5 trading. It's fundamentally new in the market, and Robinhood is going to be the first retail broker in the US to offer this for individual names. I think that what we'd like to see is sort of good liquidity available for these symbols, and liquidity to be a little bit smoother, and not as much happening on the open and the close. And I think that would be really, really interesting for the markets. In terms of engagement. We have seen with hyper extended hours, which we launched last year that we saw increased volumes, but I think it's probably a little bit early to, to give estimates for, for what we'd see in terms of volumes there. Hey, Devin, how are you doing? I'd be happy to feel that one. We're very excited about launching futures trading to our customers. And, as I mentioned in the call, the goal is to launch at around the end of this year pending, of course, regulatory approvals. On our application. I think as we think about it, we see two opportunities. One is making a really great product for our active traders. As we've talked about a little bit over the past few quarters, active traders have been an increasing area of focus for us. We've been able to drive Active Trader NPS significantly higher in the past year. We love that our active traders are feeling the love and seeing improvements in the customer experience for the product. And we think that futures trading is an innovative new asset that allow them to manage their risk and in new ways. The second thing that we think we have an opportunity to do is if you look at what we've done with fractional shares, and options, trading Robinhood, historically brought new investors to the market who haven't been investing and haven't had access to these products in the past.  With futures trading, we see a lot of complexity in the existing products and interfaces, which I think makes them less accessible. So, one thing we'd like to do is just simplify that and make that really, really useful and easy to use in mobile. And we think that there's a lot of whitespace ahead of us there. And I want to give a special shout out to JB Mckenzie, who joined as the GM of our futures business. And I know that he's very, very excited to launch this as quickly as possible. And maybe this question provides a little bit extra motivation, not that he needs that. Yeah, the only thing I'd add is just that I think the team has done a fantastic job over the past year, diversifying our business, so that, we can be sustainable in a high interest rate environment. I think, before the fear that we were getting from analysts and the community was doing great in a low interest rate environment, but what if rates tick up? How will you do then, and I think we've shown that this is a resilient business, the team moves fast and innovates. And we're really pleased with how diversified the business has become, and we see opportunities to keep pulling on that and do it even further. But we don't offer cash settled index options. We don't offer cash settled index options. We have zero day, but their ETF yet, ETF options traded on the platform. Yeah, we're making progress towards the goal of launching brokerage in the UK by the end of the year. As I mentioned in the past, we've got an existing license in place. We think that our brand is very strong and will resonate very well in the UK and experienced leaders running the effort. So, stay tuned, but we're excited to make it happen. Thank you. Yeah, thank you guys so much for listening and asking questions. So, we're very excited by the progress. And check out 24 hour market very excited for that to be launching next week."

            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. In the first quarter, we stayed focused on serving customers, growing our business, and driving long-term shareholder value. Our team continued to execute on our product roadmap, scale products we launched over the past year, and drive adjusted EBITDA higher. As I look back over the past year, I'm incredibly proud of how our team executed to transform the financial profile of our business. While a year ago, we had our lowest quarter of adjusted EBITDA, in Q1, we matched our all-time high. We grew revenues for four quarters in a row while getting to a leaner operating model. As a result, our Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $115 million is up over $250 million from a year ago. On an annualized run rate basis, that's an increase of more than $1 billion. And our Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin of 26% was an all-time high. And we aren't stopping here. We are committed to becoming profitable on a GAAP basis, and we're making good progress on that front.  Looking at our Q1 GAAP results, EPS was negative $0.57. This included a one-time non-cash charge from our founders who canceled their 2021 equity awards that significantly reduces our SBC quarterly run rate going forward. EPS, prior to the 2021 founder award cancellation, was negative $0.03, so we're getting much closer to GAAP profitability. Now let's look at our first quarter business results. Customer assets under custody increased 26% sequentially in Q1 to $78 billion as growth stock and crypto valuations rebounded and customers continued to deposit money into Robinhood. Looking at net deposits, they were $4.4 billion in Q1, which translates to a 29% annualized growth rate relative to Q4 AUC. These resilient customer net deposits position us really well for continued asset growth as markets rise over time. Turning to net-funded accounts, which represent unique users on our platform, they increased by 120,000 in Q1 to 23.1 million. Additionally, we now have over 250,000 retirement accounts that already have an average balance of over $2,000. The vast majority of these retirement accounts were funded by existing customers who are significantly increasing their average AUC at Robinhood by making these IRA contributions. We're continuing to work on new disclosures to highlight progress like this as we deepen our relationships with customers. As for monthly active users, they were 11.8 million at the end of Q1, up from 11.4 million a quarter ago. Now let's review Q1 revenues. Total net revenues were $441 million, a 16% increase from Q4 as transaction and net interest revenues increased during the quarter. Q1 ARPU was $77, up from $66 last quarter and the highest level since 2021. Transaction-based revenues were $207 million in Q1, up 11% sequentially. Equity and options volumes picked up from Q4, and crypto volumes were in line with Q4. Moving to net interest revenues, they were $208 million in Q1, up 25% sequentially. The increase was driven by higher securities lending activity, cash suite balances, and short-term interest rates versus Q4 levels, partially offset by lower average margin balances. Q1 interest earning assets were $22 billion, 21%, or $4 billion sequentially, primarily driven by Gold customers continuing to bring more deposits to Robinhood. Looking ahead, we anticipate Q2 net interest revenues will be up roughly $15 million from Q1. This outlook assumes the Q1 level of securities lending revenue and today's levels of balances, deposit rates, and Fed fund rates. Of course, our Q2 results could be higher or lower depending on how the quarter plays out. Moving on to other revenues, they were $26 million in Q1, roughly flat from Q4. Gold subscribers increased for the second quarter in a row to $1.2 million, up about $40,000 sequentially. We love that more customers are benefiting from gold, and this is also good news for our revenues. Gold subscribers have ARPU that is multiples of our average customer, as they bring more assets and use more of our services. This is also true for newer cohorts that joined to take advantage of our high-yield offer. This gives us a lot of confidence to keep investing in the Gold value proposition. Moving ahead, as Q2 is proxy season, which drives a seasonal increase in other revenue, and our Say Technologies team is managing Robinhood's proxy services this year. Because of this, we continue to expect a sequential increase of around $30 million for other revenues in Q2, with Q3 returning to roughly Q1 levels. I also wanted to note that with April being tax month, it's typical across the brokerage industry to see lower net deposits and trading.  For us, it was great to see customers add another $1.4 billion of net deposits in April, in line with our Q1 average. This drove cash suite balances to a new high of $10 billion earlier this week. For MAUs, they declined about 3% in April, and for trading, while options and equities were off 17% and 27%, respectively, versus the Q1 monthly average, crypto volumes were in line with Q1. We hope this color is helpful ahead of providing our monthly metrics next week. Now let's review Q1 expenses. At a high level, we really like the operating leverage we're generating as we stay disciplined on expenses. One measure we track is annualized revenue per employee. In Q1, it was $760,000, which is more than double from a year ago. It was also great to see Q1 adjusted EBITDA grow 40% from Q4, more than twice as fast as total net revenue growth. Looking more closely at our costs, let's first review OPEX prior to SBC. It was $352 million in Q1, slightly below the lower end of our full year 2023 outlook range. Looking forward, there's no change to our full year outlook. We continue to expect 2023 OPEX prior to SBC to be in the range of $1.42 billion to $1.48 billion. And as a reminder, our annual employee merit increases were in March, so you'll see that full effect in Q2. Turning to SBC, it was $598 million in Q1, which included the one-time $485 million non-cash charge from the founder award cancellation. This Q1 result was about $30 million better than our previous first quarter outlook. We're flowing this through into our full year 2023 SBC outlook to improve it to $925 million to $1.005 billion. I also wanted to highlight that over the long term, we think it's important to manage share-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to lower levels. In Q1, apart from the founder award cancellation, SBC was 26% of total revenues, down significantly from a year ago. And as we look ahead, we're working to lower that percentage more over time. Now turning to capital management. In Q1, our balance sheet remained strong with about $6 billion of corporate cash and investments. This includes about $500 million that we moved in Q1 from cash into a laddered portfolio of treasuries and other high-quality assets with an average duration of less than a year. As for capital deployment, I wanted to briefly note that we are making some progress on discussions to purchase most or all of the 55 million Robinhood shares that were acquired last summer by Emergent Fidelity Technologies. We don't have any specifics to share yet, but we look forward to providing updates when we can. In closing, I'm really pleased with the financial progress we've made over the past year while continuing to deliver new capabilities and enhancing customer experience. Q1 was the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, and we continue to focus on driving profitable growth over time. With that, Chris, let's move to Q&A. Great. Thanks for the questions. We're really focused on three things to drive shareholder value. First, we want to keep launching new products and improve upon our existing products. We've made a lot of momentum here and our product velocity is fast as we've seen it so far as a company.  So, we feel really good about that. The second is, is we want to drive profitable growth. And we're going to keep our costs lean and find ways to drive even more efficiency over time. This quarter, it was nice to see our adjusted EBITDA grow at twice the rate of our revenue growth. And we're working on driving leverage in our business even more over time. And then lastly, what I'd say is we want to efficiently deploy our capital. This would include how we deploy capital for organic growth opportunities, for possible M&A growth. And as well, over time, could include returning some capital to shareholders. And I think if we do these three things really well over time, it should create a lot of shareholder value.  In terms of reaching profitable growth, I don't want to predict any particular timeline on that. But we are getting really close. Excluding the founder award cancellation our EPS was minus $0.03 per share. So, we're going to keep focusing on rolling out new products and keeping our costs lean. And we should get there over time. Thanks for the question. Yeah, thanks for these questions. First, I think it's really important to clarify that Robinhood is not a bank. We keep our customer cash liquid, and we don't have the risk of asset liability mismatch that banks have to manage. Also, it's great to see that our customers continue to deposit funds with us. Gold cash suite balances were up 67% from last quarter, up to $8 billion. And in March, when all the banking turbulence happened, our customers deposited $1.5 billion with us. So, we think we're in a really good position, and particularly as customers respond to our great offerings for Gold members. So, thanks for the question. One thing that I'd add is if you look at total accounts that we added this year between brokerage and retirement, it was about the same number of total accounts that we opened in all of last year. So, it's really nice to see this kind of acceleration and new account growth. Yeah, thanks for the question. And thanks for letting me answer this one instead of Vlad. Want to make Gold the best deal in financial services, we think it's a great deal at $5 per month, just a great value overall, we're going to keep investing in the product to make it even better. And for now, we don't have any plans to give it away for free. Yeah, thanks for the question. Rich, and we were pleased to see that the pickup in NII. I mean, there's a few things that I call out you highlighted, securities lending, you'll recall that last quarter, was a particularly soft quarter for sec lending. And at the time of the call, we were cautious in the way that we were evaluating the outlook for Q1. And the activity for sec lending in Q1 was strong and in addition to the strength of just the activity, which increased the rebates as well as the interest we earn on collateral. We also saw rebate rates tick up meaningfully in the quarter and so this led to some outperformance. We also saw strength in customer deposits. And also, the flow through of interest rate on those incremental deposits beyond kind of what we were anticipating. So, overall, really pleased it was higher than we expected. And we were pleased with that. April thank you. Yeah, the connection is a little poor Dan, but I think we got your question. So, April, as is tax months. And, across the industry, you tend to see customer dollars flowing, flowing for taxes and less in trading and engagement in deposits. We actually had a really strong April from a deposits perspective. 1.4 million coming in, the trading was softer than what we saw in Q1. That's normal. It's expected. We saw it last year. And as we look across industry results, it's pretty much in line with what others are seeing as well. Yeah, thanks, Devin. Great, question. So first of all, in this market backdrop, I do like having a really strong balance sheet. And as you mentioned, $6 billion in cash and investments, given this market backdrop, I think has been a source of strength for us. I like that. But it's not an ideal capital structure.  And over time, I think you'll see us continue to work on that, to be even more efficient. My mind goes to the M&A front when I think about use of capital, beyond just running our business. And I'd say that the environments becoming more constructive, the bid ask spread has been incredibly wide, as public markets corrected, and I think private markets are a bit slow to face that reality. And I think it's been more constructive now. And it's up to us to look at opportunities. You talked about hurdle rates, it's looking at things like what's the return on invested capital? Will it be accretive to our business? And then in terms of the business itself? Is it going to accelerate our roadmap and does the team that we acquire, share the values that we have around a culture around safety and compliance, as well as an obsession for customer experience? So, these are all the things that we are looking at. And like I said, I'd say that the backdrop is improving there. Yeah, thanks, Mike. It's Jason I'll start. And we'll see if Vlad wants to add any color, in terms of reaching and ultimately sustaining GAAP profitability. There's a couple of elements that are really important. The first is continuing to improve our user experience on our existing products, expand the service capability of existing products, and then also keep rolling out new products for customers. And we're seeing a lot of traction here, our product velocity is only getting faster, and customers are really responding, we're seeing that in our NPS score being up over 20 points, overall, and up over 30 points for our most active customers. So really, really encouraging signals. To your point, our revenue is diversifying interest income is becoming a larger portion of that things like securities lending is also contributing but also interest on cash as well. When we think about the dynamic between, rising rates and falling rates and the effect on revenue, there's a couple things that I point out first, there is a bit of a natural offset between changes in interest rates and demand for equities or trading activity. And so, while it's not a perfect correlation, they do tend to move in opposite directions. And we think that's, good for the balance of our business. I'd also say that as we continue to roll out new products that that's just going to further diversify and really strengthen the revenue profile, of our business. The last thing we're looking at, and I mentioned it last quarter, is we are evaluating whether we want to use any kind of hedging for significant rate drops, to manage our sensitivity to interest rates, we've been looking at whether, option floor strategy, for example, that could be a way to maintain liquidity, do it at a modest cost, and not introduce any P&L variability. We haven't made a decision there yet. But it's something that we're continuing to look at. Yeah, so the crypto environment has, faced, increasing regulatory scrutiny. The things that I'd point out is that, we've been a safety first company, for a long time, it's been a core value. In fact, it's our top company value and Vlad talked about it on these calls in the past. What this has meant is that, we've been very deliberate in the way that we expand our coin offering, we've got a rigorous coin framework, and we're very careful in the way that we evaluate those points. I'd say if you if you compare Robinhood to perhaps others, across the industry, we consistently demonstrate that we have respect for the securities regulations of the country. And, and this has led to us making tough decisions on product selection, don't offer staking, that's something that's been under scrutiny as well. And so, we'll continue to operate with that mindset. We want to be on the right side of these decisions at the same time we want to innovate for customers. And I think additional regulatory clarity would be super helpful on that front. Thanks. Yeah, and I'd say that, thanks for your question Will. I'd say that the securities lending business is less beholding to monthly engagement metrics. It's based more on how many of our customers have opted in whether or not they're engaging on a monthly on a monthly basis with us. We've seen overall strength in the market for securities lending this quarter, I'd say Q4 was unusually soft, it was one of the softest quarters that I've seen in the years that I've been here. But there was a strong backdrop. In Q1 that continues here into Q2. So, demand was higher, it allowed us with the backdrop of adding more customers to the fully paid securities program. Securities lending program to be able to lend out even more help our customers, optimize their own yield by participating. And the rebates that we saw were particularly strong, so far, in Q2, we continue to see, levels, consistent with what we were seeing in Q1. Yeah, sure. So, the take rate is really just an effect of mix. So, no change in the pricing structure, but the tier that includes spy contracts has just been increasing as an overall percentage in this market backdrop, and that's shown up in a reduced blended rate. You bet. Thanks, Will. Yeah, sure. I mean, the cash card, is off to a good start. I'd say it's really early Ken. And, the uptake, is a few 100, a couple 100,000 customers. And what we're really working on is continuing to iterate on the value proposition. We want that card to be kind of top of wallet, and we're not there yet. So, the team is hard at work. We're talking to customers, we're evaluating the value proposition. I think longer term, this has potential to be, a meaningful, engagement driver for us and will help us deepen our relationships. But we're not there yet, but it's early. Sure, Ken I'll start and we'll see if Vlad adds any colors. So, first, I'd say hundreds of thousands is the order of magnitude on options traders. So, a relatively small portion of our customers are engaged in in options trading every month. In terms of zero day options. We don't currently offer those. It's something that we do hear from customers that they're interested in -- Thanks, Vlad. And so in terms of expanding that to cash settled, it's something that we'll evaluate over time. Yeah, thanks for the question. So, yeah, we saw MA use go from 11.8 to 11.4 in April. And really what I'd pointed, it's in the zone of where we were, sorry, 11.5. It's in the zone of where we were in in Q1, it's nice to see that it's kind of stabilized. And I just point to the seasonal dynamics of April that I referred to earlier in my comments. Yeah, it's more. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, in the broader context, we've got $6 billion of cash on our balance sheet, and it just was good hygiene for us to take a small portion of that, and extend the duration of it. So, it's held to maturity, it's, it's a laddered portfolio that's rolling. So, it's highly liquid. And that was the logic behind it. Just looking at the fair value, it's right on what the purchase price was of the portfolio."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Robinhood Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now like to turn the call over to Chris Koegel, Vice President of Corporate, FP&A and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Koegel : Thank you, Catherine, and thank you to everyone for joining Robinhood's Q3 earnings call. With us today are CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev and CFO Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor are described in the press release we issued today, the earnings presentation, and our SEC filings, all of which can be found at investors.robinhood.com. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the GAAP measures we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev : Thanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. Let me start by reiterating Robinhood's three areas of focus. Number one, winning the active trader market. Number two, increasing wallet share with our customers. And number three, expanding internationally. In Q3, we continue to make progress on all of these fronts. In fact, our results after the first three quarters of the year have already broken through a number of full-year records. And we have another quarter in front of us to take these results even higher. Just to share a few examples. First, Q3 net deposits were $10 billion or more for the third straight quarter as we continue to increase wallet share. This brings us to $34 billion year-to-date, above our 2020 record of $31 billion, and also takes our customer assets under custody to a record high of $152 billion. Second, Q3 options contracts were up 47% year-over-year to a new record as we keep winning with active traders. This brings our year-to-date total to $1.2 billion contracts, edging out our full-year high from 2021. And third, Q3 was another strong financial quarter with our second highest revenues ever. Revenues grew 36% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA increased 96% from a year ago. Looking year-to-date, revenues of nearly $2 billion have already broken last year's record of $1.9 billion, and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 is multiples of any prior year. It's energizing to see our business performing well like this, but we're even more excited about our product roadmap. A key part of increasing wallet share with customers is growing Robinhood Gold subscriptions, which hit an all-time high of $2.2 million in Q3. And one of the most exciting new parts of the Gold program is our Robinhood Gold card. When I've talked to Robinhood customers in recent months, the Gold card almost always comes up. If someone has it, they love it. If they don't have it, they want to know when they're going to get it. And I hear you. We're working hard to increase the rollout, but we're also being patient and carefully studying customer behavior as we grow so that we manage credit risk to profitably scale over time. While it's still early, I wanted to share some emerging data from our 100,000 Gold card customers. First, customers love the Gold card. App store ratings continue to be five out of five with over 10,000 five-star reviews. Customers tell us they love the metal card, the digital app, and of course, the 3% rewards. Second, the early customer behavior is in line with our expectations. It looks like the Gold card is top of wallet for most customers, and early data shows that we're retaining approximately 95% of Gold card customers following their first transaction. We're also starting to see customer spending grow and loan balances revolve as expected. Third, Gold card customers are also contributing meaningfully higher net deposits versus similar customers. It's great to see the early additional benefits to the platform. All in all, while it's still quite early, we're further increasing confidence that we can scale the Gold card significantly over time. Now, let me turn it over to Jason to review our financial results, and then I'll offer some additional thoughts.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad, and thanks everyone for joining us today. In Q3, we had another strong quarter, growing revenues 36% and driving 77% incremental adjusted EBITDA margins versus a year ago. Q3 business results also set a number of new highs, including assets under custody, options contracts, cash suite balances, and retirement AUC, as well as multi-year highs for equity volumes and margin balances. And as we enter 2024 focused on driving another year of profitable growth, we're excited that we've already broken records for full-year revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share. Looking at the progress we made in Q3 versus a year ago. Assets under custody grew 76% to a record $152 billion. Net deposits were $10 billion plus for the third straight quarter and $39 billion over the past year. This translates to annualized net deposit growth rates of 29% in Q3 and 45% over the past year. Total net revenues grew 36% to $637 million. Adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled to $268 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 13 points to 42% and net income grew to $150 million or $0.17 per share. This was reduced by one cent for a regulatory accrual in the quarter. We're pleased with these results which mark our fourth straight quarter of GAAP profitability and ninth straight quarter positive adjusted EBITDA. Now let's look more closely at Q3 revenues which increased year-over-year across all three categories. Transaction based revenues grew 72% as we drove higher volumes and market share gains across all trading products. It was great to see option, equity and crypto volumes up 47%, 65% and over 100% from a year ago respectively. Net interest revenues increased 9% as we grew interest earning assets and securities lending activity improved. This included customers growing their cash suite balances 80% year-over-year and margin balances building to a two year high. Lastly, other revenues grew by 42% as we added over 850,000 gold subscribers in the past year to reach a record 2.2 million subscribers and record annualized recurring gold subscription revenue of over $110 million. I'd also note that our Q3 revenues include the impact of contra revenues from amortizing matches on customer deposits and transfers. Q3 contra revenues were $27 million up $14 million sequentially, mostly driven by the 1% gold deposit boost. We expect contra revenues to grow sequentially by a similar amount in Q4 and then grow much slower in 2025. To provide some more context, customers love the matches we provide on asset transfers and IRA contributions and we're seeing great payback periods on these matches. At the same time, the 1% gold deposit boost has not driven as much incremental customer activity as our other promotions. So we've decided to wind it down in November to focus on offers that resonate more with customers. As an example, we doubled down recently for our hood week promotion by offering a range of matches on asset transfers. And in just two weeks, this led to $2 billion of transfers in from brokerage incumbents that averaged over $130,000 per customer. Stepping back, when we reflect on our revenue so far this year, it feels good that our last three quarters are the three highest in company history. Turning to Q3 expenses, we had another good quarter of expense discipline. Combined adjusted OpEx and SBC was $476 million in Q3 in the middle of our \u201824 outlook range on a quarterly basis. Looking ahead to Q4, we're pleased that we're still on track for our full year outlook range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion of adjusted OpEx and SBC, even while driving nearly 40% year-over-year revenue growth for the first three quarters of the year. We anticipate we'll likely finish near the top end of that range given our continued growth investments to finish the year strong. Turning to capital management, we started our 1 billion share repurchase program in July. We allocated 97 million to repurchase 5 million shares in Q3 and made good initial progress on our expected two to three year total timeline. We love deploying capital like this. It lowers our share count and positions us to increase EPS and free cash flow per share over time. And when we look at last year's share repurchase, plus the start of our new program, we've deployed over $700 million to repurchase approximately 60 million of our shares, equivalent to about 7% of our current diluted count. And we're continuing to repurchase shares daily in Q4. Before passing it back to Vlad, I'd like to comment on the strong momentum we are seeing so far in October. Net deposits are north of $4 billion, and cash suite balances are more than 25 billion. As for trading, equity notional volumes highest month in over three years. Option contracts look to be one of the highest months ever and crypto notional volumes are over $5 billion on track to exceed the Q3 monthly average. I'd also highlight that our crypto rebates have increased to 48 basis points in October relative to our 44 basis point average in Q3 and 35 basis points at the start of the year strong. Longer term, we're energized by the progress we're making and believe we are well positioned to drive higher earnings and free cash flow per share over time, driven by our 20% plus net deposit growth, diversified business model and 90% fixed cost base. With that, I'll turn the call back to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev : Thanks, Jason. Now, I want to highlight our progress on the first part of our strategy winning with active traders. Two weeks ago, we held our inaugural Hood Summit in Miami. It was really awesome to have over 400 active trader customers together for a few days and we introduced three exciting new products. First, we announced Index Options, which are one of the fastest growing retail products and make up nearly 10% of U.S. retail options contracts. Our customers have been trading them on other platforms to date, so they're excited to bring their trades to Robinhood and leverage our industry-leading pricing and we're excited to expand our addressable market. Second, we announced Futures. Here, we're not only offering industry-leading pricing, but also a great customer experience with our awesome Futures ladder. We continue to believe that Futures can be a nine-figure revenue business for us over time. Also, building out the infrastructure behind Futures has also enabled us to offer event contracts, including our new presidential election market that we launched. It was great to see customers quickly engage with this new product, trading over 10 million contracts in the first full day, and on track to more than double that today. Third, we launched Robinhood Legend, our new state-of-the-art desktop platform, which we built from the bottom up for active traders. It's clear from customer feedback that Legend is really resonating, so we're doubling down on this new domain. The team is hard at work to rapidly ship more functionality for customers. As additional context, while we are number one in mobile trading, that's only half the retail trading market today. The other half is on web, where we haven't meaningfully competed in the past. So launching Legend is doubling our addressable market. We have a lot of momentum in our active trader offering as we close out the year. As I said earlier, Q3 option volumes were up 47% year-over-year to a new record. And Q3 equity volumes also increased, up 65% year-over-year to a three-year high. And this is even before the full rollout of index options Futures and Robinhood Legend. In closing, we had another strong quarter in Q3, and you should know, our team continues to work incredibly hard to deliver even more value to our customers. The roadmap is full, there's so much to do, and we're excited to share a lot more with you at our Investor Day in December. Now, let's move to questions.\nA - Chris Koegel : Thank you, Vlad. For the Q&A session, we'll start by answering the top few shareholder questions from Say Technologies, ranked by number of votes. We passed over questions that we already addressed on this call or in prior quarters, and grouped together questions that shared a common theme. After the Say questions, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So I'll kick it off with our first question from Say, which is for Vlad. Vlad, when will the Robinhood Gold card be available to all users?\nVlad Tenev : Yeah, thank you for the question. I think that the first thing I want to say is we've really been humbled by the demand we've seen so far for the Gold credit card. The waitlist is close to 2 million, and so far we've rolled it out to about 100,000 customers. And I think if you compare this to how other successful credit card programs that are new have scaled, that's a pretty quick ramp. But of course, we also recognize it's small compared to the waitlist. The waitlist, frankly, exceeded our expectations, and we're working as hard as we can to get it out as quickly as we can. But it's also important for us to make sure we don't incur significant near-term losses. So we have to understand the customer behavior and the economics because the credit card business can get quite big. And also, if we're not careful, that could mean losses. So as I mentioned earlier, we like the behavior we're seeing. And if the behavior we're seeing continues in this way, over the next year we expect to roll the card out to multiples of where we are today.\nChris Koegel : Right. Thank you, Vlad. The next question is also for you. And it asks, are there any plans to introduce a way to send or receive money to other Robinhood users via the Robinhood ecosystem?\nVlad Tenev : Yeah, we've actually experimented with this in the past when we rolled out Robinhood Spending and the Robinhood Cash Card a couple years ago. Now, right now the focus is really on the credit card offering. We're seeing amazing feedback and strong demand for that. So we're focusing on making sure we scale that. But we do anticipate growing our offerings so that anything that you can do on another consumer finance app or product can be done on Robinhood as well. So this is certainly something that we're thinking about.\nChris Koegel : All right. The third question is also on Robinhood Gold. So rate cuts make Robinhood Gold worse each time. How will gold continue to add value to users, and what new benefits is Robinhood planning to add for gold users? Also for Vlad.\nVlad Tenev : Yeah. So the strategy with gold is to deliver an offering that provides customers with exceptional value in every market environment, regardless of whether the rates are increasing or decreasing. You should be able to get tremendous value from Robinhood Gold. Now, some of the value props naturally do well in an increasing rate environment. Cash sweep with high APY is one of them. Other products tend to be more attractive in declining rate environments. And as a matter of fact, at Hood Summit, we recently announced that gold customers will receive differentiated better pricing on a few of the products we announced. So the pricing, while industry-leading across the board is even better on index options and futures for our gold subscribers. So while rates on sweeps may be coming down because of Fed cuts, we're going to keep investing in gold. And for every new product we launch, we ask ourselves, how can we make it even better for our gold subscribers? And as you see, as we continue to roll out new products, gold should get even better and better.\nChris Koegel : Great. Thank you, Vlad. And last one for you Jason. Jason, can you describe the plans for the live tax gain and loss monitoring that you're rolling out?\nJason Warnick: Sure. There's a couple things I'd highlight on tax management. First of all, we recognize it's really important for customers. Just yesterday, we announced a realized P&L tool shipped. So that one's live for customers now. And we also know that tax lot selection in the app is important for customers. And I'm excited to tell you that we have employee beta testing going on right now for tax lots. And the team is pushing hard to get it in the hands of customers really soon.\nVlad Tenev : We think it's really good. Yeah. I think you're going to like it.\nChris Koegel : All right. That concludes our shareholder questions from Say Technologies. We appreciate our shareholders taking the time to ask these questions of Vlad and Jason and the board and more next quarter. So now I'll turn the call over to Catherine to lead Q&A from our analysts.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good afternoon, everyone. Hope everyone's doing well. First, we want to congratulate you on the Legend launch. And I saw there were, I think, a thousand signups in the first 40 seconds, Vlad, post the launch. But what is the level of signups to date and how many of them are incremental signups to the 24.4 million accounts that are Robinhood as of September 30th?\nVlad Tenev : Yeah, I mean, we are still, the product is not quite ungated in the sense that anyone can just access it. So we've been rolling out to multiples of that number, but haven't yet sort of like opened it up to everyone. Early feedback is extremely positive. I mean, I don't know, you guys probably see the level of live streamers and folks on social media has been tremendous. And the team is, I'd say, even more motivated to keep the momentum and make sure the product is better and better because we really feel like we've got something great here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nDan Dolev: Hey, Vlad. Hey, guys. Great results again. I'm very proud of you.\nVlad Tenev : Thanks, Dan.\nDan Dolev: Yeah, of course. Well-deserved. I was very intrigued with the presidential election market. And I wanted to know, it's got a lot of press and we've been getting a lot of questions on it. So can you give us some color on how it's doing, how creative it is to overall retention? Anything you can tell us about it would be great. Thank you.\nVlad Tenev : Yeah. So first off, we just rolled out to 100% of customers after starting the rollout just this Monday. So huge kudos to the team for that. The path to offer this product was paved really less than 30 days ago. And we really moved quickly to make it available to customers ahead of the election. So to give a little bit of context around this, one of our focus areas is to win the active trader market. And I think really to do that, our approach is that if you're an active trader, using Robinhood should put you in a position, you should really associate Robinhood with being at the forefront of technology and innovation and trading. And I think offering products like these, which you can't really find at many of our competitors is the best way to do that. So feedback is really, really good. You can see on social that it's resonating with customers very, very clearly. But we rolled out to 100% right before the call started. So I think it's a little bit early to tell to give you too much. Other than yesterday, we did about 10 million contracts. That was pre-full rollout. And we've done even more than that already today.\nDan Dolev: Thanks.\nVlad Tenev : We can take the next one.\nOperator: Yes, okay. Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Moley: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I just had one on index options and futures trading. Now that you've announced the pricing on those products, I was hoping you could help us better understand the economics there. I know index options carry a relatively high exchange fee. So what do your margins look like in offering those contracts? How much do you expect to make per contract? And then maybe as part of that, your expectation for how much volume is going to come from gold versus non-gold members. And then if I could add a follow on modeling question, it looks like your equity fee capture declined by about 20% sequentially. So any color there on what drove that would be helpful. Thanks.\nJason Warnick: Sure, Patrick. I'll go ahead and take both of those. This is Jason. So just going index options first, the non-gold price will be industry leading at $0.50 per contract and the gold price will be even better at $0.35 per contract. Cash settled index options, as you know, is a really fast growing segment within options. And so we see this as a big opportunity for us to take market share even faster. As context, we have been taking double digit market share for some time now and that's without having this hotter segment offer. Also on fees, like exchange fees, we'll be passing those through to the customers. On futures, non-gold, $0.75 per contract and gold gets an even better deal at $0.50 per contract. We've said that futures over time, based on volumes we've seen at our competitors. We think it could be a nine figure business for us. So big opportunity for us. The second part of your question was equity take rates. There's really two things that affect our take rate on equity. The first is volatility and the second is mix. And what we saw in the quarter was just customers buying more larger, more liquid names.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Good evening, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just on the cadence of customer pickup as we move into 4Q. Just on futures and index contracts in terms of what portion of the user base have you rolled the futures out to so far? And what are the maybe rough plans in doing that for the rest of the quarter. And then same on the index options timing of when you expect to roll that. And if I could just sneak one more in on desktop users, good to hear the great feedback. Any observation yet on increased velocity from the folks that are using it so far?\nVlad Tenev : Yeah. I would say that the folks that use the Robinhood Legend product tend to be among our most active. So, the velocity is quite high. That being said, we rolled it out to 1,000 people during the Robinhood Legend keynote and it was the first 1,000 people that sort of like signed into their Robinhood accounts on desktop. And I think we filled the 1,000 slots in 45 seconds. So, those customers were very keen and engaged to try the product. Early feedback is very positive. And I think it's really important to establish a great reputation among active traders because they're networked in a way. They talk to each other, they listen to other active traders and what we've been seeing is really positive signs from the community about Robinhood Legend. But that said, it's not rolled out fully yet, so we don't have the perfect picture of what it's going to look like at 100%, but so far we really like what we're seeing.\nChris Koegel : Timing on futures and index options?\nVlad Tenev : Yeah, timing on index options and futures. So, the first Robinhood derivatives product that rolled out is our presidential election market. Futures Outrights will probably be rolled out in the coming months, but right now the focus of the futures business is really just making sure everything goes as smoothly as possible for the election next week. And then, of course, rolling out Outrights is a top priority. Index options as well coming in the coming months.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with Citizen JMP. Please go ahead.\nDevin Ryan: Great. Hi, Vlad. Hi, Jason. How are you?\nVlad Tenev : Great.\nDevin Ryan: Want to ask a question just on interest rate sensitivity. So, obviously, we saw the first 50 basis points in Fed cuts. Last quarter, I think you talked about 25 basis points as a $40 million impact and that was just essentially the simple math off of balances at the time and didn't take into consideration potential for accelerating margin utilization or higher SEC lending activity or higher transaction activity, which often happens as rates come down. So, I'd just love to get a sense of whether you're seeing or expecting to see kind of an acceleration in margin, how you would frame the upside in SEC lending. It seems like we're operating at a depressed level. Do you see a lot of upside in a more normal environment? And then are there any other kind of offsetting forces just that we should be thinking about beyond just the simple math of a rate times the balance? Thanks.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, you bet. And the rate times the balance, again, this quarter would be roughly $40 million for each rate cut. On margin, we've been seeing really nice growth in margin balances following the reduction of rates for customers. That's continued into October. So, that's been moving up. We'll share that number with you here in a couple of weeks. In terms of SEC lending, a couple of dynamics going on there. First, on just the business inputs themselves, we had about 400,000 additional customers join the program this year and several billion in equities added to the program, which is great for the long-term viability of that program. At the same time, we saw rates on specials that we get hard to borrows, come down a bit versus Q2. And I think that's really what you're seeing. But in terms of the underlying business drivers, we feel really good about that. And then lastly, we've talked about for some time about how we think we have a naturally hedged business model that as rates come down, we see interest rates turn into a tail wind for the business around growth. I think you've already started to see some of that with the trading activity, options at an all-time high in Q3, equities hitting a multi-year high. So, I'm feeling even more confident about the tailwinds that come from falling rates. And we'll just have to see how it plays out from here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead. You might be on mute, Benjamin.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi, sorry. This is Ben. Can you hear me?\nVlad Tenev : Yes. We can hear you now.\nBenjamin Budish: Hey, sorry about that. I had the phone stuck on mute. Well, thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk kind of generally about your path to product kind of innovation and launch. It looks like with the active trader offering, the credit card, you're being very kind of cautious and measured in terms of the rollout. How should we read that into future product development? I think we're all expecting a lot to be announced at the December Investor Day. You've talked about broader ambitions in crypto, global kind of brokerage offerings. So yeah, could you talk about sort of your approach to product velocity and how we should think about the pace of rollout for current and future product launches? Thank you.\nVlad Tenev : Yeah. I think that it really depends on the product we're talking about. I mean, for example, just this week with presidential election market, we started the rollout on Monday and completed it on Wednesday, which is very quick particularly for a new product. Credit card is a little bit of a different animal. I mean, nothing technological is preventing us from rolling that out. It's just really looking at other successful credit card programs in the past and making sure that with a wait list of 2 million customers that business could get quite big. But if we don't manage it carefully, losses could get big as well. So to avoid that, we want to make sure we prudently scale it. And so far, we've onboarded about 100,000 customers who love it and early signs are good. And that's roughly in line with how fast other successful card programs have scaled in kind of like the first year of operations. So that one, it's just us making sure that we're understanding customer behavior, understanding credit, since that's a new business for us. And we're feeling good. But yeah, we recognize the demand is extreme. So we're working to onboard people as quickly as possible. And we expect to get to multiples of our current level over the next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Todaro with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.\nJohn Todaro: Hey, Vlad, Jason, thanks for taking the question. I guess just going back to the futures index offerings, any expenses down the road that we should be thinking about increasing on the back of that? I don't recall if we got to kind of that margin of where it should shake out. And then also just what drove the crypto rebates higher to 48 basis points?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, I'll go ahead and take both of those. So first on the crypto rebates, we've been experimenting for some time on crypto rebates and we've been seeing the rebate rate come up. We always want to have great prices for customers, but also balance the return that we generate for shareholders on that activity. And so we started the year at about 35 basis points and you've seen it move up, including in October where we're running at 48 basis points. In terms of futures and index options, those products really benefit from the broader technology structure that we have at the company. We have roughly 90% fixed costs base and relatively low variable costs and futures and index options benefit from that as well, which leads to really high incremental margins as we grow those businesses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Advisor. Please go ahead.\nSteven Chubak: Hi, good evening. I wanted to start off with a question on actually a chart that you had included in a recent presentation deck, just showing the strong relationship between revenues and AUC. It's been a persistent trend over the last few quarters. I mean, in this particular quarter, we did see some decoupling amid some of the rate cuts and subdued trading activity. And we're just hoping you could speak to your confidence level that, that relationship should ultimately still hold even amid the impact of further rate cuts from the Fed.\nVlad Tenev : Yeah, I feel really good about that relationship, Steven. I mean, one way to think about it is just bridging revenue from Q2 to Q3. There's really two things that distinguish our second quarter and our third quarter. The first is in the second quarter, we have seasonally high proxy revenue. That was about $30 million, and you saw that reduction in Q3 as we moved past that seasonal quarter. The second bridge item from Q2 to Q3 is the contra revenues on the match promotions. And in the quarter, we saw a step up to $27 million. That was an increase of about $14 million in contra revenues versus Q2. And I think that's showing up in the relationship that you're drawing to AUC. Importantly, most of the incremental $14 million related to the 1% boost on gold deposits, and that's something that we're winding down in November. So as we look forward to Q4, we expect Q4 to step up contra revenues in a similar amount that we saw from Q2 to Q3, but then subside and grow at a slower rate. Zooming out, I feel really good longer term about the core business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Stein with FT Partners. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Stein: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wondering, could you discuss the deposit trends for some of the recent promotional offers? And then what's your strategy for deposit bonuses going forward? Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, we love the matches on deposits. We've seen customers really respond to it. From a finance perspective, we track the behavior of the cohorts and dollars that come in, and we've seen, for example, the 2023 match promotions have already paid off. The payback periods are around one year for 1% and kind of in the two to three year zone, trending more towards three years on the retirement matches that are 3%. So we feel really, really good about that. It's our third straight quarter of $10 billion plus in net deposits from our customers and continuing with a longer term trend of 20% plus growth. The Hood Week promotions that we did brought in $2 billion. So that was a two-week promotion and really, really strong response from customers. And in addition to the relatively quick payback periods, we just love the potential for compounding the facts for the business over time.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Madeline Gliden [ph] on for Ken. Thanks for taking our question. You discussed it a bit already, but we wanted to dig a little more into the strategy around the election-related event contracts. So could you walk us through your ultimate decision to list these event contracts, how they fit into the product roadmap, and ultimately, is Robinhood considering getting bigger into these more betting-type products? Thank you.\nVlad Tenev : Yeah. I'd say overall, as a philosophy, we want to make all product categories available for customers over time, particularly for active traders. We want Robinhood to be associated with being at the frontier of innovation and technology in financial services. So if you look specifically at these event contracts, they're regulated swaps markets that really serve as legitimate hedging instruments for large institutions. And we believe that if any tool or any instrument is available for institutions, then we have to make it available for retail as well. I think a nice other secondary impact is it provides people with a reliable data source about where predictions, where people predict the market will land.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Vlad Tenev, Chairman and CEO, for closing remarks.\nVlad Tenev : Yeah. Thank you. Thank you to everyone for listening and to our institutional and retail analysts for continuing to engage. And really, a special thank you to all the folks on social media who've been posting content and streaming using Robinhood Legend and sharing feedback. We really appreciate it.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. Let me start by reiterating Robinhood's three areas of focus. Number one, winning the active trader market. Number two, increasing wallet share with our customers. And number three, expanding internationally. In Q3, we continue to make progress on all of these fronts. In fact, our results after the first three quarters of the year have already broken through a number of full-year records. And we have another quarter in front of us to take these results even higher. Just to share a few examples. First, Q3 net deposits were $10 billion or more for the third straight quarter as we continue to increase wallet share. This brings us to $34 billion year-to-date, above our 2020 record of $31 billion, and also takes our customer assets under custody to a record high of $152 billion. Second, Q3 options contracts were up 47% year-over-year to a new record as we keep winning with active traders. This brings our year-to-date total to $1.2 billion contracts, edging out our full-year high from 2021. And third, Q3 was another strong financial quarter with our second highest revenues ever. Revenues grew 36% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA increased 96% from a year ago. Looking year-to-date, revenues of nearly $2 billion have already broken last year's record of $1.9 billion, and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 is multiples of any prior year. It's energizing to see our business performing well like this, but we're even more excited about our product roadmap. A key part of increasing wallet share with customers is growing Robinhood Gold subscriptions, which hit an all-time high of $2.2 million in Q3. And one of the most exciting new parts of the Gold program is our Robinhood Gold card. When I've talked to Robinhood customers in recent months, the Gold card almost always comes up. If someone has it, they love it. If they don't have it, they want to know when they're going to get it. And I hear you. We're working hard to increase the rollout, but we're also being patient and carefully studying customer behavior as we grow so that we manage credit risk to profitably scale over time. While it's still early, I wanted to share some emerging data from our 100,000 Gold card customers. First, customers love the Gold card. App store ratings continue to be five out of five with over 10,000 five-star reviews. Customers tell us they love the metal card, the digital app, and of course, the 3% rewards. Second, the early customer behavior is in line with our expectations. It looks like the Gold card is top of wallet for most customers, and early data shows that we're retaining approximately 95% of Gold card customers following their first transaction. We're also starting to see customer spending grow and loan balances revolve as expected. Third, Gold card customers are also contributing meaningfully higher net deposits versus similar customers. It's great to see the early additional benefits to the platform. All in all, while it's still quite early, we're further increasing confidence that we can scale the Gold card significantly over time. Now, let me turn it over to Jason to review our financial results, and then I'll offer some additional thoughts. Thanks, Jason. Now, I want to highlight our progress on the first part of our strategy winning with active traders. Two weeks ago, we held our inaugural Hood Summit in Miami. It was really awesome to have over 400 active trader customers together for a few days and we introduced three exciting new products. First, we announced Index Options, which are one of the fastest growing retail products and make up nearly 10% of U.S. retail options contracts. Our customers have been trading them on other platforms to date, so they're excited to bring their trades to Robinhood and leverage our industry-leading pricing and we're excited to expand our addressable market. Second, we announced Futures. Here, we're not only offering industry-leading pricing, but also a great customer experience with our awesome Futures ladder. We continue to believe that Futures can be a nine-figure revenue business for us over time. Also, building out the infrastructure behind Futures has also enabled us to offer event contracts, including our new presidential election market that we launched. It was great to see customers quickly engage with this new product, trading over 10 million contracts in the first full day, and on track to more than double that today. Third, we launched Robinhood Legend, our new state-of-the-art desktop platform, which we built from the bottom up for active traders. It's clear from customer feedback that Legend is really resonating, so we're doubling down on this new domain. The team is hard at work to rapidly ship more functionality for customers. As additional context, while we are number one in mobile trading, that's only half the retail trading market today. The other half is on web, where we haven't meaningfully competed in the past. So launching Legend is doubling our addressable market. We have a lot of momentum in our active trader offering as we close out the year. As I said earlier, Q3 option volumes were up 47% year-over-year to a new record. And Q3 equity volumes also increased, up 65% year-over-year to a three-year high. And this is even before the full rollout of index options Futures and Robinhood Legend. In closing, we had another strong quarter in Q3, and you should know, our team continues to work incredibly hard to deliver even more value to our customers. The roadmap is full, there's so much to do, and we're excited to share a lot more with you at our Investor Day in December. Now, let's move to questions. Yeah, thank you for the question. I think that the first thing I want to say is we've really been humbled by the demand we've seen so far for the Gold credit card. The waitlist is close to 2 million, and so far we've rolled it out to about 100,000 customers. And I think if you compare this to how other successful credit card programs that are new have scaled, that's a pretty quick ramp. But of course, we also recognize it's small compared to the waitlist. The waitlist, frankly, exceeded our expectations, and we're working as hard as we can to get it out as quickly as we can. But it's also important for us to make sure we don't incur significant near-term losses. So we have to understand the customer behavior and the economics because the credit card business can get quite big. And also, if we're not careful, that could mean losses. So as I mentioned earlier, we like the behavior we're seeing. And if the behavior we're seeing continues in this way, over the next year we expect to roll the card out to multiples of where we are today. Yeah, we've actually experimented with this in the past when we rolled out Robinhood Spending and the Robinhood Cash Card a couple years ago. Now, right now the focus is really on the credit card offering. We're seeing amazing feedback and strong demand for that. So we're focusing on making sure we scale that. But we do anticipate growing our offerings so that anything that you can do on another consumer finance app or product can be done on Robinhood as well. So this is certainly something that we're thinking about. Yeah. So the strategy with gold is to deliver an offering that provides customers with exceptional value in every market environment, regardless of whether the rates are increasing or decreasing. You should be able to get tremendous value from Robinhood Gold. Now, some of the value props naturally do well in an increasing rate environment. Cash sweep with high APY is one of them. Other products tend to be more attractive in declining rate environments. And as a matter of fact, at Hood Summit, we recently announced that gold customers will receive differentiated better pricing on a few of the products we announced. So the pricing, while industry-leading across the board is even better on index options and futures for our gold subscribers. So while rates on sweeps may be coming down because of Fed cuts, we're going to keep investing in gold. And for every new product we launch, we ask ourselves, how can we make it even better for our gold subscribers? And as you see, as we continue to roll out new products, gold should get even better and better. We think it's really good. Yeah. I think you're going to like it. Yeah, I mean, we are still, the product is not quite ungated in the sense that anyone can just access it. So we've been rolling out to multiples of that number, but haven't yet sort of like opened it up to everyone. Early feedback is extremely positive. I mean, I don't know, you guys probably see the level of live streamers and folks on social media has been tremendous. And the team is, I'd say, even more motivated to keep the momentum and make sure the product is better and better because we really feel like we've got something great here. Thanks, Dan. Yeah. So first off, we just rolled out to 100% of customers after starting the rollout just this Monday. So huge kudos to the team for that. The path to offer this product was paved really less than 30 days ago. And we really moved quickly to make it available to customers ahead of the election. So to give a little bit of context around this, one of our focus areas is to win the active trader market. And I think really to do that, our approach is that if you're an active trader, using Robinhood should put you in a position, you should really associate Robinhood with being at the forefront of technology and innovation and trading. And I think offering products like these, which you can't really find at many of our competitors is the best way to do that. So feedback is really, really good. You can see on social that it's resonating with customers very, very clearly. But we rolled out to 100% right before the call started. So I think it's a little bit early to tell to give you too much. Other than yesterday, we did about 10 million contracts. That was pre-full rollout. And we've done even more than that already today. We can take the next one. Yeah. I would say that the folks that use the Robinhood Legend product tend to be among our most active. So, the velocity is quite high. That being said, we rolled it out to 1,000 people during the Robinhood Legend keynote and it was the first 1,000 people that sort of like signed into their Robinhood accounts on desktop. And I think we filled the 1,000 slots in 45 seconds. So, those customers were very keen and engaged to try the product. Early feedback is very positive. And I think it's really important to establish a great reputation among active traders because they're networked in a way. They talk to each other, they listen to other active traders and what we've been seeing is really positive signs from the community about Robinhood Legend. But that said, it's not rolled out fully yet, so we don't have the perfect picture of what it's going to look like at 100%, but so far we really like what we're seeing. Yeah, timing on index options and futures. So, the first Robinhood derivatives product that rolled out is our presidential election market. Futures Outrights will probably be rolled out in the coming months, but right now the focus of the futures business is really just making sure everything goes as smoothly as possible for the election next week. And then, of course, rolling out Outrights is a top priority. Index options as well coming in the coming months. Great. Yes. We can hear you now. Yeah. I think that it really depends on the product we're talking about. I mean, for example, just this week with presidential election market, we started the rollout on Monday and completed it on Wednesday, which is very quick particularly for a new product. Credit card is a little bit of a different animal. I mean, nothing technological is preventing us from rolling that out. It's just really looking at other successful credit card programs in the past and making sure that with a wait list of 2 million customers that business could get quite big. But if we don't manage it carefully, losses could get big as well. So to avoid that, we want to make sure we prudently scale it. And so far, we've onboarded about 100,000 customers who love it and early signs are good. And that's roughly in line with how fast other successful card programs have scaled in kind of like the first year of operations. So that one, it's just us making sure that we're understanding customer behavior, understanding credit, since that's a new business for us. And we're feeling good. But yeah, we recognize the demand is extreme. So we're working to onboard people as quickly as possible. And we expect to get to multiples of our current level over the next year. Yeah, I feel really good about that relationship, Steven. I mean, one way to think about it is just bridging revenue from Q2 to Q3. There's really two things that distinguish our second quarter and our third quarter. The first is in the second quarter, we have seasonally high proxy revenue. That was about $30 million, and you saw that reduction in Q3 as we moved past that seasonal quarter. The second bridge item from Q2 to Q3 is the contra revenues on the match promotions. And in the quarter, we saw a step up to $27 million. That was an increase of about $14 million in contra revenues versus Q2. And I think that's showing up in the relationship that you're drawing to AUC. Importantly, most of the incremental $14 million related to the 1% boost on gold deposits, and that's something that we're winding down in November. So as we look forward to Q4, we expect Q4 to step up contra revenues in a similar amount that we saw from Q2 to Q3, but then subside and grow at a slower rate. Zooming out, I feel really good longer term about the core business. Yeah. I'd say overall, as a philosophy, we want to make all product categories available for customers over time, particularly for active traders. We want Robinhood to be associated with being at the frontier of innovation and technology in financial services. So if you look specifically at these event contracts, they're regulated swaps markets that really serve as legitimate hedging instruments for large institutions. And we believe that if any tool or any instrument is available for institutions, then we have to make it available for retail as well. I think a nice other secondary impact is it provides people with a reliable data source about where predictions, where people predict the market will land. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you to everyone for listening and to our institutional and retail analysts for continuing to engage. And really, a special thank you to all the folks on social media who've been posting content and streaming using Robinhood Legend and sharing feedback. We really appreciate it."

            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Vlad, and thanks everyone for joining us today. In Q3, we had another strong quarter, growing revenues 36% and driving 77% incremental adjusted EBITDA margins versus a year ago. Q3 business results also set a number of new highs, including assets under custody, options contracts, cash suite balances, and retirement AUC, as well as multi-year highs for equity volumes and margin balances. And as we enter 2024 focused on driving another year of profitable growth, we're excited that we've already broken records for full-year revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share. Looking at the progress we made in Q3 versus a year ago. Assets under custody grew 76% to a record $152 billion. Net deposits were $10 billion plus for the third straight quarter and $39 billion over the past year. This translates to annualized net deposit growth rates of 29% in Q3 and 45% over the past year. Total net revenues grew 36% to $637 million. Adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled to $268 million. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 13 points to 42% and net income grew to $150 million or $0.17 per share. This was reduced by one cent for a regulatory accrual in the quarter. We're pleased with these results which mark our fourth straight quarter of GAAP profitability and ninth straight quarter positive adjusted EBITDA. Now let's look more closely at Q3 revenues which increased year-over-year across all three categories. Transaction based revenues grew 72% as we drove higher volumes and market share gains across all trading products. It was great to see option, equity and crypto volumes up 47%, 65% and over 100% from a year ago respectively. Net interest revenues increased 9% as we grew interest earning assets and securities lending activity improved. This included customers growing their cash suite balances 80% year-over-year and margin balances building to a two year high. Lastly, other revenues grew by 42% as we added over 850,000 gold subscribers in the past year to reach a record 2.2 million subscribers and record annualized recurring gold subscription revenue of over $110 million. I'd also note that our Q3 revenues include the impact of contra revenues from amortizing matches on customer deposits and transfers. Q3 contra revenues were $27 million up $14 million sequentially, mostly driven by the 1% gold deposit boost. We expect contra revenues to grow sequentially by a similar amount in Q4 and then grow much slower in 2025. To provide some more context, customers love the matches we provide on asset transfers and IRA contributions and we're seeing great payback periods on these matches. At the same time, the 1% gold deposit boost has not driven as much incremental customer activity as our other promotions. So we've decided to wind it down in November to focus on offers that resonate more with customers. As an example, we doubled down recently for our hood week promotion by offering a range of matches on asset transfers. And in just two weeks, this led to $2 billion of transfers in from brokerage incumbents that averaged over $130,000 per customer. Stepping back, when we reflect on our revenue so far this year, it feels good that our last three quarters are the three highest in company history. Turning to Q3 expenses, we had another good quarter of expense discipline. Combined adjusted OpEx and SBC was $476 million in Q3 in the middle of our \u201824 outlook range on a quarterly basis. Looking ahead to Q4, we're pleased that we're still on track for our full year outlook range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion of adjusted OpEx and SBC, even while driving nearly 40% year-over-year revenue growth for the first three quarters of the year. We anticipate we'll likely finish near the top end of that range given our continued growth investments to finish the year strong. Turning to capital management, we started our 1 billion share repurchase program in July. We allocated 97 million to repurchase 5 million shares in Q3 and made good initial progress on our expected two to three year total timeline. We love deploying capital like this. It lowers our share count and positions us to increase EPS and free cash flow per share over time. And when we look at last year's share repurchase, plus the start of our new program, we've deployed over $700 million to repurchase approximately 60 million of our shares, equivalent to about 7% of our current diluted count. And we're continuing to repurchase shares daily in Q4. Before passing it back to Vlad, I'd like to comment on the strong momentum we are seeing so far in October. Net deposits are north of $4 billion, and cash suite balances are more than 25 billion. As for trading, equity notional volumes highest month in over three years. Option contracts look to be one of the highest months ever and crypto notional volumes are over $5 billion on track to exceed the Q3 monthly average. I'd also highlight that our crypto rebates have increased to 48 basis points in October relative to our 44 basis point average in Q3 and 35 basis points at the start of the year strong. Longer term, we're energized by the progress we're making and believe we are well positioned to drive higher earnings and free cash flow per share over time, driven by our 20% plus net deposit growth, diversified business model and 90% fixed cost base. With that, I'll turn the call back to Vlad. Sure. There's a couple things I'd highlight on tax management. First of all, we recognize it's really important for customers. Just yesterday, we announced a realized P&L tool shipped. So that one's live for customers now. And we also know that tax lot selection in the app is important for customers. And I'm excited to tell you that we have employee beta testing going on right now for tax lots. And the team is pushing hard to get it in the hands of customers really soon. Sure, Patrick. I'll go ahead and take both of those. This is Jason. So just going index options first, the non-gold price will be industry leading at $0.50 per contract and the gold price will be even better at $0.35 per contract. Cash settled index options, as you know, is a really fast growing segment within options. And so we see this as a big opportunity for us to take market share even faster. As context, we have been taking double digit market share for some time now and that's without having this hotter segment offer. Also on fees, like exchange fees, we'll be passing those through to the customers. On futures, non-gold, $0.75 per contract and gold gets an even better deal at $0.50 per contract. We've said that futures over time, based on volumes we've seen at our competitors. We think it could be a nine figure business for us. So big opportunity for us. The second part of your question was equity take rates. There's really two things that affect our take rate on equity. The first is volatility and the second is mix. And what we saw in the quarter was just customers buying more larger, more liquid names. Yeah, you bet. And the rate times the balance, again, this quarter would be roughly $40 million for each rate cut. On margin, we've been seeing really nice growth in margin balances following the reduction of rates for customers. That's continued into October. So, that's been moving up. We'll share that number with you here in a couple of weeks. In terms of SEC lending, a couple of dynamics going on there. First, on just the business inputs themselves, we had about 400,000 additional customers join the program this year and several billion in equities added to the program, which is great for the long-term viability of that program. At the same time, we saw rates on specials that we get hard to borrows, come down a bit versus Q2. And I think that's really what you're seeing. But in terms of the underlying business drivers, we feel really good about that. And then lastly, we've talked about for some time about how we think we have a naturally hedged business model that as rates come down, we see interest rates turn into a tail wind for the business around growth. I think you've already started to see some of that with the trading activity, options at an all-time high in Q3, equities hitting a multi-year high. So, I'm feeling even more confident about the tailwinds that come from falling rates. And we'll just have to see how it plays out from here. Yeah, I'll go ahead and take both of those. So first on the crypto rebates, we've been experimenting for some time on crypto rebates and we've been seeing the rebate rate come up. We always want to have great prices for customers, but also balance the return that we generate for shareholders on that activity. And so we started the year at about 35 basis points and you've seen it move up, including in October where we're running at 48 basis points. In terms of futures and index options, those products really benefit from the broader technology structure that we have at the company. We have roughly 90% fixed costs base and relatively low variable costs and futures and index options benefit from that as well, which leads to really high incremental margins as we grow those businesses. Yeah, we love the matches on deposits. We've seen customers really respond to it. From a finance perspective, we track the behavior of the cohorts and dollars that come in, and we've seen, for example, the 2023 match promotions have already paid off. The payback periods are around one year for 1% and kind of in the two to three year zone, trending more towards three years on the retirement matches that are 3%. So we feel really, really good about that. It's our third straight quarter of $10 billion plus in net deposits from our customers and continuing with a longer term trend of 20% plus growth. The Hood Week promotions that we did brought in $2 billion. So that was a two-week promotion and really, really strong response from customers. And in addition to the relatively quick payback periods, we just love the potential for compounding the facts for the business over time."

After the speaker presentation, it will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Chris Koegel, VP of Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.\nChris Koegel : Thank you, Lateef, And thank you to everyone for joining Robinhood's Q2 Earnings Call. With us today are CEO and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I just want to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor are described in the press release we issued today, the earnings presentation, and our SEC filings, all of which can be found at investors.robinhood.com. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev : Thanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. Let me start with the three things Robinhood is focused on. Number 1, winning the active trader market. Number 2, increasing wallet share with our customers. And number 3, expanding internationally. We are making progress across all three of these. And in Q2, we delivered another quarter of strong outcomes and several financial records. More specifically, our retail trading market share continued to increase, leading to year-over-year growth in equity option and crypto volumes. Net deposits were a new record of $13 billion in the quarter, translating to a 41% annualized growth rate. With $11 billion in Q1, we've already exceeded our long-term annual target of 20% plus, and we're only halfway through the year. Gold subscribers reached a record 2 million, which is over 60% year-over-year growth, and now over 8% of funded customers are gold members. And these results, combined with continued expense discipline, drove 40% year-over-year revenue growth to a record $682 million as well as record EPS of $0.21. There's still so much to do, so we're not slowing down. On the active trader front, we've been consistently growing our market share among equities and options, but until recently, one area where candidly our progress has not been so great is margin. And this is a huge opportunity for us as brokerage incumbents generate far more revenue on margin than even trading. In particular, we were not getting much adoption from customers with larger margin balances because our rates were not very competitive. So we introduced industry leading rates for active traders in May. And this, coupled with the continued improvements we are making to the accounts transfers flow, led margin balances to grow by over 20% in the last five weeks of the quarter to a two-year high of $5 billion. Now 75% of that growth came from customers with margin balances over $100,000. So we're really pleased with the progress we're making on margin with our large active customers. And we're continuing to see strong margin balance growth in Q3. Finally, we're nowhere close to being done building for active traders. There's plenty more coming, including our inaugural Hood Summit in October. We have a lot of positive feedback from our gold event in March. So we decided to host a special event just for our active traders. And this will be much bigger than the gold event. We'll be launching some awesome new products that we can't wait to tell you about. Now, let me turn it over to Jason to review our financial results, and then I'll offer some additional thoughts.\nJason Warnick : Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. As we discussed last quarter, we are focused on driving another year of profitable growth and in Q2 we continue to make good progress. We drove new highs in revenues, adjusted EBITDA, net income, and GAAP EPS in Q2. Compared to a year ago, total net revenues grew 40% to $682 million. Adjusted EBITDA roughly doubled to $301 million. Incremental margins were 77%. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 13 points to 44%, as we make progress over time towards the 50% plus levels comparable to what we see from incumbent brokerage firms. And net income was $188 million, or $0.21 per share, up 7 times from a year ago. And taking a look at the past year, it's great to see how a number of strong quarters came together. For the last 12 months, revenues were over $2.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA was over $800 million, both new highs. We're pleased with these results as we aim to continue delivering profitable growth in 2024. Now let's move to Q2 business results. Assets under custody finished Q2 at a record $140 billion, up 57% year-over-year. A key driver of that asset growth was record Q2 net deposits of over $13 billion, which translates to a 41% annualized growth rate. It's also great to see how assets continue to diversify. Retirement AUC was nearly $9 billion in Q2, more than doubling from last quarter. And cash sweep balances were a record $21 billion in Q2, up 76% year-over-year. We're also driving growth in Robinhood Gold, which continues to deliver value to both our customers and our shareholders. As a reminder, gold subscribers on average are 7 times larger than our customers overall, have been growing net deposits twice as fast, and adopt products at higher rates, leading to gold ARPU that is over 7 times our customer average. In Q2, we grew gold subscribers to 2 million, up over 60% year-over-year. This represents an adoption rate of 8.2% of customers, up from 5.3% a year ago. We are excited to see continued momentum in our gold program, which now includes annualized recurring subscription revenue of over $100 million. Now let's turn to our financial results, starting with Q2 revenues compared to last quarter. Transaction-based revenues were roughly flat as equities and options increased while crypto revenues declined with industry volumes. Net interest revenues grew due to higher securities lending activity and higher interest earning asset balances and other revenues increased driven by proxy seasonality and continued growth in Robinhood gold. Turning the second quarter expenses, combined adjusted OpEx and SBC was $493 million in Q2, this includes increased employee bonus accruals given the strong start we've had to the year, as well as some costs related to our two recently announced acquisitions, Bitstamp and Pluto. All in, through the first half of the year, our expenses are on track with the middle of our full year outlook range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. So we're keeping our outlook unchanged and we'll continue actively managing our expenses based on the returns we see on our growth investments, as well as the macro environment. Before I pass the call back to Vlad, I want to share some perspectives about how we are thinking about capital deployment. When we think about capital allocation, our primary objective is to maximize earnings and free cash flow per share over time. We do this by allocating capital to organic growth and M&A to drive earnings and free cash flow higher. And we complement that with share repurchases that can increase the value per share. And in Q2, we made good progress. First, we continued to invest in organic growth in areas like product development, marketing, and customer matches. We have a lot of momentum and I like the economics we're driving. Second, we announced two acquisitions. In June, we signed an agreement to acquire Bitstamp, a global crypto exchange. We believe it will accelerate our crypto roadmap, enabling us to serve a broader user base, enhance our capabilities, and provide additional liquidity for crypto trading. Additionally, we acquired Pluto to help us move even faster in AI and advisory. We're excited to share more as we make progress here. And finally, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which we started executing in July and currently expect to execute over a two year to three year period. This timeline could vary depending on market conditions and other capital allocation opportunities. Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to drive higher earnings and free cash flow per share over time, driven by our 20% plus [net deposit] (ph) growth, naturally hedged business model, and 90% fixed cost base. And we have a lot of momentum entering the second half of the year, as our business is having a great start to Q3. As context, June was a strong month with nearly record options volume, close to a 24-month high for equities volume, and over $4 billion of net deposits. And in July, trading volumes were more than 20% higher than June across equities, options, and crypto. And net deposits were again over $4 billion. While August is just getting started, so far it looks a lot like July, including over $1 billion of net deposits in the first week of August. With that, I'll turn the call back to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev : Thanks Jason. As I said earlier, the second part of our strategy is increasing wallet share with customers, including growing Robinhood Gold subscriptions, which hit an all-time high in Q2. And we've been busy rolling out additional value for Robinhood Gold customers, including a 1% unlimited deposit boost and a new Gold credit card with 3% cash back. Now I've talked before about how we've been seeing the flywheel accelerate and I thought I would explain in a little bit more detail how it works. So here it goes. First, our gold members receive industry leading economics in a world-class customer experience across all of our products and services. This leads to double the net deposit growth and higher multi-product adoption, including retirement adoption that's five times that of average customers. And as the flywheel spins, it leads to greater customer loyalty and ARPU that's over 7 times that of our average customer. And this leads to faster gold member growth at a better ROI. The different components of the flywheel are self-reinforcing, leading to higher customer satisfaction, higher revenues, and greater diversification for our business over time. So we had a strong Q2, and you should know our team's been working incredibly hard to deliver even more value to our customers. Roadmap is full, there is so much to do, now let's move to questions.\nA - Chris Koegel: Thank you, Vlad. For the Q&A session, we'll start by answering the top few shareholder questions from Say Technologies ranked by number of votes. We passed over questions that have already been answered on this call or in prior quarters and grouped together questions that shared a common theme. After the Say questions, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So I'll kick it off with our first question from Say. The first question is, When are you rolling out the credit cards?\nVlad Tenev: Thank you. And thanks to Chandler, the question asker. So we started rolling out the credit card a few months ago, and we recently announced that we have crossed 50,000 cardholders. And we recognize the demand for the credit card is high. And the feedback that we've gotten so far from customers is also very, very positive. People love the card, customers love the rewards. They love everything about it, the in-app experience, the digital experience, the card itself. The app so far has a 5.0 Rating on the App Store with over 7,000 reviews. So there is a lot of demand to roll it out faster. Just to set the context, if you compare the rollout of our credit card with other successful card programs in the past, we are kind of right on track, rolling it out at the same rate roughly in Year 1. And these programs tend to start off a little bit more slowly as the unit economics are validated and the customer activity around borrowing and spending is validated as well. So we recognize that there is a ton of demand. Part of that is also because people are seeing the card in the wild and seeing the positive reviews. And we want to build that demand, but we're going to be prudent and make sure we do it while carefully managing the risks of any new business.\nChris Koegel: Right. Thank you, Vlad. The next question asks, can we get more information on the AI company that you just acquired?\nVlad Tenev: Yes, absolutely. I will take this one as well. We're really excited about Pluto. They're an AI-powered investment research platform, and the team is really, really great. And in terms of what we plan to do with the team and the technology, we think they can help us accelerate the work we are doing both in AI and in advisory. And we have got some really good stuff in the works there. So stay tuned.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. And then the last question from Say. Do you ever plan on releasing a desktop version of Robinhood with more in-depth chart analysis capabilities?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. As a matter of fact, this is one of the top things that we've been focused on this year. And we've been actually we've been actually making sure that the platform is very, very good. I've seen some demos of it and the demos are looking great. And I think it is going to be an amazing product that customers will love. So stay tuned. We can't wait to share it with you guys.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thanks, Vlad. That concludes our shareholder questions from Say Technologies. We appreciate our shareholders taking time to ask these questions to Vlad and Jason and look forward to more next quarter. Now I will turn the call back over to Latif to lead Q&A from our analysts.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Dolev of Mizuho.\nDan Dolev: Hi, Vlad. Hi guys. Really good results here. Really amazing results here as always. I want to know about all the growth you are seeing in the 24 hour markets and can you give me some color on the outage from earlier this week because we've got a lot of questions about it? Thank you and great stuff.\nVlad Tenev: Yes, yes. I will field that one. And thank you, Dan. So about 24-hour market, I first want to say that with this product, we are on the bleeding edge of technology in trading, this product is not commonly available with such a large instrument base to customers. And with any new product, there is some -- sometimes things don't go exactly right. In this particular case, the third-party ATS that we route orders to, which is called Blue Ocean ATS, had some technology issues, they couldn't handle the extreme demand this Sunday. And they had to shut down, and this is disappointing for customers. I mean we've had our share of scaling pains in the past. This time, it is a third-party, which is nonetheless, very, very frustrating. But we've been working with the team over at Blue Ocean, making sure that we are being as helpful as possible in them scaling their infrastructure, helping them with testing and we are confident that they\u2019ve a testing and scaling plan in place that will allow us to release this product safely and handle much larger load across all the symbols we offer. And I think that is planning to be instituted over -- in the next week or so. I should also mention, 24-hour market has been incredibly successful, and that's partly the cause of all this attention. We are nearing $30 billion in volumes since launch in the overnight hours, and we are really excited because this product is one of the reasons why we believe that customers would be advantaged on Robinhood and they would have access that they wouldn't have on other platforms. So we are going to continue to invest in it. As with any product on the bleeding edge of innovation, you should expect the reliability and the quality to improve consistently over time. And we're going to make sure we continue to work with our partners, including Blue Ocean so that we can deliver that for you all.\nDan Dolev: Amazing momentum. Thanks again.\nVlad Tenev : Thanks Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Steven.\nSteven Chubak: Vlad, Jason, and Chris, good afternoon. Hope you are well? I wanted to start off with a question just on a bigger picture one, the crypto strategy. There's been some speculation that we could get some improved regulatory clarity on the crypto side, especially with the change in administration. I was just hoping you could speak to the incremental revenue opportunity or how the strategy might evolve from expanding your crypto offering, whether it is adding additional coins, staking or lending? And specific to the quarter, what drove the higher crypto take rate in 2Q?\nJason Warnick: I'll go ahead and start. It is Jason here, and Vlad can contribute with his thoughts as well. So in terms of what the implications would be of improved regulatory environment for crypto, I think what that would do is really allow us to innovate more rapidly and bring more to market what customers would like to see in crypto. And in the current situation, we are able to do that more in the EU than we are in the US. And I know that can be frustrating for our customers. And so I think you hit on some of the top things. We'd be able to offer more coins. And certainly, there's a wide selection of coins that because of the regulatory environment, we're not comfortable listing today. We'd also be able to innovate in new products and services, things like lending and taking and bring that to market. So in terms of the revenue opportunity, I mean I think for tokens, you could just estimate looking at share of market and overall industry volumes as they are traded in other platforms here in the US and abroad, as well as the other services that we don't yet offer. So I think it could be meaningful, and we are continuing to work with our regulators to gain that clarity.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. And I would just add that, of course, clarity is good and we believe the US needs to be a leader in crypto, and we will get the clarity here in the domestic market. We haven't felt constrained by this with regard to our crypto business. We've been really happy at the speed of execution and innovation. Of course, we built a system that offers different products, Solana staking, more asset selection in the EU. In the US, there is plenty of work to do, and we believe we can be successful regardless of what administration ultimately ends up taking power in November or if it's the same one. We've done a lot of work to innovate on pricing. And you've seen year-over-year increases in market share and volumes of our crypto business as well. So there's plenty of work to do.\nJason Warnick: The second part of your question, Steven was around take rates. And so in the quarter, the crypto take rate was 38 bps. That's up 3 bps quarter-over-quarter. That's really due to pricing experiments. Looking at Q3 and July, the crypto take rates were in the low $0.40 range. And we'll see how we go from there. But we continue to offer great pricing to customers and are excited to see how the quarter plays out.\nSteven Chubak: That's great color. And if I could just squeeze in one more just on the rate outlook. Fed futures, now pricing in four additional cuts, since the last earnings call. It might be helpful if you could just speak to the sensitivity to rate cuts or provide an update. But also what are some of the potential offsets that you envisage on the revenue side that could help mitigate some of that pressure on [NII] (ph)?\nJason Warnick: Sure. I'll take that one. So first of all, we've got a lot of experience operating in different rate environments, high rate environments, low rate environments. One thing that we really like about our business is the natural offset between rates and trading. So as rates fall, asset values and trading tend to increase. And overall, lower rates tend to be a tailwind for growth for our business. I think there is a couple of important things to call out. First, we've been growing our interest-earning assets at a really nice pace. But not all of our interest earning assets are sensitive to rate changes. So actually, over half of the balance of interest earning assets relates to our cash sweep and the spread we earn there is relatively fixed, which minimizes the impact of changes in rates. Second, we are broadening the way that we serve our customers. And that\u2019s leading to a much more diversified business for us. Specific to the question you asked about what the rate impact is, so assuming a 25 basis point change or decline that would affect NIM by $40 million. And hard to predict the exact timing, but we feel good about the natural hedge. We have $1 billion of transaction-based revenue, and it takes a relatively small uptick in trading activity to offset that decline in interest.\nSteven Chubak : That\u2019s great color. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nJason Warnick : You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you're all doing well. So my question is on big picture organic growth. This was the second quarter in a row that your total organic growth has exceeded 40% annualized. Now there's a lot of drivers in there like the matching efforts but some of your initiatives like the UK brokerage and Europe crypto are very early innings. So we wanted to get your potential -- your thoughts on the potential organic growth rate in the second half just given all the moving pieces. So is 40% sustainable?\nJason Warnick: So we have a long track record of 20% plus organic growth rate, and we have a really strong first half of the year, as you pointed out. I think what I can say that would be helpful here is that that's continuing so far into Q3. We are seeing an incredibly strong July with activity across the three trading categories up 20% over the June levels, and we are seeing that continue in August. So over $4 billion of net deposits in July and over $1 billion in the first week of August. So all signs at this point in the quarter are showing that our customers continue to engage with us, continue to deposit their money with us. And I think as Vlad mentioned, we now have eight businesses where the annualized revenue run rate is over $100 million. And so we are much more diversified today than we were even just a couple of years ago, and I think very well positioned, especially as we continue innovating for customers and rolling out new products. to continue driving outsized organic growth.\nVlad Tenev: And I just want to emphasize one other thing I mentioned earlier in the remarks which is that we haven't really taken the lid off of the new active trader products. Our active trader business is the most mature and investments that we make there have the most immediate impact on our business, relative to our investments growing wallet share and also internationally. And we've got an event for our active traders in October, where we are going to unveil some new products. And I think we are getting very, very excited about it. So those results that you are seeing, I mean there -- they're good results. We're proud of them, but I think we have plenty of room to run on the active trader side, and that includes margin, but it also includes new product innovations that we've been [baking] (ph) for the majority of the year.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Vlad. that's great to hear. On the innovation side, I think there's still a few product gaps versus some of the more established online brokers. And I'm thinking like custody mutual funds fixed income products, CDs. Now you do have ACAT functionality now and I think that helps. But can you provide us an update on some of the near-term product gaps that you can fill?\nVlad Tenev: Yes. Well, what I'll tell you is that on the active trader front, we've talked a lot about futures. We've talked a lot about how we're great on mobile, but there's a lot of existing customers that need the more power of a web interface and a desktop interface. So they can take advantage of extra screen real estate and use better tools and charting. So those are gaps in a way, but also opportunities for us to really differentiate and innovate and jump ahead of what we've seen elsewhere. I think regarding more sort of like passive buy-and-hold assets like CDs and mutual funds, we are climbing the capability curve with our ACAT transfers product and we made a ton of progress just this year, making the process of moving assets into Robinhood as easy as possible. I think that's really led to some of the bottom-line results that you're seeing, including net positive account transfers from every major incumbent brokerage firm for several quarters running now. And the goal would be to actually accelerate that over time. We see plenty of opportunity we want to remove reasons that customers have for withdrawing, and we think we can systematically reduce reasons for withdrawals over the long run and also increased reasons for customers to deposit. And so this is one thing we're really focused on, and it's going to take some time to play out. But I think you should see that reflect over the long run and increased net deposit activity. We're going to go through and add all of the assets that are missing. We are going to add all the capabilities and then we\u2019re going to make sure the process of transferring is better at Robinhood than anywhere else. And then the incentives that we offer because of our economics are just kind of the cherry on top that I think will really accelerate asset growth into the platform. So I\u2019m getting \u2013 there\u2019s so much to do here and we\u2019re just at the beginning. And we only started offering incoming ACATs in the past couple of years, and we\u2019ve already made a ton of progress here.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan of Citizens JMP.\nDevin Ryan: Hi good afternoon Vlad, Jason. Great quarter. Question, would love to just dig in a little bit around how you guys are thinking about the incremental margin potential from here over the intermediate term. So obviously already at a mid-40% EBITDA margin, 90% of the current expense base is fixed. And I know 50% plus is the objective, but you really aren't that far away from 50%. So just love to think about like what the ceiling looks like here? Is there one because you have such an efficient tech stack infrastructure? And then is there anything on the road map that could drive a material acceleration in fixed expenses from the core base? I'm just trying to think about kind of where we could go, I know what the targets are, but just the algorithm? Thanks.\nJason Warnick: Yes. I view kind of the 50%, Devin, is more of a way station on our path to the longer-term margins. You've seen us drive substantial incremental margins over the last few years. This quarter it was 77%. And it's really a reflection of us driving up revenue and managing our costs closely. I think a good analogy to how we're thinking about cost long term is looking at what we did in 2024. We looked at our existing businesses and held those businesses to a low single digit and in some cases, negative OpEx growth rate. And we use those savings to help fund specific growth investments for the business. And there are many that we've been talking about and alluding to on this call, and we set aside an extra $100 million in marketing budget. And all of that translated to operating expense guidance that was up 5% at the midpoint, which we continue to reiterate. And so I think we have a lot of opportunity to see continuing leverage in our existing business. And then you are going to see us on top of that, continue to make very targeted high expected ROI investments for growth. In terms of things that are out there on the road map, it's too early to give specific guidance. The one thing I'd point to is we are rolling out a credit card. And as Vlad talked about, we are being very patient in the short term in the way that we approach that, but that will certainly be some incremental investments next year. But well, stay tuned for a specific guidance on next year.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. The only thing that I would add to that, which I think is interesting is I think we've talked a lot -- you hear a lot about AI and the impact on different sorts of companies. I think one area that we maybe haven't emphasized as much is how we've been making use of that operationally, including for engineering. And as we look at kind of the core engine of our business, we are creating software, we're rolling out products to companies and our business even though we're in financial services, is technology at its core. And we've seen a lot of impact in applying these AI tools on the engineering side, just making different parts of software development process easier and simpler. That's an area we're investing a lot in. And I think there is a lot of room to run. We've already seen significant productivity gains in the past year, and we think we're just -- we're closer to the beginning than to the maturation point of that cycle.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley of Piper Sandler.\nPatrick Moley : Yeah, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. So I had one on the Gold offering. You've added a number of things over the last few quarters. You're planning to add more before the end of the year with the web-based platform and options and futures trading or index options and futures trading, rather. Just talk to us about your thoughts on pricing here. You're at $5 a month now. What's the appetite to go higher? And how do you kind of balance that pricing dynamic with your desire to kind of continue to grow that subscriber base? Thanks.\nJason Warnick: Yes, I'll go ahead and take this one. What I'd say is our focus right now is increasing the adoption rate of our customers in gold, and we are doing that by just continuing to invest in the Gold program and we love the economics. I mean it is great that we have the subscription revenue that's north of $100 million annually, but it leads to downstream effects, higher adoption faster net deposits and 7 times the ARPU. And so we are not feeling pressured in the short term to raise the price. It is something that we will continue to look at. And we don't have religion that we wouldn't touch the price over time. But right now, it's not the top priority.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt of KBW.\nKyle Voigt : Hi, good evening. Maybe a question on margin balances. So you know that the impact of cutting your margin rates and the subsequent margin balance growth of 20%. I guess is there any way you can disaggregate how much of that growth is coming from existing Robinhood margin clients simply utilizing margin more versus maybe customers where you know they were utilizing margin elsewhere and has simply transferred or switch that activity to Robinhood? And if there is some of that switching that's happening, can you comment on if the customer margin inflows have generally been from one firm or broad-based for retail brokers across the industry?\nJason Warnick: Yes. I'll go ahead and take this. So it's mostly from existing customers, but we are seeing both existing as well as new customers take advantage of the lower margin rates. And we continue to see this grow in July. We talk about one of our top three strategic pillars is to be Number #1 in active trading. And as Vlad mentioned, we've made a lot of progress on market share for both equities and options and overall or number two, in active trading for those categories for trading, but we are a distant fifth in market share in margins. So it\u2019s a huge opportunity for us. We just lowered the rates in May, and we saw the 20% move to the end of the quarter, that\u2019s continuing in July. And we think that this is a really big opportunity, and we\u2019re definitely starting to take share there. We grew much faster than our peers in the second quarter, even with the May change in the rates.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.\nMike Cyprys : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to ask for a little bit more color and update on the international expansion efforts, in particular in the UK, in Europe and around the world. Just curious what sort of traction you're seeing so far what steps are you looking to take here in the second half and into 2025 in order to accelerate growth? And as you think about and look around building out the platform overseas, just curious what challenges you face versus having built out the business in the US, and how you are looking to overcome some of those hurdles? Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll field that. In a nutshell, we like the early signs that we are seeing. So far, account balances overseas are a little bit smaller than the US on average, but the trading characteristics are pretty similar. And what we really like is as we hear from customers, both in the UK for brokerage and in the EU for crypto, they want things that we offer in the U.S. So UK customers are requesting margin and options and EU customers are requesting the ability to trade stocks. So that I think, validates in part our strategy of expanding with one unified platform internationally. And having the same technology be available in as many markets worldwide as possible. So our focus really is rounding out the feature set in the UK and in the EU, making sure that all of the great products that we have available in the US can be made available there. And that involves working with the relevant regulators in these jurisdictions, taking them along and giving their customers access to all of these awesome products, we feel really, really good about that. And then simultaneously, we are looking into expanding to other jurisdictions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro of Needham.\nJohn Todaro: Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter results here. I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the [bps stance] (ph). They offer a number of crypto offerings and then also the trading payers. This first part of that is, do you anticipate growing products with that acquisition in the US? Or are you still a little bit hamstrung on regulation that is the deciding factor? And then just two within that, Bitstamp historically has had higher trading fees than hud? Do you think those fees on the platform could kind of go higher as we saw take rate going higher here? Or should we not read into that same piece?\nVlad Tenev: I think there's two interesting things about the Bitstamp acquisition that you should know. One of them is international. The second one is institutional the business is a global business. It operates in a lot of jurisdictions, and we could see that accelerating our international expansion on the crypto side, significantly. And also dovetailing quite nicely with the large retail business that we currently have at Robinhood and the great product innovation that we're driving there. The other thing we are excited about is institutional business, and they have great relationships with institutions. It is an area that we believe we are well positioned to tackle because we've built great technology for consumers and institutions also want low cost for market access to crypto. And so we are really excited about the acquisition and working really closely with the team and making our joint products better and better. And I wouldn't over-index on their fee structure at this point. I'd tell you, philosophically, we want to be the market share leader, and we want to offer really competitive rates to customers. And that's kind of the North Star that Robinhood operates under. We'd rather offer low fees and due to our investments in technology and infrastructure, operate at larger scale than our competitors. So you should see us continuing to be aggressive there. But we don't have any specific -- I think it's premature to talk about like the specific changes to the fee structure at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen of Citi.\nChris Allen: Thanks for taking the question guys. I want to dig in a little bit on SEC lending, if possible. Seeing some really nice growth in the customers enrolled and the soft custody enrolled. And just maybe talk about the outlook here. Are you seeing customers enrolled putting more money to work here? Are you seeing just the momentum pick up? And just during the quarter, was there any -- how would you frame the environment from a sec lending perspective because a little slower at some of your competitors out there?\nJason Warnick: Sure. I\u2019ll go ahead and take that. I mean the primary inputs to the business are signing up more customers, and we saw a really nice pickup there, about 400,000 customers joined the program. In the quarter and the assets that are enrolled, and that increased by a little over $6 billion. So really strong inputs into the business. I thought the trading desk did a really nice job. The other input is just the rates that are available and the specific names that we call specials, where there\u2019s a higher rebate that we\u2019ll earn on lending activity. And we saw some nice attractive returns in the quarter. So I\u2019d say, the inputs and the momentum of growing that program is really strong. Trading desk is just doing a great job, and we\u2019ll have to see how the rest of the year plays out.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Neill of FT Partners.\nMatthew O'Neill: Good evening, everybody. Thanks so much for the question. Just wanted to follow up. Really, the only knit to pick here maybe was the monthly active user number, and I fully recognize the importance of that number is probably coming down over time as you diversify in some more products and some are longer term and less frequently used. But just curious if there's anything to call out maybe around crypto activity or otherwise? Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: I'll feel that and then maybe Jason will have some thoughts. What are the reasons we deemphasized monthly active users besides as you mentioned, us investing in all these diversified products like Robinhood Gold, which is a yield-based product and retirement and us not directly monetizing monthly active users yet, like we don't have an advertising business, for instance, is that it's just volatile quarter-to-quarter. And a lot of the monthly active user variation is just driven by what's going on in the crypto market. So since we're so large in retail crypto that can cause meaningful swings in monthly active users quarter-over-quarter. And that's pretty much what you see going on. When the crypto markets are hot, there is a huge immediate spike in monthly active user engagement metrics. But then when crypto cools down, that tends to drop more acutely as well. And I think that's pretty similar to what you'd see across the entire crypto market. I think that's not an idiosyncratic Robinhood phenomenon.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I'd love to get a bit more color on how the recent market sell off. has impacted your customers. You gave us some color on trading activity, but margin balances have been growing as you called out, sort of recovering with the market. but then growing with the more competitive market rates that you announced sort of going right into the sell-off. So how did Robinhood customers perform in the sell-off in August, in recent days? And can you distinguish the health of your equity sort of long-only customers given their access to leverage versus those with option capabilities where they can both hedge and speculate with options?\nJason Warnick: Yes, I'll go ahead and take this and Vlad you can add some context. So first of all, customers who are trading options and those that are using leverage tend to be are more advanced customers, and they're using a variety of trading strategies to create returns. The thing that I would point to is that we feel great about offering low price and attractive rates. And the rates that we offer on the margin book as an example, are on average, leading across the industry. And so we feel really good about that. I don't think we've shared any specifics on specific returns that individual customers are having or groups of customers. What I'll tell you is almost every time I look at the daily summary reports, when there is a sell-off our customers are buying or when prices are up, our customers are selling. And that contributes to kind of a pretty attractive return capability for customers.\nVlad Tenev: The only thing that I'd add, Ken, is there is a number of areas that we are focused on, and I outlined them in the call, one of them is being the leader in the active trader market. And I think when the goal there is when people think of Robinhood in the active trader space, they should associate us with being at the frontier of technology and innovation in trading. And I think products like 24-hour market reinforce that -- and we do have work to do, both on the product side and kind of in how we tell the story to move away from sort of this like thought that for novices. The reality is most of our customers are in their 30s, they're definitely adults and they're extremely sophisticated. And we are in a competitive market for serving this very real use case, and we're gaining market share, and it's a big part of the core business. But we also have customers that are coming to us for Robinhood Gold for our high-yield products for our awesome retirement products that has been growing assets very, very tremendously. And they're less interested in trading actively, and that's fine, too. We think that we can be a leader in wallet share, particularly for the millennial generation. And that's something that we're also focused on. There's going to be tens of trillions of assets going from baby boomers down to Gen X and Gen Y and beyond. And we are putting Robinhood in a position to be one of the, if not the primary beneficiary of that long-term shift in assets and that kind of how you're seeing the work we're doing in ACATs, diversifying the business and adding support for different assets. And so we're very excited about that, but we think we can be leaders in both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish of Barclays.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi, afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I was wondering maybe following up some your comments there, Vlad, if you could unpack a little bit the growth in options over the course of the year. What are you seeing in terms of like-for-like growth or almost the same unit or same sales, if you will? Are you seeing any stats you can share around the number of customers enabled for options? Or is it sort of the existing base sort of getting more active? And when you talk about market share, clearly your options activity as a percentage of overall industry activity is going up. What about on the customer side, to what degree do you -- the extent are you seeing customers coming to Robinhood for options or how much of the growth is coming from new customers versus increased activity from prior customers? Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. I mean, the thing I'd tell you and maybe Jason can jump into our options team has been doing a great job. We have one major advantage. I mean, several major advantages relative to what you see elsewhere in the options market. First of all, we don't charge options contract fees. So most of our competitors charge $0.65 a contract, which can add up if you're an active trader. And so purely economic perspective, you're kind of at a disadvantage if you trade options outside of Robinhood, particularly for active traders. The other area is the user experience. And we've built and announced some amazing tools in the past couple of quarters, including option simulated returns which gives people a pretty advanced analytic tool that they previously were downloading other products and paying subscription fees to get. Now that's built in with Robinhood. And we've done awesome improvements to the user experience to make it easier for customers to do the transactions that they want to do. And we've got a lot of remaining work to do. We know a lot of our customers like trading options on desktop where they get additional screen real estate and have the opportunity to do more research on platform. And so we're confident that we can keep growing that market share even further.\nJason Warnick: Yes. I would just say that the number of customers trading options are up about 25% year-over-year.\nVlad Tenev: Yes. The team has really been doing a great job.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Vlad Tenev for closing remarks. Sir?\nChris Koegel : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for listing.

            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. Let me start with the three things Robinhood is focused on. Number 1, winning the active trader market. Number 2, increasing wallet share with our customers. And number 3, expanding internationally. We are making progress across all three of these. And in Q2, we delivered another quarter of strong outcomes and several financial records. More specifically, our retail trading market share continued to increase, leading to year-over-year growth in equity option and crypto volumes. Net deposits were a new record of $13 billion in the quarter, translating to a 41% annualized growth rate. With $11 billion in Q1, we've already exceeded our long-term annual target of 20% plus, and we're only halfway through the year. Gold subscribers reached a record 2 million, which is over 60% year-over-year growth, and now over 8% of funded customers are gold members. And these results, combined with continued expense discipline, drove 40% year-over-year revenue growth to a record $682 million as well as record EPS of $0.21. There's still so much to do, so we're not slowing down. On the active trader front, we've been consistently growing our market share among equities and options, but until recently, one area where candidly our progress has not been so great is margin. And this is a huge opportunity for us as brokerage incumbents generate far more revenue on margin than even trading. In particular, we were not getting much adoption from customers with larger margin balances because our rates were not very competitive. So we introduced industry leading rates for active traders in May. And this, coupled with the continued improvements we are making to the accounts transfers flow, led margin balances to grow by over 20% in the last five weeks of the quarter to a two-year high of $5 billion. Now 75% of that growth came from customers with margin balances over $100,000. So we're really pleased with the progress we're making on margin with our large active customers. And we're continuing to see strong margin balance growth in Q3. Finally, we're nowhere close to being done building for active traders. There's plenty more coming, including our inaugural Hood Summit in October. We have a lot of positive feedback from our gold event in March. So we decided to host a special event just for our active traders. And this will be much bigger than the gold event. We'll be launching some awesome new products that we can't wait to tell you about. Now, let me turn it over to Jason to review our financial results, and then I'll offer some additional thoughts. Thanks Jason. As I said earlier, the second part of our strategy is increasing wallet share with customers, including growing Robinhood Gold subscriptions, which hit an all-time high in Q2. And we've been busy rolling out additional value for Robinhood Gold customers, including a 1% unlimited deposit boost and a new Gold credit card with 3% cash back. Now I've talked before about how we've been seeing the flywheel accelerate and I thought I would explain in a little bit more detail how it works. So here it goes. First, our gold members receive industry leading economics in a world-class customer experience across all of our products and services. This leads to double the net deposit growth and higher multi-product adoption, including retirement adoption that's five times that of average customers. And as the flywheel spins, it leads to greater customer loyalty and ARPU that's over 7 times that of our average customer. And this leads to faster gold member growth at a better ROI. The different components of the flywheel are self-reinforcing, leading to higher customer satisfaction, higher revenues, and greater diversification for our business over time. So we had a strong Q2, and you should know our team's been working incredibly hard to deliver even more value to our customers. Roadmap is full, there is so much to do, now let's move to questions. Thank you. And thanks to Chandler, the question asker. So we started rolling out the credit card a few months ago, and we recently announced that we have crossed 50,000 cardholders. And we recognize the demand for the credit card is high. And the feedback that we've gotten so far from customers is also very, very positive. People love the card, customers love the rewards. They love everything about it, the in-app experience, the digital experience, the card itself. The app so far has a 5.0 Rating on the App Store with over 7,000 reviews. So there is a lot of demand to roll it out faster. Just to set the context, if you compare the rollout of our credit card with other successful card programs in the past, we are kind of right on track, rolling it out at the same rate roughly in Year 1. And these programs tend to start off a little bit more slowly as the unit economics are validated and the customer activity around borrowing and spending is validated as well. So we recognize that there is a ton of demand. Part of that is also because people are seeing the card in the wild and seeing the positive reviews. And we want to build that demand, but we're going to be prudent and make sure we do it while carefully managing the risks of any new business. Yes, absolutely. I will take this one as well. We're really excited about Pluto. They're an AI-powered investment research platform, and the team is really, really great. And in terms of what we plan to do with the team and the technology, we think they can help us accelerate the work we are doing both in AI and in advisory. And we have got some really good stuff in the works there. So stay tuned. Yes. As a matter of fact, this is one of the top things that we've been focused on this year. And we've been actually we've been actually making sure that the platform is very, very good. I've seen some demos of it and the demos are looking great. And I think it is going to be an amazing product that customers will love. So stay tuned. We can't wait to share it with you guys. Yes, yes. I will field that one. And thank you, Dan. So about 24-hour market, I first want to say that with this product, we are on the bleeding edge of technology in trading, this product is not commonly available with such a large instrument base to customers. And with any new product, there is some -- sometimes things don't go exactly right. In this particular case, the third-party ATS that we route orders to, which is called Blue Ocean ATS, had some technology issues, they couldn't handle the extreme demand this Sunday. And they had to shut down, and this is disappointing for customers. I mean we've had our share of scaling pains in the past. This time, it is a third-party, which is nonetheless, very, very frustrating. But we've been working with the team over at Blue Ocean, making sure that we are being as helpful as possible in them scaling their infrastructure, helping them with testing and we are confident that they've a testing and scaling plan in place that will allow us to release this product safely and handle much larger load across all the symbols we offer. And I think that is planning to be instituted over -- in the next week or so. I should also mention, 24-hour market has been incredibly successful, and that's partly the cause of all this attention. We are nearing $30 billion in volumes since launch in the overnight hours, and we are really excited because this product is one of the reasons why we believe that customers would be advantaged on Robinhood and they would have access that they wouldn't have on other platforms. So we are going to continue to invest in it. As with any product on the bleeding edge of innovation, you should expect the reliability and the quality to improve consistently over time. And we're going to make sure we continue to work with our partners, including Blue Ocean so that we can deliver that for you all. Thanks Dan. Yes. And I would just add that, of course, clarity is good and we believe the US needs to be a leader in crypto, and we will get the clarity here in the domestic market. We haven't felt constrained by this with regard to our crypto business. We've been really happy at the speed of execution and innovation. Of course, we built a system that offers different products, Solana staking, more asset selection in the EU. In the US, there is plenty of work to do, and we believe we can be successful regardless of what administration ultimately ends up taking power in November or if it's the same one. We've done a lot of work to innovate on pricing. And you've seen year-over-year increases in market share and volumes of our crypto business as well. So there's plenty of work to do. And I just want to emphasize one other thing I mentioned earlier in the remarks which is that we haven't really taken the lid off of the new active trader products. Our active trader business is the most mature and investments that we make there have the most immediate impact on our business, relative to our investments growing wallet share and also internationally. And we've got an event for our active traders in October, where we are going to unveil some new products. And I think we are getting very, very excited about it. So those results that you are seeing, I mean there -- they're good results. We're proud of them, but I think we have plenty of room to run on the active trader side, and that includes margin, but it also includes new product innovations that we've been [baking] (ph) for the majority of the year. Yes. Well, what I'll tell you is that on the active trader front, we've talked a lot about futures. We've talked a lot about how we're great on mobile, but there's a lot of existing customers that need the more power of a web interface and a desktop interface. So they can take advantage of extra screen real estate and use better tools and charting. So those are gaps in a way, but also opportunities for us to really differentiate and innovate and jump ahead of what we've seen elsewhere. I think regarding more sort of like passive buy-and-hold assets like CDs and mutual funds, we are climbing the capability curve with our ACAT transfers product and we made a ton of progress just this year, making the process of moving assets into Robinhood as easy as possible. I think that's really led to some of the bottom-line results that you're seeing, including net positive account transfers from every major incumbent brokerage firm for several quarters running now. And the goal would be to actually accelerate that over time. We see plenty of opportunity we want to remove reasons that customers have for withdrawing, and we think we can systematically reduce reasons for withdrawals over the long run and also increased reasons for customers to deposit. And so this is one thing we're really focused on, and it's going to take some time to play out. But I think you should see that reflect over the long run and increased net deposit activity. We're going to go through and add all of the assets that are missing. We are going to add all the capabilities and then we're going to make sure the process of transferring is better at Robinhood than anywhere else. And then the incentives that we offer because of our economics are just kind of the cherry on top that I think will really accelerate asset growth into the platform. So I'm getting \u2013 there's so much to do here and we're just at the beginning. And we only started offering incoming ACATs in the past couple of years, and we've already made a ton of progress here. Yes. The only thing that I would add to that, which I think is interesting is I think we've talked a lot -- you hear a lot about AI and the impact on different sorts of companies. I think one area that we maybe haven't emphasized as much is how we've been making use of that operationally, including for engineering. And as we look at kind of the core engine of our business, we are creating software, we're rolling out products to companies and our business even though we're in financial services, is technology at its core. And we've seen a lot of impact in applying these AI tools on the engineering side, just making different parts of software development process easier and simpler. That's an area we're investing a lot in. And I think there is a lot of room to run. We've already seen significant productivity gains in the past year, and we think we're just -- we're closer to the beginning than to the maturation point of that cycle. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll field that. In a nutshell, we like the early signs that we are seeing. So far, account balances overseas are a little bit smaller than the US on average, but the trading characteristics are pretty similar. And what we really like is as we hear from customers, both in the UK for brokerage and in the EU for crypto, they want things that we offer in the U.S. So UK customers are requesting margin and options and EU customers are requesting the ability to trade stocks. So that I think, validates in part our strategy of expanding with one unified platform internationally. And having the same technology be available in as many markets worldwide as possible. So our focus really is rounding out the feature set in the UK and in the EU, making sure that all of the great products that we have available in the US can be made available there. And that involves working with the relevant regulators in these jurisdictions, taking them along and giving their customers access to all of these awesome products, we feel really, really good about that. And then simultaneously, we are looking into expanding to other jurisdictions. I think there's two interesting things about the Bitstamp acquisition that you should know. One of them is international. The second one is institutional the business is a global business. It operates in a lot of jurisdictions, and we could see that accelerating our international expansion on the crypto side, significantly. And also dovetailing quite nicely with the large retail business that we currently have at Robinhood and the great product innovation that we're driving there. The other thing we are excited about is institutional business, and they have great relationships with institutions. It is an area that we believe we are well positioned to tackle because we've built great technology for consumers and institutions also want low cost for market access to crypto. And so we are really excited about the acquisition and working really closely with the team and making our joint products better and better. And I wouldn't over-index on their fee structure at this point. I'd tell you, philosophically, we want to be the market share leader, and we want to offer really competitive rates to customers. And that's kind of the North Star that Robinhood operates under. We'd rather offer low fees and due to our investments in technology and infrastructure, operate at larger scale than our competitors. So you should see us continuing to be aggressive there. But we don't have any specific -- I think it's premature to talk about like the specific changes to the fee structure at this point. I'll feel that and then maybe Jason will have some thoughts. What are the reasons we deemphasized monthly active users besides as you mentioned, us investing in all these diversified products like Robinhood Gold, which is a yield-based product and retirement and us not directly monetizing monthly active users yet, like we don't have an advertising business, for instance, is that it's just volatile quarter-to-quarter. And a lot of the monthly active user variation is just driven by what's going on in the crypto market. So since we're so large in retail crypto that can cause meaningful swings in monthly active users quarter-over-quarter. And that's pretty much what you see going on. When the crypto markets are hot, there is a huge immediate spike in monthly active user engagement metrics. But then when crypto cools down, that tends to drop more acutely as well. And I think that's pretty similar to what you'd see across the entire crypto market. I think that's not an idiosyncratic Robinhood phenomenon. The only thing that I'd add, Ken, is there is a number of areas that we are focused on, and I outlined them in the call, one of them is being the leader in the active trader market. And I think when the goal there is when people think of Robinhood in the active trader space, they should associate us with being at the frontier of technology and innovation in trading. And I think products like 24-hour market reinforce that -- and we do have work to do, both on the product side and kind of in how we tell the story to move away from sort of this like thought that for novices. The reality is most of our customers are in their 30s, they're definitely adults and they're extremely sophisticated. And we are in a competitive market for serving this very real use case, and we're gaining market share, and it's a big part of the core business. But we also have customers that are coming to us for Robinhood Gold for our high-yield products for our awesome retirement products that has been growing assets very, very tremendously. And they're less interested in trading actively, and that's fine, too. We think that we can be a leader in wallet share, particularly for the millennial generation. And that's something that we're also focused on. There's going to be tens of trillions of assets going from baby boomers down to Gen X and Gen Y and beyond. And we are putting Robinhood in a position to be one of the, if not the primary beneficiary of that long-term shift in assets and that kind of how you're seeing the work we're doing in ACATs, diversifying the business and adding support for different assets. And so we're very excited about that, but we think we can be leaders in both. Yes. I mean, the thing I'd tell you and maybe Jason can jump into our options team has been doing a great job. We have one major advantage. I mean, several major advantages relative to what you see elsewhere in the options market. First of all, we don't charge options contract fees. So most of our competitors charge $0.65 a contract, which can add up if you're an active trader. And so purely economic perspective, you're kind of at a disadvantage if you trade options outside of Robinhood, particularly for active traders. The other area is the user experience. And we've built and announced some amazing tools in the past couple of quarters, including option simulated returns which gives people a pretty advanced analytic tool that they previously were downloading other products and paying subscription fees to get. Now that's built in with Robinhood. And we've done awesome improvements to the user experience to make it easier for customers to do the transactions that they want to do. And we've got a lot of remaining work to do. We know a lot of our customers like trading options on desktop where they get additional screen real estate and have the opportunity to do more research on platform. And so we're confident that we can keep growing that market share even further. Yes. The team has really been doing a great job."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. As we discussed last quarter, we are focused on driving another year of profitable growth and in Q2 we continue to make good progress. We drove new highs in revenues, adjusted EBITDA, net income, and GAAP EPS in Q2. Compared to a year ago, total net revenues grew 40% to $682 million. Adjusted EBITDA roughly doubled to $301 million. Incremental margins were 77%. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 13 points to 44%, as we make progress over time towards the 50% plus levels comparable to what we see from incumbent brokerage firms. And net income was $188 million, or $0.21 per share, up 7 times from a year ago. And taking a look at the past year, it's great to see how a number of strong quarters came together. For the last 12 months, revenues were over $2.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA was over $800 million, both new highs. We're pleased with these results as we aim to continue delivering profitable growth in 2024. Now let's move to Q2 business results. Assets under custody finished Q2 at a record $140 billion, up 57% year-over-year. A key driver of that asset growth was record Q2 net deposits of over $13 billion, which translates to a 41% annualized growth rate. It's also great to see how assets continue to diversify. Retirement AUC was nearly $9 billion in Q2, more than doubling from last quarter. And cash sweep balances were a record $21 billion in Q2, up 76% year-over-year. We're also driving growth in Robinhood Gold, which continues to deliver value to both our customers and our shareholders. As a reminder, gold subscribers on average are 7 times larger than our customers overall, have been growing net deposits twice as fast, and adopt products at higher rates, leading to gold ARPU that is over 7 times our customer average. In Q2, we grew gold subscribers to 2 million, up over 60% year-over-year. This represents an adoption rate of 8.2% of customers, up from 5.3% a year ago. We are excited to see continued momentum in our gold program, which now includes annualized recurring subscription revenue of over $100 million. Now let's turn to our financial results, starting with Q2 revenues compared to last quarter. Transaction-based revenues were roughly flat as equities and options increased while crypto revenues declined with industry volumes. Net interest revenues grew due to higher securities lending activity and higher interest earning asset balances and other revenues increased driven by proxy seasonality and continued growth in Robinhood gold. Turning the second quarter expenses, combined adjusted OpEx and SBC was $493 million in Q2, this includes increased employee bonus accruals given the strong start we've had to the year, as well as some costs related to our two recently announced acquisitions, Bitstamp and Pluto. All in, through the first half of the year, our expenses are on track with the middle of our full year outlook range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. So we're keeping our outlook unchanged and we'll continue actively managing our expenses based on the returns we see on our growth investments, as well as the macro environment. Before I pass the call back to Vlad, I want to share some perspectives about how we are thinking about capital deployment. When we think about capital allocation, our primary objective is to maximize earnings and free cash flow per share over time. We do this by allocating capital to organic growth and M&A to drive earnings and free cash flow higher. And we complement that with share repurchases that can increase the value per share. And in Q2, we made good progress. First, we continued to invest in organic growth in areas like product development, marketing, and customer matches. We have a lot of momentum and I like the economics we're driving. Second, we announced two acquisitions. In June, we signed an agreement to acquire Bitstamp, a global crypto exchange. We believe it will accelerate our crypto roadmap, enabling us to serve a broader user base, enhance our capabilities, and provide additional liquidity for crypto trading. Additionally, we acquired Pluto to help us move even faster in AI and advisory. We're excited to share more as we make progress here. And finally, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which we started executing in July and currently expect to execute over a two year to three year period. This timeline could vary depending on market conditions and other capital allocation opportunities. Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to drive higher earnings and free cash flow per share over time, driven by our 20% plus [net deposit] (ph) growth, naturally hedged business model, and 90% fixed cost base. And we have a lot of momentum entering the second half of the year, as our business is having a great start to Q3. As context, June was a strong month with nearly record options volume, close to a 24-month high for equities volume, and over $4 billion of net deposits. And in July, trading volumes were more than 20% higher than June across equities, options, and crypto. And net deposits were again over $4 billion. While August is just getting started, so far it looks a lot like July, including over $1 billion of net deposits in the first week of August. With that, I'll turn the call back to Vlad. I'll go ahead and start. It is Jason here, and Vlad can contribute with his thoughts as well. So in terms of what the implications would be of improved regulatory environment for crypto, I think what that would do is really allow us to innovate more rapidly and bring more to market what customers would like to see in crypto. And in the current situation, we are able to do that more in the EU than we are in the US. And I know that can be frustrating for our customers. And so I think you hit on some of the top things. We'd be able to offer more coins. And certainly, there's a wide selection of coins that because of the regulatory environment, we're not comfortable listing today. We'd also be able to innovate in new products and services, things like lending and taking and bring that to market. So in terms of the revenue opportunity, I mean I think for tokens, you could just estimate looking at share of market and overall industry volumes as they are traded in other platforms here in the US and abroad, as well as the other services that we don't yet offer. So I think it could be meaningful, and we are continuing to work with our regulators to gain that clarity. The second part of your question, Steven was around take rates. And so in the quarter, the crypto take rate was 38 bps. That's up 3 bps quarter-over-quarter. That's really due to pricing experiments. Looking at Q3 and July, the crypto take rates were in the low $0.40 range. And we'll see how we go from there. But we continue to offer great pricing to customers and are excited to see how the quarter plays out. Sure. I'll take that one. So first of all, we've got a lot of experience operating in different rate environments, high rate environments, low rate environments. One thing that we really like about our business is the natural offset between rates and trading. So as rates fall, asset values and trading tend to increase. And overall, lower rates tend to be a tailwind for growth for our business. I think there is a couple of important things to call out. First, we've been growing our interest-earning assets at a really nice pace. But not all of our interest earning assets are sensitive to rate changes. So actually, over half of the balance of interest earning assets relates to our cash sweep and the spread we earn there is relatively fixed, which minimizes the impact of changes in rates. Second, we are broadening the way that we serve our customers. And that's leading to a much more diversified business for us. Specific to the question you asked about what the rate impact is, so assuming a 25 basis point change or decline that would affect NIM by $40 million. And hard to predict the exact timing, but we feel good about the natural hedge. We have $1 billion of transaction-based revenue, and it takes a relatively small uptick in trading activity to offset that decline in interest. You bet. So we have a long track record of 20% plus organic growth rate, and we have a really strong first half of the year, as you pointed out. I think what I can say that would be helpful here is that that's continuing so far into Q3. We are seeing an incredibly strong July with activity across the three trading categories up 20% over the June levels, and we are seeing that continue in August. So over $4 billion of net deposits in July and over $1 billion in the first week of August. So all signs at this point in the quarter are showing that our customers continue to engage with us, continue to deposit their money with us. And I think as Vlad mentioned, we now have eight businesses where the annualized revenue run rate is over $100 million. And so we are much more diversified today than we were even just a couple of years ago, and I think very well positioned, especially as we continue innovating for customers and rolling out new products. to continue driving outsized organic growth. Yes. I view kind of the 50%, Devin, is more of a way station on our path to the longer-term margins. You've seen us drive substantial incremental margins over the last few years. This quarter it was 77%. And it's really a reflection of us driving up revenue and managing our costs closely. I think a good analogy to how we're thinking about cost long term is looking at what we did in 2024. We looked at our existing businesses and held those businesses to a low single digit and in some cases, negative OpEx growth rate. And we use those savings to help fund specific growth investments for the business. And there are many that we've been talking about and alluding to on this call, and we set aside an extra $100 million in marketing budget. And all of that translated to operating expense guidance that was up 5% at the midpoint, which we continue to reiterate. And so I think we have a lot of opportunity to see continuing leverage in our existing business. And then you are going to see us on top of that, continue to make very targeted high expected ROI investments for growth. In terms of things that are out there on the road map, it's too early to give specific guidance. The one thing I'd point to is we are rolling out a credit card. And as Vlad talked about, we are being very patient in the short term in the way that we approach that, but that will certainly be some incremental investments next year. But well, stay tuned for a specific guidance on next year. Yes, I'll go ahead and take this one. What I'd say is our focus right now is increasing the adoption rate of our customers in gold, and we are doing that by just continuing to invest in the Gold program and we love the economics. I mean it is great that we have the subscription revenue that's north of $100 million annually, but it leads to downstream effects, higher adoption faster net deposits and 7 times the ARPU. And so we are not feeling pressured in the short term to raise the price. It is something that we will continue to look at. And we don't have religion that we wouldn't touch the price over time. But right now, it's not the top priority. Yes. I'll go ahead and take this. So it's mostly from existing customers, but we are seeing both existing as well as new customers take advantage of the lower margin rates. And we continue to see this grow in July. We talk about one of our top three strategic pillars is to be Number #1 in active trading. And as Vlad mentioned, we've made a lot of progress on market share for both equities and options and overall or number two, in active trading for those categories for trading, but we are a distant fifth in market share in margins. So it's a huge opportunity for us. We just lowered the rates in May, and we saw the 20% move to the end of the quarter, that's continuing in July. And we think that this is a really big opportunity, and we're definitely starting to take share there. We grew much faster than our peers in the second quarter, even with the May change in the rates. Sure. I'll go ahead and take that. I mean the primary inputs to the business are signing up more customers, and we saw a really nice pickup there, about 400,000 customers joined the program. In the quarter and the assets that are enrolled, and that increased by a little over $6 billion. So really strong inputs into the business. I thought the trading desk did a really nice job. The other input is just the rates that are available and the specific names that we call specials, where there's a higher rebate that we'll earn on lending activity. And we saw some nice attractive returns in the quarter. So I'd say, the inputs and the momentum of growing that program is really strong. Trading desk is just doing a great job, and we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out. Yes, I'll go ahead and take this and Vlad you can add some context. So first of all, customers who are trading options and those that are using leverage tend to be are more advanced customers, and they're using a variety of trading strategies to create returns. The thing that I would point to is that we feel great about offering low price and attractive rates. And the rates that we offer on the margin book as an example, are on average, leading across the industry. And so we feel really good about that. I don't think we've shared any specifics on specific returns that individual customers are having or groups of customers. What I'll tell you is almost every time I look at the daily summary reports, when there is a sell-off our customers are buying or when prices are up, our customers are selling. And that contributes to kind of a pretty attractive return capability for customers. Yes. I would just say that the number of customers trading options are up about 25% year-over-year."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Chris Koegel, VP of Corporate FP&A and Investor Relations. You may begin.\nChris Koegel: Thank you, Joanna, and thank you to everyone for joining Robinhood's Q1 earnings call. With us today are our CEO, and Co-Founder, Vlad Tenev; and CFO, Jason Warnick. Before getting started, I want to remind you that today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from our expectations, and we have no duty to provide updates unless legally required. Potential risk factors that could cause differences, including regulatory developments that we continue to monitor, are described in the press release we issued today, the earnings presentation, and our SEC filings, all of which can be found at investors.robinhood.com. Today's discussion will also include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the GAAP results we consider most comparable can be found in the earnings presentation. With that, let me turn it over to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. I again will keep my remarks short so that we can have plenty of time for questions. So, just to remind everyone, Robinhood is focused on three things: number one, winning the active trader market; number two, increasing wallet share with our customers; and number three, expanding internationally. We believe the strategy is working and it led to strong business outcomes in Q1. First, retail market -- retail trading market share. It can continue to increase in Q1 and it was really bolstered by our product innovation. As a result, year-over-year notional trading volumes were up significantly across equities, options and crypto. Net deposits, they were a record $11.2 billion with strong diversity across brokerage, cash sweep, and retirement. This translates to a 44% annualized organic growth rate and continues our multi-year track record of delivering 20%-plus net deposit growth. And customers are also moving their assets to Robinhood in record numbers. Q1 was the second quarter in a row we had net asset inflows from every other major brokerage, totaling nearly $3 billion, more than twice our Q4 level. I also wanted to highlight Gold subscribers. Customers are finding our Gold offerings compelling across high-yield cash, retirement, margin rates, and now our Gold credit card. This led Gold subscribers to reach 1.7 million in Q1, higher than at any other point in our history. The 260,000 Gold subscribers we added in Q1 was the fastest in the past three years. It's also exciting to see that nearly 20% of new funded customers in Q1 subscribed to Gold, and that's more than double a year ago. Putting this all together with continued expense discipline led to record revenues of 40% year-over-year, and record GAAP EPS of positive $0.18. Now what's even more exciting is that we continue to deliver amazing value to customers. And before I share more about what we're doing for our Gold customers, let's have Jason review our financial results.\nJason Warnick: Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. As a reminder, last year we drove significant profitable growth, with revenue up 37% and adjusted EBITDA margins expanding by 36 points. In 2024, we are focused on driving another year of profitable growth and we had a strong Q1, with 40% year-over-year revenue growth and 14 points of margin expansion from a year ago. We also set records in Q1 for quarterly revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net income, and GAAP EPS. Looking more closely at our Q1 results compared to a year ago, total net revenues grew 40% to $618 million; adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $247 million; incremental margins were 75%, demonstrating the scalability of our cost structure even while we increased marketing and growth investments; and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 14 points to 40% as we make progress over time towards the 50%-plus levels we see from incumbents. All of this led to net income of $157 million, or $0.18 of EPS. We're pleased with our results in Q1 and we aim to continue delivering profitable growth in 2024. Now, let's move to our first quarter business results. Assets under custody finished Q1 at around -- at a record $130 billion, up 65% year-over-year. A key driver of that asset growth was strong Q1 net deposits of over $11 billion, which is more than double last year's quarterly average, and translates to a 44% annualized growth rate. We are encouraged by the breadth and durability of Q1 net deposits. So, let me share a little more color. First, we saw strong participation from both existing and new customers, with about 75% of net deposits coming from customers who've been at Robinhood for over a year. Second, we saw a nice mix of continued strong contributions from customers and wins versus brokerage incumbents. The mix was about 75% contributions from customers and 25% net wins from incumbents. And third, deposits into our platform were balanced across product categories, a little more than half of Q1 net deposits went to brokerage, another quarter went to cash sweep, and the last 20% to retirement. So overall, we are really pleased with the diversity of net deposits as customers engage with us across our platform. Looking at Q2, so far it's off to a good start as well, as April was our highest month of the year for net deposits with nearly $5 billion. And with our continued progress in early May, we've already brought in more net deposits year-to-date than the $17 billion we did in all of 2023, with most of the year still in front of us. We're also delivering growth in Robinhood Gold. As a reminder of how Gold subscribers on average compare to our customers overall, in Q1, Gold subscribers had 8 times the [assets] (ph) with an average of over $40,000, grew net deposits roughly twice as fast, and had 5 times the retirement account adoption. Gold ARPU is also multiples of our average customer, which includes annualized recurring subscription revenue approaching $100 million. And in Q1, we grew Gold subscribers to 1.7 million, up 42%, or 500,000 from last year. This momentum has continued into Q2 as we added another 140,000 Gold subscribers in April, more than half of our Q1 growth. Let's now turn to our financial results. In the first quarter, we generated net income of $157 million, up 5x sequentially as we grew revenues and stayed disciplined on expenses. Looking at Q1 revenues, transaction-based revenues increased sequentially across equities, options, and crypto, and net interest revenues grew as a result of higher balances and securities lending activity. So far in Q2, we've continued to see robust trading. In April, equity notional volumes were about $70 billion; options contracts were a monthly record of roughly $125 million; and crypto notional volumes were around $10 billion. Now let's turn to first quarter expenses. Combined adjusted OpEx and SBC was $460 million in Q1, as we stayed disciplined on expenses even as we increased investments in marketing and growth. Looking ahead, while the year is off to a strong start, we know it's important to stay disciplined on expenses. So, our full year adjusted OpEx and SBC outlook is unchanged in the range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. Before I pass the call back to Vlad, I want to share some perspectives about our opportunity to drive profitable growth in 2024 and the years to come by growing revenues and expanding margins. First, we believe we can continue our multi-year track record of delivering 20%-plus net deposit growth rates, supported by a young customer base gaining share of global wealth, share gains in existing markets, and expansion into new markets and product categories that give us more opportunity for growth. Second, as customer assets grow over time, we believe this will drive strong revenue growth as well. We are naturally hedged between interest rates and trading, and we continue to diversify our business as we introduce new products and enter new markets. And third, we're a technology company and a highly scalable platform with about 90% fixed costs. So, as our revenues increase, we believe we can drive significant margin expansion and free cash flow. In closing, we had a strong Q1, and we have a lot of momentum to start the second quarter. We remain focused on driving profitable growth for shareholders as we work to maximize EPS and free cash flow per share in 2024 and the years to come. Now, I'll turn the call back to Vlad.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Jason. As I said earlier, the second part of our strategy is increasing wallet share with customers, including growing Robinhood Gold subscriptions, which hit an all-time high of 1.7 million in Q1. In March, we held Robinhood's first-ever keynote event to introduce even more value that we are providing Gold customers, including an all-new customizable app experience, a 1% unlimited deposit boost for Gold customers that's launching soon, and a brand new Robinhood Gold credit card with 3% back on all purchases. We're seeing lots of commentary about how amazing of a deal Gold is, and we're happy customers are recognizing that and starting to spread the word. Over 1 million people have signed up for the Gold card waitlist, only half of which are Gold subscribers today. So, we believe we can substantially grow Gold adoption as we roll out the card. We love seeing the progress we're making, attracting, retaining, and expanding Gold customer relationships on the journey to be the most trusted, lowest-cost, and most culturally-relevant money app worldwide. I want to thank our customers for continuing to trust and advocate for the platform as we make progress on our mission to democratize finance for all. The business is in a great position because of you and we're just getting started. And you should know our team has been working incredibly hard to deliver even more value to you. The roadmap is full. There's so much to do. And now, let's move on to questions.\nA - Chris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. For the Q&A session, we'll start by answering the top few shareholder questions from Say Technologies ranked by a number of votes. We passed over questions that we had already addressed on this call or in prior quarters and grouped together questions that shared a common theme. After the Say questions, we'll turn to live questions from our analysts. So, we'll kick it off with our first question from Say. Alexander M. asks, what impact will the SEC Wells notice have on the business? Jason, do you want to start on that one?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, I'll maybe start and then Vlad can add some thoughts. First, for our customers, your accounts are not affected by this. It's business as usual for Robinhood Crypto. We're, of course, disappointed to have received the notice. As you know, we've operated our crypto business in good faith. We've been very conservative in our approach in terms of coins listed and services offered. And we're a highly regulated company and have applied the same legal and compliance standards we use for our brokerage to the way we run our crypto business. So, it's disappointing to see more regulation by enforcement here. Vlad?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I mean, echoing Jason, this is a disappointing development. We firmly believe U.S. consumers should have access to this asset class. They deserve to be on equal footing with people all over the world. And at the end of the day, we're going to defend the firm and continue to advocate for our customers.\nChris Koegel: Great. Thank you. The next question is from Joseph C., who asks, when are the new credit cards getting fully released? It seems that many are still on the waiting list. Vlad, do you want to start that one?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. First of all, we are really excited about the Gold card and the value that we're going to be providing to customers. We've seen a ton of demand. I mentioned earlier, over 1 million customers have signed up for the waitlist so far. And the product is looking great. You might have noticed we've dropped the credit card app on the app store and we've rolled it out to the first customers outside of the company. As we think about this roll out, we really want to balance the desire to get the card to customers as quickly as we can with making sure that we are managing risk to the capital well as we enter a new market for us. So, we are starting with an initial group in the tens of thousands of customers over the next few weeks. And then, we're going to observe them carefully, look at the data, watch the spending activity and the borrowing activity, and we're going to use that information to inform the broader roll out of the card. We really want to make sure that we're being very, very prudent as we do this roll out since this is a new business line for the company.\nChris Koegel: Great. Thank you, Vlad. And then, the third question from Say is from Daniel R., who asks, 24 Hour Market was halted. How can we trust that the platform when markets become volatile, what steps are being implemented to handle future volatility?\nVlad Tenev: Well, first, it's really been awesome to see how much interest there is in our 24 Hour Market offering. Over 10 billion in volumes have transacted in the overnight section since it launched a year ago. And we now offer overnight trading in over 900 names. And really, this is one of the core differentiators of Robinhood. You don't find this type of offering elsewhere easily. As for why trading was affected? So, in order to facilitate these trades, we route to a third-party ATS. The ATS we use went down for the evening. This affected us, but also other firms that route to it. But the ATS was able to support trading again in a handful of hours. Looking ahead, we're really on the frontier with this offering, but as we continue to invest in it, the offering will improve over time and it will get more resilient. So, believe us when we say that we're committed to making sure this offering is reliable and more feature-rich going forward.\nChris Koegel: All right. Thank you, Vlad. That concludes our shareholder questions from Say Technologies. We appreciate our shareholders taking the time to ask these questions to Vlad and Jason and look forward to more next quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Joanna to lead Q&A from analysts.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.\nDevin Ryan: Hey, thanks so much. Hi, Vlad. Hi, Jason. How are you?\nVlad Tenev: Hey, Devin.\nDevin Ryan: I want to ask a question on the growth in new deposits. I mean, just really impressive momentum there and good to hear the second quarter is accelerating further. And it feels like you're just scratching the surface on Gold adoption, I think Vlad as you talked about. And I also think that the offering really stands out in the market. So, with that said, I heard Jason's comments on better ARPU for Gold customers, but is it possible to kind of simplistically unpack the economics you're expecting on new deposits coming into a Gold-connected account under these new promotions relative to deposits that aren't or even kind of like revenue per asset under kind of the model prior to these promotions? I'm just trying to think about the economics kind of [indiscernible] dollars coming in because it seems like you're seeing a really nice acceleration there. Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Yeah. Thanks, Devin. It's Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. So in short, we love the economics of the match promotions that we've been running. I think I said last quarter that the payback on the 1% match is a little under a year, and on the 3% match, it's between two and three years. And we're watching that closely kind of on a monthly cohort basis with our customers. We're seeing the 2023 cohorts already paying off and 2024 is off to a great start. We mentioned on our prepared remarks too that the strength of net deposits, 44% annualized growth rate is really well-diversified between customers that have been at the company for -- have been at Robinhood for over a year, representing 75% of those net deposits. And we are also seeing that 75% cut a different way are unrelated to the promotion. So, really strong promotion response, but it's only a small part of the strength of the overall deposits for the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. Great results out there. Really, really nice.\nVlad Tenev: Thanks, Dan.\nDan Dolev: Of course. Yes, so you mentioned some really strong numbers in April, really strong momentum. Can you maybe elaborate a little more regarding the momentum that you're seeing heading into the second quarter? Any color and additional views on the momentum would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, absolutely, Dan. I mean -- so we're seeing strong trading across equities, options, and crypto continuing into the next quarter. We're seeing strength kind of across the business as well in terms of new Gold subscribers. We mentioned and you mentioned the strength in net deposits, nearly $5 billion. So, we're really seeing great diversity of the strength. Retirement assets are now crossing over $7 billion, which is just remarkable growth and we love to see our customers saving for the long-term with us. We're going to share our metrics, I think next week on the month of April and so you'll get a fuller picture there. But it's really across the board, whether it's sec lending or trading or net deposits.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. And I would just add, we are, of course, excited about the Q1 performance and the start to Q2. Well, I think we have some medium and longer-term tailwinds to the business. The Gold benefits that we announced in March, including the 1% deposit match, which really has resonated quite strongly with customers based on early feedback, has yet to launch. We're entering a new product category with the credit card. And we've also been working on our futures and web Pro product for active traders. And we here get an early look at the products that we're building and the teams have been working incredibly hard to make what we believe are incredibly polished products that we're very excited about. So, I think we tend to get excited about things on a quarterly basis, but we're running this business for the long-term and I think that you'll see a lot more from us.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak: Hi. Good afternoon, Vlad. Good afternoon, Jason.\nJason Warnick: Hello?\nVlad Tenev: Hey, Steven.\nSteven Chubak: Yeah. So, I wanted to start off with a question just on the incremental margin ex-SBC coming in at 75%, certainly a good outcome. As we think about the incremental profitability as the business scales, is that 75% bogey a reasonable expectation for investors to underwrite? And just trying to gauge whether there's room for even further operating leverage, or upside given the marketing spend was actually relatively elevated in the quarter as well?\nJason Warnick: Yeah, thanks for the question. So, we are not providing guidance necessarily on incremental margins. What I'd tell you is, as I've said in previous sessions, that about 90% of our cost structure is fixed, meaning that 10% of our costs kind of are variable relative to the activity of our platform. So that gives us a lot of opportunity to drop incremental revenue to the bottom-line. You're seeing us this year make a really big step up in marketing, about $100 million year-over-year is our plan to spend in marketing versus last year. And as Vlad was touching on in the last question, we are making a lot of investments and not sitting still. And even with all this step up in marketing and investments for growth, we're delivering incremental margins at 75%. So, we feel really good about that. We're going to continue to watch our costs. Excited to see revenue per employee cross over $1 million. I think that there's a lot of opportunity to expand margins going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a question on the Gold card. Obviously, the offering is very compelling, and great to see the demand with the waitlist at over 1 million users already. But just wondering if you could expand upon the expected economics a bit. You've noted the $300 ARPU previously, but that was for X1 with a relatively small subset of users that you ultimately ramp to with this offering. And just given how attractive the card might be for some more transactor types and those don't carry a balance, are you still confident in your ability to profitably monetize a broad range of potential new clients? And then, if I just add a second part of that question. Can you give us any flavor on what you might expect on the transaction revenue side for the offering specifically? I'm assuming maybe some level of headwind after netting out interchange in rewards, but wondering if you can kind of frame that. Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, you bet. Thanks, Kyle, for the question. It's Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. The first point I'd make on the credit card is that we think it's really strategically aligned with our vision that we want to serve all of our customers' assets and process all of their financial transactions and having a great value credit card, I think is really fundamental to that vision. That said, we need to do this in a prudent way and in a way that makes sense economically for the company. And on that point, I think that we've got a few things that are going to benefit us. First of all, we're going to be able to leverage our scale. We're seeing that already play out with a low CAC. We have over 1 million customers on the waitlist with essentially no marketing dollars against that. And when you look at competitors, they're spending several hundred dollars, perhaps $500 per customer to acquire a customer. And so, we really love the low CAC opportunity to -- that leverages our platform. We're also able versus X1 to get even better economics. And for example, cost of funds, we've already been able to improve by over 300 basis points because of our strong balance sheet and because of our strength in the financial results. And so, those are a couple of areas that I'd point out. And then thirdly, I'd say that we have an opportunity to benefit because of our deeper relationship with customers. It's going to help us understand better the customers that we are underwriting and make better decisions, and over time, have an opportunity to offer collateralized cards, which would also help with our economics. As Vlad -- I'd just finished with, as Vlad pointed out, we're going to be really careful and prudent here. We're rolling it out to tens of thousands of customers and we're going to take months to look at how our customers are responding, how they're using the card, their borrowing and repayment activity, and we are going to use that to inform our broader roll out. And the last point, I would make is two-thirds of our customers are prime or higher in terms of credit rating. And so, we do have a high-quality customer base. And so together with the prudent roll out and the high-quality customers and benefiting from our scale and our deeper relationships with customers, we think we can land a good economic outcome for Robinhood.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMike Cyprys: Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about capital allocation. Hoping you could update us just around your latest thoughts there with $5 billion of balance sheet cash and investments. Just curious how you're thinking about the appetite for dividends, buybacks, M&A, where M&A can be most additive at this point, given you just added on the card platform side? And then just on a minute, maybe just remind us of your hurdle rates and criteria there? Thank you.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, thanks, Mike. We love the strong balance sheet, over $5 billion of corporate cash. Three ways to use the capital to the benefit of shareholders. One is just investing in our business for organic growth and you're seeing us do that with their incremental investments for growth, including the $100 million step-up in marketing this year. The second is M&A. You've seen us recently acquire X1. We have a very active Corp Dev team and we're looking at several opportunities there that can either augment our team, the talent of our team, or accelerate our product roadmap. And nothing to announce, but the team is certainly active. And then the last category is returning capital to shareholders. You saw us do that last year in the third quarter, about $600 million to purchase 5% of our outstanding shares. And so, we are deploying capital kind of across all three. In terms of hurdle rates, you'd expect us to use our cost-of-capital at least, and we are mindful of that. And nothing further to update you now on capital allocation. It was something that we're kind of constantly looking at.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Todaro with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nJohn Todaro: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. And yeah, great results here. I guess just trying to understand...\nJason Warnick: Hey, John.\nJohn Todaro: ...yeah, of course, the crypto side of the business post the Wells notice and just kind of get a little bit more color on where you're thinking at. And I guess in particular, if you look at it and you go, \"Hey, we're kind of almost being treated the same way as Coinbase,\" does it start to make sense where you look at more broader listings because you guys have been fairly conservative on that front? Or is that not really a fair way to think about it?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I think you're right in that. We've been extremely selective about the assets that we offer on the platform. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have seen increases in volumes and in market share on the crypto side. I think for a long time, we were offering customers great pricing on purchasing crypto assets, but we weren't doing a great job of communicating it. And now we are communicating it through the user interface and through all sorts of marketing surfaces. And I think customers are starting to pick up on that fact. You're seeing it talked about more in social media, just how great of a deal they're getting on crypto transactions. And we're expanding in the EU where we again believe that we can provide great service and great offerings to customers. So, the crypto team has been working tremendously hard. The roadmap there is quite full. There's a lot to do to make the products experience better for customers.\nJason Warnick: And I would just add that we've been incredibly selective in the coins that we've listed and are confident that the coin selection does not include any better securities and we continue to apply that high standard on anything that we would list on our platform.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: All right. Great. Thanks. Good evening. Maybe just staying on the crypto theme, maybe Vlad and Jason, if you can talk about just the nature of the surge in crypto volumes in March? And I think you said April was at $10 billion. I appreciate, of course, this is very volatile class, but maybe if you can just talk about what you're seeing that drove that heavy activity in March, and whether you think we could see spikes like that again? And then just the mix of crypto volumes between the EU and U.S. is -- maybe the EU is still very small, but just trying to get a sense of that.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I mean in terms of what drives crypto volumes, I think modulo our market share gains, our crypto activity does track the broader market. And I don't really want to get into prognosticating what the crypto market is going to do. That's obviously a difficult thing for anyone to do. It's a global market. There have been ETFs approved, as you all know. And that's why we look at market share and how we're doing relative to peers, because markets go up and down, but if our market share is growing throughout all conditions, then over the long run, we'll do very, very well on that side of the business. And that's kind of our approach across all of the asset classes for the active trader business. But the goal is also to diversify the business so that we're sort of like less reliant on volumes anywhere, in any one category to drive business results. I think that's kind of what you're starting to see in this quarter's results is really the performance of the company across all asset classes and even across wallet share with the net deposit growth numbers.\nJason Warnick: In terms of the mix element of your question on Europe, you're right, it's still a relatively modest contribution, the lion's share came from our U.S. crypto business, but we like what we're seeing, and tens of thousands of customers there. So, we'll continue investing there.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPatrick Moley: Yes, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. So I just had one on index options. I see it's referenced in the deck, but I didn't hear mentioned in the prepared remarks. So, are you still planning to roll out index options later this year? And then just on the economics, it's my understanding that index options are much less profitable for the brokers than multi-listed options are. So just curious if -- what your expectations are around how much of your current options trading could be cannibalized by index options? And if you do, or when you do roll it out, have you given any thought to potentially charging a commission on index options? Thanks.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. So, we have announced that we are going to be launching index options. This is part of the overall goal of giving our active traders access to the best tools and the best value for their services. So, index options are coming in Q4. We'll also be launching Futures as we've mentioned in the past. And as with any new Robinhood product, there's two areas where we'd like to stand out in the broader marketplace. One is the user experience. We want to make sure that our tools are easy for active traders to use, particularly on mobile, but also on web with the new offering that's coming there. And then economics. So, yeah, the economics, we intend to make very, very competitive, but also profitable for the company on a segment basis. So, Jason, I don't know if you want to add anything more specific there.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, we're still working with the team on the pricing structure for index options. So, we'll have to stay tuned there. But agree with Vlad that we want it to be a great value for customers and also make a lot of sense for us economically.\nVlad Tenev: And we should note index options trade round the clock, which is one of the reasons why they become so popular. So, we don't anticipate seeing a ton of cannibalization there.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Neill with FT Partners. Your line is open.\nMatthew O'Neill: Yes. Hi guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. A lot of good ones asked and answered already. I was wondering though since you are seeing such a clear inflection point in the MAUs and you gave some incremental details around the growth there from card, both Gold and non-Gold sounds like 0.5 million each, could you help parse maybe the rest of the monthly active user growth even just anecdotally like more crypto-focused or more options and equity-focused? Thanks.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, absolutely. There is an impact to MAUs when crypto interest surges and we saw that in the quarter. And so that's certainly a part of it. But when I look at the activity across the quarter, it was very broad-based; equities up, options activity up, certainly crypto retirement, Gold members, net deposits. And so, we really saw an overall lift that was reflected in the engagement numbers that you're seeing.\nMatthew O'Neill: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. When we look at your promotions...\nVlad Tenev: Hi, Ken.\nKen Worthington: Hi. When we look at your promotions, they seem focused on gathering additional customer assets. Do you think such asset-focused promotions could endure over the intermediate term or even longer term as a business strategy? Any reasons why the competition might not either be able to or just might not follow you with promotions of their own? And as we think about other behaviors you want to target, are there others that promotions might make sense for you to target at some point in the future?\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. I can start with that. I think the first thing I should note is we've invested in building a strong data science and product analytics capability from inception in the company. And I think that's starting to become a key differentiator now that AI is becoming more and more important, and now that we've started running these promotions, we look at it very closely. We can track them all sorts of ways across cohorts and different types of customer behavior. And we like what we're seeing. I think Jason mentioned earlier in the call that for the 1% matches, we've been targeting a sub-one-year payback and that's between two and three years for the 3% promotions, and the cohorts from 2023 have already paid back with 2024 looking good as well. So, we feel really good about the offering and you should see more creativity from the team going forward. I don't think that we've fully excavated what we can do with this capability that we've built.\nJason Warnick: Yeah, Ken, we love that we're taking share. We love that we're winning assets against the incumbents. And in terms of your question about how durable it is in the medium to longer term, I don't see any reason with our highly scalable platform that we can't continue to offer promotions like that, especially with the attractive paybacks that we're realizing. On your question about whether it's something that could be copied by competitors, I think we could all come up with a handful of reasons why it would be challenging for them, whether it's their cost structure or just their installed base, and defending that through a promotion like that. But we love the promotions here at Robinhood. And again, we like that we are taking share.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi, good evening, and thanks for taking the question. Just on the topic of competition, you highlighted that 25% of net transfers came from other brokerages. Can you just talk about like this customer cohort, how do they compare to your pre-existing customer base? Are they coming -- are you seeing any behaviors? Are they coming for the high savings rate? Are they coming for the deposit bonus? Are they active traders? Are they engaging in crypto? Like any kind of characteristics of this cohort, are they similar or different from sort of like the existing customer base? Thank you.\nVlad Tenev: Yeah. They're probably more similar than different. One of the things that I'd highlight is they're coming in with average balances that are much higher than our typical historical customers. So, loving the quality of the assets being brought and the activity of the customers. And it's really reflected too in the comments that we are making about payback periods on these promotions that we are seeing customers engage with our products in a way that generates revenue for us.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Vlad for closing remarks.\nVlad Tenev: All right. Thank you guys for all the questions. And look, we love the quarter. We love where the business is heading. I think that long-term, we are really positioning Robinhood to be a generational company that will benefit from a generational wealth transfer that is only starting now from older generations to Gen X and Millennials. And the goal over the long run is for all of our customers, all of their assets should be custodied at Robinhood and all of their financial transactions should go through Robinhood. And I think you're starting to see us make significant progress towards that. So, thank you for being with us on the call and on the journey.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Vlad Tenev",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Hi, everyone. I again will keep my remarks short so that we can have plenty of time for questions. So, just to remind everyone, Robinhood is focused on three things: number one, winning the active trader market; number two, increasing wallet share with our customers; and number three, expanding internationally. We believe the strategy is working and it led to strong business outcomes in Q1. First, retail market -- retail trading market share. It can continue to increase in Q1 and it was really bolstered by our product innovation. As a result, year-over-year notional trading volumes were up significantly across equities, options and crypto. Net deposits, they were a record $11.2 billion with strong diversity across brokerage, cash sweep, and retirement. This translates to a 44% annualized organic growth rate and continues our multi-year track record of delivering 20%-plus net deposit growth. And customers are also moving their assets to Robinhood in record numbers. Q1 was the second quarter in a row we had net asset inflows from every other major brokerage, totaling nearly $3 billion, more than twice our Q4 level. I also wanted to highlight Gold subscribers. Customers are finding our Gold offerings compelling across high-yield cash, retirement, margin rates, and now our Gold credit card. This led Gold subscribers to reach 1.7 million in Q1, higher than at any other point in our history. The 260,000 Gold subscribers we added in Q1 was the fastest in the past three years. It's also exciting to see that nearly 20% of new funded customers in Q1 subscribed to Gold, and that's more than double a year ago. Putting this all together with continued expense discipline led to record revenues of 40% year-over-year, and record GAAP EPS of positive $0.18. Now what's even more exciting is that we continue to deliver amazing value to customers. And before I share more about what we're doing for our Gold customers, let's have Jason review our financial results. Thanks, Jason. As I said earlier, the second part of our strategy is increasing wallet share with customers, including growing Robinhood Gold subscriptions, which hit an all-time high of 1.7 million in Q1. In March, we held Robinhood's first-ever keynote event to introduce even more value that we are providing Gold customers, including an all-new customizable app experience, a 1% unlimited deposit boost for Gold customers that's launching soon, and a brand new Robinhood Gold credit card with 3% back on all purchases. We're seeing lots of commentary about how amazing of a deal Gold is, and we're happy customers are recognizing that and starting to spread the word. Over 1 million people have signed up for the Gold card waitlist, only half of which are Gold subscribers today. So, we believe we can substantially grow Gold adoption as we roll out the card. We love seeing the progress we're making, attracting, retaining, and expanding Gold customer relationships on the journey to be the most trusted, lowest-cost, and most culturally-relevant money app worldwide. I want to thank our customers for continuing to trust and advocate for the platform as we make progress on our mission to democratize finance for all. The business is in a great position because of you and we're just getting started. And you should know our team has been working incredibly hard to deliver even more value to you. The roadmap is full. There's so much to do. And now, let's move on to questions. Yeah. I mean, echoing Jason, this is a disappointing development. We firmly believe U.S. consumers should have access to this asset class. They deserve to be on equal footing with people all over the world. And at the end of the day, we're going to defend the firm and continue to advocate for our customers. Yeah, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. First of all, we are really excited about the Gold card and the value that we're going to be providing to customers. We've seen a ton of demand. I mentioned earlier, over 1 million customers have signed up for the waitlist so far. And the product is looking great. You might have noticed we've dropped the credit card app on the app store and we've rolled it out to the first customers outside of the company. As we think about this roll out, we really want to balance the desire to get the card to customers as quickly as we can with making sure that we are managing risk to the capital well as we enter a new market for us. So, we are starting with an initial group in the tens of thousands of customers over the next few weeks. And then, we're going to observe them carefully, look at the data, watch the spending activity and the borrowing activity, and we're going to use that information to inform the broader roll out of the card. We really want to make sure that we're being very, very prudent as we do this roll out since this is a new business line for the company. Well, first, it's really been awesome to see how much interest there is in our 24 Hour Market offering. Over 10 billion in volumes have transacted in the overnight section since it launched a year ago. And we now offer overnight trading in over 900 names. And really, this is one of the core differentiators of Robinhood. You don't find this type of offering elsewhere easily. As for why trading was affected? So, in order to facilitate these trades, we route to a third-party ATS. The ATS we use went down for the evening. This affected us, but also other firms that route to it. But the ATS was able to support trading again in a handful of hours. Looking ahead, we're really on the frontier with this offering, but as we continue to invest in it, the offering will improve over time and it will get more resilient. So, believe us when we say that we're committed to making sure this offering is reliable and more feature-rich going forward. Hey, Devin. Thanks, Dan. Yeah. And I would just add, we are, of course, excited about the Q1 performance and the start to Q2. Well, I think we have some medium and longer-term tailwinds to the business. The Gold benefits that we announced in March, including the 1% deposit match, which really has resonated quite strongly with customers based on early feedback, has yet to launch. We're entering a new product category with the credit card. And we've also been working on our futures and web Pro product for active traders. And we here get an early look at the products that we're building and the teams have been working incredibly hard to make what we believe are incredibly polished products that we're very excited about. So, I think we tend to get excited about things on a quarterly basis, but we're running this business for the long-term and I think that you'll see a lot more from us. Hey, Steven. Yeah. I think you're right in that. We've been extremely selective about the assets that we offer on the platform. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have seen increases in volumes and in market share on the crypto side. I think for a long time, we were offering customers great pricing on purchasing crypto assets, but we weren't doing a great job of communicating it. And now we are communicating it through the user interface and through all sorts of marketing surfaces. And I think customers are starting to pick up on that fact. You're seeing it talked about more in social media, just how great of a deal they're getting on crypto transactions. And we're expanding in the EU where we again believe that we can provide great service and great offerings to customers. So, the crypto team has been working tremendously hard. The roadmap there is quite full. There's a lot to do to make the products experience better for customers. Yeah. I mean in terms of what drives crypto volumes, I think modulo our market share gains, our crypto activity does track the broader market. And I don't really want to get into prognosticating what the crypto market is going to do. That's obviously a difficult thing for anyone to do. It's a global market. There have been ETFs approved, as you all know. And that's why we look at market share and how we're doing relative to peers, because markets go up and down, but if our market share is growing throughout all conditions, then over the long run, we'll do very, very well on that side of the business. And that's kind of our approach across all of the asset classes for the active trader business. But the goal is also to diversify the business so that we're sort of like less reliant on volumes anywhere, in any one category to drive business results. I think that's kind of what you're starting to see in this quarter's results is really the performance of the company across all asset classes and even across wallet share with the net deposit growth numbers. Yeah. So, we have announced that we are going to be launching index options. This is part of the overall goal of giving our active traders access to the best tools and the best value for their services. So, index options are coming in Q4. We'll also be launching Futures as we've mentioned in the past. And as with any new Robinhood product, there's two areas where we'd like to stand out in the broader marketplace. One is the user experience. We want to make sure that our tools are easy for active traders to use, particularly on mobile, but also on web with the new offering that's coming there. And then economics. So, yeah, the economics, we intend to make very, very competitive, but also profitable for the company on a segment basis. So, Jason, I don't know if you want to add anything more specific there. And we should note index options trade round the clock, which is one of the reasons why they become so popular. So, we don't anticipate seeing a ton of cannibalization there. Hi, Ken. Yeah. I can start with that. I think the first thing I should note is we've invested in building a strong data science and product analytics capability from inception in the company. And I think that's starting to become a key differentiator now that AI is becoming more and more important, and now that we've started running these promotions, we look at it very closely. We can track them all sorts of ways across cohorts and different types of customer behavior. And we like what we're seeing. I think Jason mentioned earlier in the call that for the 1% matches, we've been targeting a sub-one-year payback and that's between two and three years for the 3% promotions, and the cohorts from 2023 have already paid back with 2024 looking good as well. So, we feel really good about the offering and you should see more creativity from the team going forward. I don't think that we've fully excavated what we can do with this capability that we've built. Yeah. They're probably more similar than different. One of the things that I'd highlight is they're coming in with average balances that are much higher than our typical historical customers. So, loving the quality of the assets being brought and the activity of the customers. And it's really reflected too in the comments that we are making about payback periods on these promotions that we are seeing customers engage with our products in a way that generates revenue for us. All right. Thank you guys for all the questions. And look, we love the quarter. We love where the business is heading.

And the goal over the long run is for all of our customers, all of their assets should be custodied at Robinhood and all of their financial transactions should go through Robinhood.

            "name": "Jason Warnick",
            "content": "Thanks, Vlad. It's good to speak with everyone today. As a reminder, last year we drove significant profitable growth, with revenue up 37% and adjusted EBITDA margins expanding by 36 points. In 2024, we are focused on driving another year of profitable growth and we had a strong Q1, with 40% year-over-year revenue growth and 14 points of margin expansion from a year ago. We also set records in Q1 for quarterly revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net income, and GAAP EPS. Looking more closely at our Q1 results compared to a year ago, total net revenues grew 40% to $618 million; adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $247 million; incremental margins were 75%, demonstrating the scalability of our cost structure even while we increased marketing and growth investments; and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded by 14 points to 40% as we make progress over time towards the 50%-plus levels we see from incumbents. All of this led to net income of $157 million, or $0.18 of EPS. We're pleased with our results in Q1 and we aim to continue delivering profitable growth in 2024. Now, let's move to our first quarter business results. Assets under custody finished Q1 at around -- at a record $130 billion, up 65% year-over-year. A key driver of that asset growth was strong Q1 net deposits of over $11 billion, which is more than double last year's quarterly average, and translates to a 44% annualized growth rate. We are encouraged by the breadth and durability of Q1 net deposits. So, let me share a little more color. First, we saw strong participation from both existing and new customers, with about 75% of net deposits coming from customers who've been at Robinhood for over a year. Second, we saw a nice mix of continued strong contributions from customers and wins versus brokerage incumbents. The mix was about 75% contributions from customers and 25% net wins from incumbents. And third, deposits into our platform were balanced across product categories, a little more than half of Q1 net deposits went to brokerage, another quarter went to cash sweep, and the last 20% to retirement. So overall, we are really pleased with the diversity of net deposits as customers engage with us across our platform. Looking at Q2, so far it's off to a good start as well, as April was our highest month of the year for net deposits with nearly $5 billion. And with our continued progress in early May, we've already brought in more net deposits year-to-date than the $17 billion we did in all of 2023, with most of the year still in front of us. We're also delivering growth in Robinhood Gold. As a reminder of how Gold subscribers on average compare to our customers overall, in Q1, Gold subscribers had 8 times the [assets] (ph) with an average of over $40,000, grew net deposits roughly twice as fast, and had 5 times the retirement account adoption. Gold ARPU is also multiples of our average customer, which includes annualized recurring subscription revenue approaching $100 million. And in Q1, we grew Gold subscribers to 1.7 million, up 42%, or 500,000 from last year. This momentum has continued into Q2 as we added another 140,000 Gold subscribers in April, more than half of our Q1 growth. Let's now turn to our financial results. In the first quarter, we generated net income of $157 million, up 5x sequentially as we grew revenues and stayed disciplined on expenses. Looking at Q1 revenues, transaction-based revenues increased sequentially across equities, options, and crypto, and net interest revenues grew as a result of higher balances and securities lending activity. So far in Q2, we've continued to see robust trading. In April, equity notional volumes were about $70 billion; options contracts were a monthly record of roughly $125 million; and crypto notional volumes were around $10 billion. Now let's turn to first quarter expenses. Combined adjusted OpEx and SBC was $460 million in Q1, as we stayed disciplined on expenses even as we increased investments in marketing and growth. Looking ahead, while the year is off to a strong start, we know it's important to stay disciplined on expenses. So, our full year adjusted OpEx and SBC outlook is unchanged in the range of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion. Before I pass the call back to Vlad, I want to share some perspectives about our opportunity to drive profitable growth in 2024 and the years to come by growing revenues and expanding margins. First, we believe we can continue our multi-year track record of delivering 20%-plus net deposit growth rates, supported by a young customer base gaining share of global wealth, share gains in existing markets, and expansion into new markets and product categories that give us more opportunity for growth. Second, as customer assets grow over time, we believe this will drive strong revenue growth as well. We are naturally hedged between interest rates and trading, and we continue to diversify our business as we introduce new products and enter new markets. And third, we're a technology company and a highly scalable platform with about 90% fixed costs. So, as our revenues increase, we believe we can drive significant margin expansion and free cash flow. In closing, we had a strong Q1, and we have a lot of momentum to start the second quarter. We remain focused on driving profitable growth for shareholders as we work to maximize EPS and free cash flow per share in 2024 and the years to come. Now, I'll turn the call back to Vlad. Yeah, I'll maybe start and then Vlad can add some thoughts. First, for our customers, your accounts are not affected by this. It's business as usual for Robinhood Crypto. We're, of course, disappointed to have received the notice. As you know, we've operated our crypto business in good faith. We've been very conservative in our approach in terms of coins listed and services offered. And we're a highly regulated company and have applied the same legal and compliance standards we use for our brokerage to the way we run our crypto business. So, it's disappointing to see more regulation by enforcement here. Vlad? Yeah. Thanks, Devin. It's Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. So in short, we love the economics of the match promotions that we've been running. I think I said last quarter that the payback on the 1% match is a little under a year, and on the 3% match, it's between two and three years. And we're watching that closely kind of on a monthly cohort basis with our customers. We're seeing the 2023 cohorts already paying off and 2024 is off to a great start. We mentioned on our prepared remarks too that the strength of net deposits, 44% annualized growth rate is really well-diversified between customers that have been at the company for -- have been at Robinhood for over a year, representing 75% of those net deposits. And we are also seeing that 75% cut a different way are unrelated to the promotion. So, really strong promotion response, but it's only a small part of the strength of the overall deposits for the quarter. Yeah, absolutely, Dan. I mean -- so we're seeing strong trading across equities, options, and crypto continuing into the next quarter. We're seeing strength kind of across the business as well in terms of new Gold subscribers. We mentioned and you mentioned the strength in net deposits, nearly $5 billion. So, we're really seeing great diversity of the strength. Retirement assets are now crossing over $7 billion, which is just remarkable growth and we love to see our customers saving for the long-term with us. We're going to share our metrics, I think next week on the month of April and so you'll get a fuller picture there. But it's really across the board, whether it's sec lending or trading or net deposits. Hello? Yeah, thanks for the question. So, we are not providing guidance necessarily on incremental margins. What I'd tell you is, as I've said in previous sessions, that about 90% of our cost structure is fixed, meaning that 10% of our costs kind of are variable relative to the activity of our platform. So that gives us a lot of opportunity to drop incremental revenue to the bottom-line. You're seeing us this year make a really big step up in marketing, about $100 million year-over-year is our plan to spend in marketing versus last year. And as Vlad was touching on in the last question, we are making a lot of investments and not sitting still. And even with all this step up in marketing and investments for growth, we're delivering incremental margins at 75%. So, we feel really good about that. We're going to continue to watch our costs. Excited to see revenue per employee cross over $1 million. I think that there's a lot of opportunity to expand margins going forward. Yeah, you bet. Thanks, Kyle, for the question. It's Jason. I'll go ahead and take that. The first point I'd make on the credit card is that we think it's really strategically aligned with our vision that we want to serve all of our customers' assets and process all of their financial transactions and having a great value credit card, I think is really fundamental to that vision. That said, we need to do this in a prudent way and in a way that makes sense economically for the company. And on that point, I think that we've got a few things that are going to benefit us. First of all, we're going to be able to leverage our scale. We're seeing that already play out with a low CAC. We have over 1 million customers on the waitlist with essentially no marketing dollars against that. And when you look at competitors, they're spending several hundred dollars, perhaps $500 per customer to acquire a customer. And so, we really love the low CAC opportunity to -- that leverages our platform. We're also able versus X1 to get even better economics. And for example, cost of funds, we've already been able to improve by over 300 basis points because of our strong balance sheet and because of our strength in the financial results. And so, those are a couple of areas that I'd point out. And then thirdly, I'd say that we have an opportunity to benefit because of our deeper relationship with customers. It's going to help us understand better the customers that we are underwriting and make better decisions, and over time, have an opportunity to offer collateralized cards, which would also help with our economics. As Vlad -- I'd just finished with, as Vlad pointed out, we're going to be really careful and prudent here. We're rolling it out to tens of thousands of customers and we're going to take months to look at how our customers are responding, how they're using the card, their borrowing and repayment activity, and we are going to use that to inform our broader roll out. And the last point, I would make is two-thirds of our customers are prime or higher in terms of credit rating. And so, we do have a high-quality customer base. And so together with the prudent roll out and the high-quality customers and benefiting from our scale and our deeper relationships with customers, we think we can land a good economic outcome for Robinhood. Yeah, thanks, Mike. We love the strong balance sheet, over $5 billion of corporate cash. Three ways to use the capital to the benefit of shareholders. One is just investing in our business for organic growth and you're seeing us do that with their incremental investments for growth, including the $100 million step-up in marketing this year. The second is M&A. You've seen us recently acquire X1. We have a very active Corp Dev team and we're looking at several opportunities there that can either augment our team, the talent of our team, or accelerate our product roadmap. And nothing to announce, but the team is certainly active. And then the last category is returning capital to shareholders. You saw us do that last year in the third quarter, about $600 million to purchase 5% of our outstanding shares. And so, we are deploying capital kind of across all three. In terms of hurdle rates, you'd expect us to use our cost-of-capital at least, and we are mindful of that. And nothing further to update you now on capital allocation. It was something that we're kind of constantly looking at. Hey, John. And I would just add that we've been incredibly selective in the coins that we've listed and are confident that the coin selection does not include any better securities and we continue to apply that high standard on anything that we would list on our platform. In terms of the mix element of your question on Europe, you're right, it's still a relatively modest contribution, the lion's share came from our U.S. crypto business, but we like what we're seeing, and tens of thousands of customers there. So, we'll continue investing there. Yeah, we're still working with the team on the pricing structure for index options. So, we'll have to stay tuned there. But agree with Vlad that we want it to be a great value for customers and also make a lot of sense for us economically. Yeah, absolutely. There is an impact to MAUs when crypto interest surges and we saw that in the quarter. And so that's certainly a part of it. But when I look at the activity across the quarter, it was very broad-based; equities up, options activity up, certainly crypto retirement, Gold members, net deposits. And so, we really saw an overall lift that was reflected in the engagement numbers that you're seeing. Yeah, Ken, we love that we're taking share. We love that we're winning assets against the incumbents. And in terms of your question about how durable it is in the medium to longer term, I don't see any reason with our highly scalable platform that we can't continue to offer promotions like that, especially with the attractive paybacks that we're realizing. On your question about whether it's something that could be copied by competitors, I think we could all come up with a handful of reasons why it would be challenging for them, whether it's their cost structure or just their installed base, and defending that through a promotion like that. But we love the promotions here at Robinhood. And again, we like that we are taking share."
