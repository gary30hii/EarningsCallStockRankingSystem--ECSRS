[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Thanks so much.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2021 first quarter earnings on September 24 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene.\nGene Lee: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. It has been 14 weeks since our last earnings call. I don\u2019t know about all of you, but it\u2019s felt more like 14 months, so much has happened. Over the past three months, our business changed in ways we never imagined, so I want to spend my time with you this morning trying to put it all in perspective for you, then Rick will share some of our fourth quarter and year-end results and provide our outlook for the first quarter. When I look back on all that has transpired, one thing that stands out is the resiliency of the full service dining industry. Prior to the pandemic, total annual sales for the casual dining industry was approximately $108 billion. And while I do not know how long it will take the industry to recover from the significant impact it experienced, I am confident that this category will get back to the size it once was. Our industry plays a vital role in our communities, and that was evident in how the consumer relied on restaurants over the last several months, even in a to-go-only environment. And while off-premise will continue to play an important role as we recover, we know that the consumer still wants to enjoy an in-restaurant experience. In fact, going out to a restaurant with friends and family is the number one activity consumers say they look forward to doing as the economy opens back up, and we've seen that as our dine-ins reopen across the country. As this vital industry continues to rebuild, there is tremendous opportunity to increase market share through increased on-premise demand and incremental off-premise sales. Those executing at the highest level are going to continue to win, and Darden is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. When we last spoke in March, we knew the pandemic was going to have a significant impact on our business. Our ability to manage through this crisis has been driven by our commitment to prioritize guest and team member safety, invest in our team members, provide frequent and transparent communication, leverage our digital platform, and be brilliant with the basics. The health and safety of our guests and team members has always been our top priority, and we've taken a number of steps to create a safe environment in our restaurants. From sourcing masks and other personal protective equipment for our team members to developing a contactless curbside pickup process at our brands while our dine-ins were closed. We are mindful of the trust our guests and team members place in us. Today, our health and safety commitments are focused on team member health checks, personal protective equipment, enhanced sanitation processes, social distancing, and frequent hand washing. We also provide paid sick leave for all our team members so they can stay home if they're ill. But we can't do it alone, and that is why we encourage our guests to join the online waitlist or make reservations, not enter our restaurants if they are symptomatic, wear a mask, and utilize contactless or mobile payment options where available. We continued to invest in our team members as our dine-ins closed. In addition to rolling out permanent paid sick leave, we introduced a three week emergency pay program that provided nearly $75 million of pay during the fourth quarter for our hourly team members who could not work. When emergency pay ended, we covered insurance payments and benefit deductions for hourly team members who were furloughed. As we brought hourly team members back to work to support increased to-go volume, we introduced an additional payment to help cover unexpected costs such as transportation and child care incurred as a result of the pandemic. And to recognize the unbelievable work our managers did during the quarter, we paid their target bonus for the fourth quarter. We know our people are our greatest competitive advantage. Not only were these investments the right thing to do to take care of our team members, they've also created a deeper loyalty and strengthened engagement while we've seen this pay-off as we bring our people back to work. Communication is the most important aspect of leadership during a crisis. We knew frequent and transparent communication with our team members and investors was important. Beyond daily meetings with all of our brand presidents who in turn met with their operational leaders on a daily basis, we have maintained a consistent communication cadence with our team members. Since this crisis began, I have provided regular business updates to our people and have been open and honest about the impacts to our business, and consequently the impacts to them. We took the same approach with our shareholders and the analysts by providing four business updates during the quarter. The pandemic accelerated the consumer's desire for convenience, and we saw a significant increase in digital engagement. The work we have done over the past few years investing in our digital platform to reduce friction prepared us to quickly adapt to consumer behavior and deliver on their expectations of convenience in our to-go-only environment. During this time, we have strengthened our digital platform and made meaningful progress against our digital strategy. In addition to improving the guest experience across our digital channels, our strategy is focused on using technology to help our guests easily order outside and inside the restaurant, improve the wait to be seated, streamline the order pickup process, and speed up how they pay. We've been building on our digital platform to support increased demand, and we certainly tested it like never before. During the quarter, online ordering at Olive Garden grew by more than 300% over the prior year and accounted for 58% of To Go sales. And at LongHorn, online ordering grew by 400% and accounted for 49% of To Go sales. Additionally, we accelerated our timeline and rolled out online ordering at our brands that had not yet deployed it. We also added the ability to order alcohol online for all of our brands and markets where that was allowed. Our commitment to being brilliant with the basics allowed us to remain focused on operational execution even as the environment forced us to radically change how we serve our guests. Each one of our brands did a phenomenal job delivering a new guest experience by collaborating and sharing best practices. This involved creating contact -- contactless curbside pickup that included designing what was essentially a drive-thru in our parking lots while this execution in this environment meant enabling our guests to order and pay online and have our team members seamlessly place their sealed orders in their vehicles. Our operators displayed tremendous innovation, flexibility, and passion as they continue to serve our guests. And to ensure we consistently executed at the highest level, we took the opportunity to streamline our menus, and improve our processes and procedures. With these changes, we are seeing improvements in execution and direct labor productivity. So what have we learned from all this? We've learned a lot. But most importantly, this situation has reinforced that our strategy that we developed five years ago grounded in our back-to-basics operating philosophy leveraging our four competitive advantages and cultivating a portfolio of iconic brands is still the right one today. Strong brands with loyal guests have fared better, and the trust we have earned from our guests is critical. Being brilliant with the basics by consistently delivering exceptional food, service, and atmosphere is imperative. However, we know how important safety including this are to our guests right now, and we must continue to earn their trust every day. And throughout this unprecedented time we have been benefited greatly from our four competitive advantages. Our significant scale, our extensive data and insights, our regular strategic planning and our culture; whether sourcing PPE for our team members, ensuring we're not impacted by supply chain issues or sharing best practices across eight brands, the ability to leverage just scale has allowed us to quickly react to constant change. Finally, as I said earlier, we know our people are our greatest competitor advantage. And I'm impressed by how our team members responded and continue to respond to take care of our guests and each other. Having a strong culture has been part of our DNA since we were founded. We were able to keep the majority of our managers employed and we stayed connected with our furloughed hourly team members. This allowed us to bring our people back quickly and get our dinings opened safely without any delays. As you saw in our press release, 91% of our dinings have reopened with at least limited capacity. We have also brought 60,000 furloughed restaurant team members back-to-work and we expect to bring at least another 40,000 back as business continues to improve. I'm incredibly proud that our culture is actually strengthened during this most difficult period in our company's history. This, above all else is what gives me confidence in Darden's future. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you Gene and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2020 was on track for a solid year of performance and the beginning of Q4 was no different. The first few weeks of sales were strong and then nearly overnight, the impact of COVID-19 required us to pivot to a To Go only format. This posed unprecedented challenges for our restaurant and support center teams and I am proud of how everyone moved quickly to increase To Go sales, reduce costs, manage working capital and improve efficiency. The simplifications Gene referenced helped to reduce key variable expenses in our restaurants especially direct labor. The teams also worked to reduce or eliminate other fixed costs in our restaurants and restaurant support center as well as eliminate non-essential capital spending. Given the significant reduction in cash flow, we also had to work quickly to ensure we had enough cash for whatever might occur. During the quarter we suspended the dividend and share repurchases, fully drew down our $750 million credit facility, took out a $270 million term loan and raised over $500 million in a follow on equity offering. All these efforts, and the strong loyalty of our guests resulted in us tripling our prior To Go sales run rate averages, and materially reducing our cash burn as we disclosed to you through our periodic business updates. Given the confidence in our cash flow trends and the ability to access it in the future, we fully repaid our credit facility in early May. Now turning to the results. The total sales were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 43.0%. Same-Restaurant sales decreased 47.7% and adjusted diluted net loss per share was $1.24. Because of the significant reduction in total sales compared to last year, all of the expense lines experience sales deleverage, so I'll just touch on a few highlights. First, Food and Beverage costs were higher as a percent of sales given menu mix related to both To Go mix and simplified menus, as well as increased packaging expense and elevated beef cost. As we look at the labor line, there was significant deleverage in management labor, including approximately $25 million in manager bonuses. However, we saw an improvement in hourly labor as a percent of sales of over 150 basis points even with a substantial reduction in sales. Restaurant expenses per operating week decreased over 20% given our focus on cost management, even as we incurred over $5 million in incremental cleaning supplies and PPE related to COVID-19. For marketing and G&A expense, we were able to reduce the absolute spend by $37 million and $17 million respectively versus last year. Included in our restaurant labor, and to a small extent G&A is approximately $50 million of investment net of retention credit. This was related to emergency and furlough pay for our team members while they were not working. This negatively impacted our EPS by $0.30 which was not adjusted out of reported earnings. During the quarter, we impaired $390 million of assets as a result of lower sales, reduced profitability and lower market to capitalization. The impairments related to $314 million of Cheddar\u2019s goodwill and trademark assets, $47 million of restaurant level assets and $29 million of other assets. We permanently closed eleven restaurants in the quarter, six of which were already impaired. The entire $390 million of impairment charges were adjusted out of our reported earnings. We ended the quarter with $763 million in cash and another $750 million available in our credit facility. This gives us over $1.5 billion of liquidity available to weather the crisis and make appropriate investments to grow profitably. Our adjusted debt-to-adjusted capital at the end of the quarter was 61% well within our debt covenant of 75%. As we shifted to an off-premise only model, we took a disciplined approach to pursue sales opportunities, with an eye toward incremental profitability and cash flow by focusing on cost management and the guest experience, while ensuring our team members were taken care of. This approach resulted in a better finish to Q4 than anticipated and is the underpinning for the strength of our business model that is reflected in our first quarter financial outlook. Now turning to fiscal 2021 performance. In today's release, we provided quarter-to-date same restaurant sales and the performance of our restaurants with dining rooms at least partially open. These results are encouraging with last week's blended same-restaurant sales down 30%, we are operating cash flow positive at these levels. Our To Go sales remain elevated in restaurants with dining rooms at least partially reopened. Olive Garden To Go sales are approximately double their pre-COVID averages and LongHorn has more than tripled their pre-COVID averages and LongHorn has more than tripled their pre-COVID averages in these restaurant. While it is our normal practice to provide an annual financial outlook, due to the uncertainty in business performance moving forward, we are only providing an outlook for the first quarter. We expect to achieve approximately 70% of prior year sales levels, total EBITDA of at least $75 million and diluted net earnings per share of greater than or equal to zero on a diluted share base of 131 million shares. At this point, we don't intend to further share intra quarter business updates since we have provided our first quarter outlook. For the full year, we intend to open between 35 and 40 net new restaurants. Our first opening of the year is expected to be in early July, with a few others likely to be opened by the end of the first quarter. In total, we expect between $250 million and $350 million of capital spending for fiscal 2021. Turning to other aspects of capital allocation. As you recall we suspended our dividend last quarter due to the level of cash flow uncertainty and the need to preserve as much cash as possible. We have been consistent in our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, and our dividend is a big part of that. As soon as we see the business begin to generate the sustainable cash flows to support a dividend and repay our term loan, we will have discussions with our board on our dividend policy. And now I'll turn it back to Gene for some closing comments.\nGene Lee: Thanks, Rick. And as you've seen in our 8-K filing this morning, Dave George will be retiring on August 2nd. Dave will celebrate his 65th birthday later this year, and we've been discussing this transition for some time. Dave and I have been partners on this journey for 23 years. It was a joint venture partner for LongHorn when I joined RARE in 1997. I still remember the first time I met him. We're going to visit his restaurant, so he picked me up at the airport in his Volvo, with no air conditioning in the North Carolina heat. I knew at the end of the day that Dave was a special operator. I wasted no time we bought out his interest in his joint venture and brought him into the company. Over the last 23 years Dave has been a successful in every one of his leadership positions. He has led three of Darden\u2019s iconic brands; the Capital Grille LongHorn Steakhouse and Olive Garden, and most recently he served as our Chief Operating Officer. He built great teams and became a mentor to many operators and executives. His can do approach and attitude permeates throughout Darden in each of our brands today. For many of the last 23 years, Dave and I have had lunch together on Monday to discuss what happened the previous week and talk about what needed to get done going forward. Not much has changed over those 23 years except today; we order salads instead of two or three entries each. And for the last five years, David sat next to me during every hour earnings call as he is today helped me find the details I need to answer your questions. I'll miss seeing him when I walk into the room on these days. For all the Darden team members listening today, our annual conference which usually happens in August would have been a great opportunity for everyone to see Dave, thank him and wish him well in person. Unfortunately, because of COVID-19, our conference has been postponed until next year. We will however be inviting Dave to our conference in 2021, and he's committed to come so we can celebrate all he's done for Darden and for many of you. In closing, I want to say thank you to all our team members, those currently working and those who remain on furlough. And as I've said to you repeatedly, your ability to adapt, innovate and collaborate during this time has truly been inspiring. Thank you for your on-going commitment to our guests and each other. And now we\u2019ll open up it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. First, I want to pass on my congratulations to Dave George on a very successful career and wish him the best as he retires. So Gene, I guess my big picture question is related to what you think the environment could look like on the other side?\nGene Lee: I lost you \u2013 did I lose you just -- you there, David.\nDavid Tarantino: Can you hear me, okay?\nGene Lee: I lost you. Last word I heard was on the other side. Is there a period after that or --?\nDavid Tarantino: No. Gene, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you think the environment will look on the other side of the pandemic especially as it relates to the competition and the potential for unit closures, and how you're positioning Darden to potentially take advantage of that type of environment, whether it\u2019s potential to grow faster or how do you think about those dynamics as you look longer term? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes. Good morning, David. Yes, I think that as I said in my prepared remarks. We went into this as a $108 billion category, and I've been really impressed with the resiliency of the consumer and how important full service casual dining has been in everyday life of our guests. So, I think the industry gets back to where it was. I think it's important. I think people really miss it, probably miss it more than they know. There's been a lot of predictions of how much capacity will come out of the system. I'm not going to sit here today and say I know what the exact number is. The one thing I do believe is there'll be -- there'll be less competition as we -- and less restaurants as we move forward, and I think that's a great opportunity for us. I think scale is going to matter more than ever. I think that you know we believe that we can get back to 2% to 3% unit growth pretty quickly. We're going to continue to open restaurants. We\u2019re going to continue to do new deals. We think the economics going forward here in the short term should get better for us on new restaurant development, and I think we'll go back to our basics. We're going to continue to try to improve our food offerings. We're going to try to make sure we have the right value that we're offering the consumer. As we mentioned in both our comments this morning, we've improved productivity in our restaurants through more streamlined menus. So, we think the opportunity is there. We also think that off-premise will play a bigger role as we move forward. We think our capabilities in that have improved dramatically over the last 14 weeks, and we -- and I think a lot of consumers have had the opportunity to maybe use our service off-premise that hadn't used it before. I think they were really pleased with the overall experience.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. And then, Gene you mentioned kind of streamlining the operations and the menus. Is that something you think will continue longer term or do you see that maybe some of the items coming back that you removed?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think -- I think David, each brand\u2019s in a different place. Each brand went to a different place when they went off premise only, so some brands I would say right now are probably back to 100% of where they will want to be other than maybe some promotional items here and there. Other brands still have 10%, 15% that they need to add back to their menus to make them competitive. But it was not only the menu. I mean, I think when we basically closed down the operation except for off-premise, we had the chance to rebuild as we opened back up and we had a chance to look at all our processes and procedures, and I think we were able to simplify and eliminate a lot of prep work in some of our businesses that we'll never get back into the business. I think these are costs that we're going to -- we've gotten out. We've had a lot of discussion around our table is that it's been much easier as we build the on-premise business back up to reimagine what the operation in the back of house looks like versus trying to reimagine it why you're operating. And we're really thrilled with the results so far.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. Thanks very much and good luck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. Also would like to wish Dave George a very happy retirement. Congrats on a wonderful career. Gene, I know during this pandemic you've instituted lower order price thresholds for delivery across the Olive Garden portfolio. What are the insights and maybe the impacts you're seeing from this, and what are your updated thoughts on that opportunity as this environment has so rapidly changed these last few months?\nGene Lee: We've run a lot of tests there, David. I think where we're settling in right now is $50 minimum, it\u2019s still the 5 o'clock call the day -- the day before. We find that to be the sweet spot. The average order size is still well above that. We didn't see any benefit of going below that threshold. And so, that's where we're going \u2013 that\u2019s what we're netting out and we think that, that opportunity will continue to be there. I won't -- we will tell you that we did test doing our own delivery, found it really inefficient, and it wasn't that additive. And so, we're really focused on this curbside operation and think that's the future for off premise.\nBrian Bittner: Okay. And my follow up is just -- it's interesting to see the LongHorn sales recovery occur a bit more rapidly than Olive Garden, you know particularly in units that have reopened their dining rooms. Gene, what do you really attribute that to, and you know I ask that question in the spirit of the fact that To Go sales in the open LongHorn units are actually much lower than Olive Garden. So, I'm surprised we're seeing such a big recovery in LongHorn versus Olive Garden more recently.\nGene Lee: Yes. You know Brian two things to consider. First of all, geography is working for LongHorn. We've got the state of Georgia. We have a huge presence there, and business has come back real strong. I would also say that the Olive Garden dining room yields a higher percentage of tables available in -- with the occupancy restrictions than Olive Garden does. And so I want to take this opportunity to talk just a little bit about occupancy. A lot of people have done a lot of work on this and I think that you're -- I think you need to think about just a little bit differently. Once your past 25% occupancy the only thing that matters is there is six feet of social distancing required. Remember, there's always significant inefficiencies in your seating capacity. We've always got twos and fours -- fours and sixes. We've got tables for large parties. Our average party side is two point three. So different layouts even in different -- inside the same brand will yield you different seating efficiencies. We will be installing temporary barriers in approximately 100 restaurants in the next two weeks to try to improve this efficiency especially in Olive Garden. We want to do that while maintaining the social distancing requirements. We'll analyze the sales growth after that we've installed those barriers and decide how many more restaurants we want to add it -- added to. So that's a long answer to your question, but I think that there's some confusion out there and we have to remember that once you're past 25% occupancy, that's six foot restriction on social distancing trumps any other restriction there is, because you can't get to 50%.\nBrian Bittner: Understood. Thanks for the color, Gene.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJohn Glass: Thanks. Thanks very much. I will. And congratulations to Dave on your retirement. I wanted to ask about incremental margins as you think about the recovery. So you know COVID has made a lot of businesses including yours, rethink how you do things, you talk about menu simplification, but you also talked about this heavier to go mix made influence food costs. Do you think as your AUVs recover that you're able to get back to higher margins [Technical difficulty]\nGene Lee: Hey John, thanks for the question. As it relates to margins incrementally going forward, right now if you look at our P&L and the way our margins looked, our margins are better on a variable cost basis than they were coming into the pandemic. So if we don't make other investments going forward, you would anticipate our margins to be a little bit better than they were before. However, we're still making decisions on what we'll do as the sales continue to grow, whether we bring some things back or invest in our guest even more to grow sales even faster. So, I don't want to comment too much on what our margin structure is going to look like in a year or two years, because we may make choices that take away some of that margin gain that we had or we may let that margin flow to the bottom line. But as of right now, our variable margins are better than they were coming into the pandemic.\nJohn Glass: Okay. Thanks. And then, Gene, just following up on your question about the To Go being your -- or your curbside being the preferred off-premise channel. Did you take the opportunity to test third-party in this period of time? Do you look at your results and say, they are just as good as many of your peers with third parties? So, what's the advantage? I mean, how do you conclude or look at this period of change in any way your view on third-party or maybe stiffing your resolve against it?\nGene Lee: John. We've had third-party delivery in some of our restaurants even before the pandemic started including some Olive Gardens, the lot of Yard House. And we actually added some third-party delivery in Yard House in a different state. And we really didn't see that the third-party delivery grew faster than our own To Go business. Our own To Go business actually grew faster than the third-party business in those restaurants. And so, we're still at the point where we believe that our off-premise business is really strong and continues to grow. And we are not anticipating, launching a third-party delivery model. Now, as we've said all the time that can change as soon as we see or if we see that those margins are equal to what we do today then maybe we'll go into the third-party model. But as of right now, our resolve is strong. We believe that doing off-premise the way we do it, especially now that we've added this significant curbside business is the way to go.\nJohn Glass: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nGregory Francfort: Sure. Thank you very much. And Dave, congratulations on retirement. I have two questions. The first is a follow-up, just to the capacity restraints. I guess, the point that average party size is lower in Olive Garden, which is what's creating the six foot distancing. I think the 2.3 was overall. But I think we're just trying to understand that point. And then, the other question I had was just on off-premise and how much maybe that could look like in a fully recapture scenario. How are you guys looking at it? Because you guys give some data in the release that maybe it's like a third of prior sales volumes now or 60% of what the peak kind of off-premise was. But I'm curious how you guys are thinking about that and trying to figure out what that would look like in terms of size after this? Thanks.\nGene Lee: As far as capacity for Olive Garden goes, I don't really think it has -- the party size has an impact on that. It just more the way the physical layout is. And we have a lot more room. We have rooms. We have less boost. And so, we\u2019re trying to create that six feet is more difficult. Remember, some of our smaller rooms are offset. They're family tables, they're larger parties. Olive Garden does a lot of that. But the majority of our buildings right now - because the booth backs are less than six feet. We can correct the same yield. If we - and we adhering to the local jurisdictions. If we adhere to those local jurisdictions we can't create the same percentage occupancy in mostly Olive Gardens that we can in LongHorn. And that's why putting some of these temporary barriers that we're building in there could help increase the yield. And what we're seeing. We're seeing - I think, when we talk about Olive Garden, we need to focus on the absolute sales number, which is significant. And as we get towards the weekend our percentages come down a little - I mean, get a little bit tougher to keep up, right? So the bigger, bigger days that we have an Olive Garden are harder to match. Early in the week, our year-over-year sales declines are little bit less. As far as off-premise, I think that -- we believe off-premise will play a bigger role going forward. I'm not so sure that we expect to kind of keep these run rate once we get back to a normal environment as long as there's a threat of COVID and people have modified their personal behaviors that we think off-premise business will continue to stay robust. We think this will be a contributor going forward. We think when we level out we'll be at higher percentages of off-premise in all of our businesses. While I can't sit here today and say what I think that percentage is going to be. I do think it will be greater.\nGregory Francfort: Thanks, Gene.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thanks. And I just also want to extend best wishes to Dave on your next chapter. Two separate ones from me. One for Rick. Can you talk philosophically for how you arrived at 1Q guidance for sales. Was this more top-down or bottoms up just in -- what recent news as the virus spreads in some key states for Darden?\nRick Cardenas: Well, Andrew, it was actually both. I mean, we did a top-down look at where we are geographically. What we've been running lately. And our brands did our own bottom-up look at it by geography et cetera, and we came to around the same number. And so, if you look at what we have, we're seeing approximately 70%, which is where we are after three weeks of this quarter. Now mind you, the restaurants that are open, with dining rooms open are doing a little bit better than that. But we just want to make sure that we don't know exactly when all the dining rooms are going to open. We don't know when if there's going to be another wave or of some closures. We're hoping that doesn't happen. But that's where we came up with our 70% number for sales. And then on the profit side, as you saw in our fourth quarter, we did much better job in controlling costs and expenses and everything else. And so, we just have a stronger business model, which makes us feel comfortable with our EPS of zero or greater and a $75 million or greater EBITDA. And that's total EBITDA in that restaurant level, that everything.\nAndrew Charles: That\u2019s helpful. And then question for you, Gene. Looking beyond the 35 to 40 openings plan for 2021, can you talk about how you'll be able to achieve 2% to 3% restaurant growth in shorter term rather than the longer term? But can you talk about how the pandemic has changed your practices for site selection as well as change the restaurant prototype to help maximize ROI for what looks to be more off-premise curbside-focused future?\nGene Lee: Yes. I would say, it's too early to say, its really changed our philosophy on new restaurant development at this point. But one thing I do believe is the economics are going to be more favorable than they were pre-COVID. I think that they'll be a lot less people growing out there. So I think the cost of construction should come down just like it did in '09, '10, and '11. I think the cost of the underlying land should come down significantly. And so, as we look forward I think the economics look promising. The best restaurant deals we did were after the recession in '09 and '10 especially for our specialty brands. So we'll push hard on that to get favorable economics where it possible. I do think that as we look at these businesses transition to more curbside than folks coming into a restaurant that picking up the take-out order. And we still don't know how we get back to a normal environment. How that's going to migrate back. Will this going to stay 100% curbside or people are going to want to come in. We've got to really go to that discovery process. I think the big work that needs to be done is to think about what do we need to do inside the box to better support and stage curbside, if its going to be that big part of our business. Up until recently in our existing restaurant we been doing remodels to create capacity for inside pickup. Now we got a really re-look at that as we go forward. We have been developing an Olive Garden more of a dedicated pickup space off the side of the kitchen that we are really happy with. But that might not be the way we want to go going forward. We don't know. And so, we'll see as we move forward. I think we'll try to build a little more flexibility in our dining rooms and think about different barriers and our floor plans. So that if something like this happened in the future we might have more flexibility. But I'm actually -- I'm really excited about the opportunity to build restaurants. I'm confident in our model. I believe the cost -- the initial investment cost is going to be less or at least not be inflating at the rate it was inflating. So we're going to be able to create significant value for Darden going forward with new restaurant growth and we'll probably be one of the few out there that's opening new restaurants.\nAndrew Charles: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nEric Gonzalez: Thank you so much. And I also like to add my congrats to David. Based on the discussion we had earlier about the occupancy in Olive Garden versus LongHorn. I just wondering if you could speak to why it seems that the off-premise sales perhaps are being little bit -- cannibalize little bit more at Olive Garden versus LongHorn? And then, my second question relates to the promotional environment. It seems like very few of your competitors are discounting or even advertising right now. I know, you had that $12.99 [ph] promo earlier this month. But wondering, when you think the right time to restart the promotional schedule? And how you think the competition is setting up with regards to advertising deals? Thanks.\nGene Lee: On the first question, I think -- I mean, LongHorn just started at a much lower level for off-premise and that's why it's growing at three times and not two times. I don't think there's anything more to that. I think the absolute dollars going outside on Olive Garden. Our on-take out are impressive. I mean, they have some of the CD levels of overall sales. I mean, those are impressive numbers. If you look at 40% last week on $81,000 per week. I mean, that's a huge business. So, I wouldn't read anything else into that other than LongHorn started at a much lower level. As far as promotional go --promotions go, we've pulled back. Obviously, we've pulled back on almost all promotional activity. You're seeing us do a little bit of television Olive Garden because we own the spots. We bought them in the upfront. And so we need to -- we'll continue to advertise there. Right now, we don't think it's prudent to be promoting people into our restaurants when we have long waits to get into the dining rooms. Well, I think we would just be creating more frustration for our guests who can't get in. And so, at some point maybe we'll do some more off-premise advertising. But right now, we're looking -- we're taking this opportunity to cleanse our marketing spend to understand as we put it back in what works better. What gets us the highest return on investment as we as we put it back into the system? And when that's going to be a big opportunity, again, this is where scale will matter. We can come back in and advertise our businesses at the right time. We don't think this is the right time to be advertising. We think this is the right time to pull it back, analyze the situation and we'll make it -- whenever its doing this -- when the situation is right, then we'll start to layer some advertising back in and promotion back in.\nAndrew Charles: Helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nChris Carroll: Thanks. Good morning and good to hear from you all. And congratulations to Dave on his retirement. So Gene, you referenced Georgia Performance regarding recent LongHorn strength. So following up on that, can you provide any additional detail on what you're seeing more broadly in the states that were among the first to allow dining rooms to reopen? Are you seeing sales in those states meaningfully different than that of your overall average? And how is off-premise mixing in those states now versus the average? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Well, I think that -- I'll answer the first question -- last question first. The off-premises is strong. It's maintaining. Wouldn't see no change in off-premise in those states for the most part. As far as how those states are performing against others and all depends I think on what your brand strength is and what your relative share is in those markets. So obviously, when you look at LongHorn in Atlanta Georgia, we've got the largest share of voice there. I mean, we have 45 restaurants in the DMA. We're very trusted brand. We are borne out of LongHorn -- out of Atlanta. And so, I think people just trust the brand. And so, where we have great brand strength whether it's a Cheddar's market that has great brand strength. There an Olive Garden Market that has great brand strength. Those restaurants come back faster and perform at a higher level. And so, I don't think it really has to do with as much as when the state opened, as much as what's the brand strength in those specific markets. Another example is where we do really well in LongHorn Cincinnati is another one of those early markets. And we came back strong in Cincinnati as soon as we opened. But that's true in for Cheddar's in certain markets, is true for Olive Garden in certain markets.\nChris Carroll: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much and congrats, Dave. That's a long time to be having weekly lunch with Gene. So congratulations. Just one question, one follow-up. Just in terms of the question, the changes you've discussed that you've made during COVID. I'm just wondering maybe you can prioritize a few of that you think maybe a good business and will remain post-COVID. I know you mentioned curbside and we talked about delivery. But thoughts around social distancing or I know you mentioned the online waitlist and reservations and the reduced menu. I'm just wondering if any of those you see is kind of more permanent. And then I had one follow-up.\nGene Lee: Well, the most permanent and the most significant thing we've done is streamline the menus and our processes and procedures and that's forever. This was the opportunity that a lot of us have been waiting for. When we closed down our dining rooms and we knew we had to simplify for the off-premise. And then we had those three or four weeks to really focus at the corporate level with our teams. They say, okay, what do we really need to come back. And how do we keep this simple. Because we had no idea what was going to happen when we opened our dining rooms. We didn't know when it was going to show up. And so we had these simple menus out there. They're all disposable. We knew that we could change them quickly if we needed to. But what we learned was, we could get enough variety on the menus to satisfy the demand of the consumer. And we could simplify it because we want to make sure we didn't have as much labor in the back of the house to execute it. So to me that's the biggest thing our teams have done. And that's been the biggest insight on that -- some of the --what I would call this superfluous menu items that are on our menu that one out of 100 people that were buying when they were coming in just aren't important. And most of those created the complexity in the kitchen. And so with this one -- hopefully once in a lifetime opportunity we were able to pull those out. And I think that's what's going to be the lasting change. It's going to have significant impact two, three, four years from today.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got you. And then my follow-up was just. It was mentioned earlier about the reinfections and seems like it's ramping up in recent days and weeks. So I'm just wondering if there's any color you can give directionally in states we've seen recent spikes. How your business maybe changes. Or maybe how your approach to decisions is going to change versus the first time whether speed to close or duration of closure. Just wondering what you've seen where those spikes have happened and how your business -- or how you might change a process of making decisions this go around versus the first? Thank you. \nGene Lee: I would just say real quickly. We've seen no change in our business trends in the states that are starting to spike. Obviously, we're concerned, we're focused on it. But as a leadership team, we always talk about, let's focus on what we can control, right? We can't control it. We're not doctors. We're not in the government. Folks are going to do what their leadership inside the states are going to do what they're going to do. What we -- if we're focused a pivot again to more restrictions in restaurant dining or even if we to go back all the way to an off-premise, we can pivot that way. It's going to be a lot easier this time to pivot that way, because we know we're going to do. We know how to do it. Last time we were kind of making it up as we were going. We made a lot of right decisions as we did that. But this time it would be a lot smoother for us to pivot back to on off-premise. Its only experienced for a short period of time. I think the difference this time is that this will be micro, not macro. And that's how we're thinking about it. And that we've got a team setup to manage day-to-day what's happening in these local municipalities. And we'll adjust. But as we think about it as a management and a leadership team is, we're going to control what we can control and we're not going to worry about things that we can't control.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJeff Farmer: Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on the question that Jeff just asked. So I appreciate that you said that so far you're not seeing much of a change. But just drilling down a little bit from that level. Again, is there any type of like a pivot back to off-premise from on-premise, reduced frequency? It sounds like you're seeing that. At least as it relates to the overall volume levels you haven't seen much of a change. But in terms of consumer behavior or taking a little bit of a deeper dive to see how those consumers are behavior -- this consumers are behaving in those states that have seen a dramatic jump in COVID cases. Is there anything you can add beyond what you've already answered for Jeff's questions?\nGene Lee: No. Peter, I mean, we're talking here six or seven days since we've really seen something. We haven't seen any change in any behavior at this point in time that we can call out. Who knows? Maybe some will change tomorrow. I don't know. But right now there's nothing for us to say that can add any value to this topic.\nJeff Farmer: And then just one other follow-up question. So is it possible for some of these restaurants that are operating at 50%, 60%, 75% capacity to put up positive same-store sales numbers. Can they actually again grow sales year-over-year positive comps with that 50% to 75% capacity constraint?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. As of today we have somewhere between 10% to 15% of our restaurants that are putting up positive same restaurant sales. There are restaurants that have good solid off-premise business. And they've got a business that kind of goes all day. There an trade areas where even early in the week you've got business from two to five and after eight. So 10% to 15% of our restaurants today are positive same restaurant sales.\nJeff Farmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you. I wanted to echo the congrats to Dave as well. Gene, I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about value. I know you said, you don't really want to promote right now. But it also seems like you've got some labor productivity benefits in your back pocket with about 150 basis points of productivity. So you've got some margin I guess to spend. How are you thinking about value maybe over the next couple months or maybe a couple of quarters? It seems like we're going to be in a relatively high unemployment environment and competition is coming more back on line. Just try to understand your perspective on value going forward?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think it's real simple. Once we the capacity and if we see any let-up in demand, then we can pivot to value. We have that opportunity to invest in value to drive traffic. At this point it just doesn't make any sense, because we have no capacity to drive it to.\nPeter Saleh: Understood. And then just my second question is on the -- you just talked about a competitive advantage and extensive data and insights that you guys have. Do you see anything in the data that would move you more towards a loyalty program or away from a loyalty program in the future as things normalize? Has anything changed there in this environment?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Peter, this is Rick. Something did changed during this environment. We actually canceled our loyalty program test. And that ended at the end of the fiscal year. And it ended for a couple of reasons. One is, we've had it out there for a while. We had seen some incremental improvement over time. But we just didn't think this is the right time to continue to invest in that. We wanted to streamline everything we were doing. That said, there is a chance that we'll bring one back in the future. We did get some good data out of a loyalty test. So the data is richer than the data that we get from our credit cards and other things. The real question was, do we have enough of that to utilize to market and to do the right things? And so, we cancel the test again to streamline to ensure that we're focusing on the things that are most important right now. That said, we may come back with another loyalty program in the future.\nPeter Saleh: Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning. Dave, I want to wish you all the best during your retirement. I've really enjoyed covering your career at RARE and Darden. So I just have a couple of questions. Rick, the first quarter guidance implies no improvement in the current trend. So, I'm wondering if you're anticipating sales could be impacted when the supplemental unemployment benefits expire.\nRick Cardenas: Well, everything that we're anticipating is in our guidance. They could be impacted. That said, we don't know if they're going to be expanded, right. Are they're going to be extended or they can be extended at different dollar amount. There's still some discussions along those lines. And so, we put everything in there. There's some positives in that could happen or some negatives can happen. And that's why we felt that our 70% sales number against last year was the right number.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Okay. And then the company had 43% sales decline in the fourth quarter and lost about a $1.25 and adjusted earnings. Expect 30% sales decline in the first quarter and earnings to breakeven. Can you give us further a little more explanation as to what are the key line items driving that improvement in earnings sensitivity?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. A couple of things. One is, we had $58 million of costs that we did not adjust out of our earnings that we won't have in this quarter. As we talked about before, the $58 million of investments that we made, $50 million of that was definitely -- not definitely, but it was an impact that we wouldn't expect to happen going forward. That's one. And two. When we came into this and started declining fast, it took us a little bit of time to get some of those costs out, right? So, you go from a positive sales in one week to negative 75% and within a couple of weeks it takes you a little bit of time to move those costs. Now, we have all the fixed costs where we like them. And so with a 70% sale -- so a 30% reduction versus last year we can be profitable.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Okay, great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Go ahead please Your line is open.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. I have two questions. One about unit growth and one a follow-up on margins. The new units, we had actually anticipated that you might have much lower unit growth just because there might be constraints on construction or permitting that kind of thing. Could you just talk about what -- whether we should expect openings to be more back end loaded? Or if the pace is sort of level loaded or more like normal? And then, I guess the other -- and what brand would we expect to see? Is it safe to assume Olive Garden and LongHorn given the volume recovery there? So that's the first question just on unit\u2019s cadence and brand.\nRick Cardenas: Sara, this is Rick. In terms of opening cadence for the year, recall, we stopped construction in the fourth quarter. And a lot of those restaurants were either done or close to done. So the restaurant that's opening in July was pretty much already completed. And so, we will have some restaurants that can open quickly if we want them to. We're opening as I said one in July. We've got probably handful more that will open by the end of the quarter. And that we're doing to make sure that we can train in social distancing and make sure that we're training the teams correctly. And then after that we've got a lot of and that can open. As soon as we think that we can serve the guests need that's coming into that restaurant. And so, we can flip the switch fairly quickly. But the likelihood is it'll be a little bit more backend loaded just because we want to see what the environment is before we open a restaurant at limited capacity.\nSara Senatore: Got it. And the question I had about margins. Sorry did you say which banners you might be opening Olive Garden, LongHorn. Or is it sort of look back at historical rates in this. What the right mix?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. I would look back at historical. Our plan this year is to open at least one restaurant for every brand. And some of them again, we're already under construction. But the majority of our openings will be Olive Garden and LongHorn.\nSara Senatore: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then just on the margin follow-up. Can you just give a little more color. You talked about labor savings, but I'm also trying to understand when we look at the margin complexion sort of food, labor, other, how much of that is difference in off-premise versus on-premise? And what those margins look like? Or was there mix? I know, if LongHorn is doing slightly better I think that is negative for food but good for Labor. Just trying to understand how much of this is sort of the expense management and the efficiencies that you found versus business mix?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Sarah. Cost of sales was unfavorable to us in the fourth quarter. A lot of it because of mix in brands, mix in To Go business and the higher expense for packaging. Unlike other brands we actually put our packaging costs in our cost of sales. It's not in restaurant expenses; it\u2019s in cost of sales. So when you think about how much we shifted To Go and we had some value platforms in To Go, Olive Garden did buy one take one for almost the whole time for To Go. So that was a higher cost of sales. We had we had To Go packaging for more entrees than normal. We had bundles at some of the other brands. So it was really a mix up To Go and mix of what we were selling. And then brand mix is a little bit of that. But it's not too much, except for the fact that our higher end brands actually had a lower same restaurant sale, so a bigger negative. And some of those brands have a fairly good cost of sales measure. On the labor front, it was all deleverage as we talked about -- as I talked about in the prepared remarks. We had restaurant managers we paid them even when they were on furlough. We had -- we kept most of our restaurant managers throughout this downturn. We had the $58 million of those expenses that Gene mentioned. That was in our restaurant labor. Primarily there was a little bit in G&A, but most of it was in restaurant labor. So that hurt our margin on that front too. Those are things that we don't expect to continue. What we do expect to continue is deleverage in the restaurant manager labor line because that's a fixed cost. But we do have some as we said some favorability on the hourly labor side.\nSara Senatore: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Setyan from Wedbush Securities. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nNick Setyan: Thank you. Appreciating that. We don't really know what happens to the incremental $600 a week or are there stimulus measures going forward. I mean -- but is there a sense kind of looking back internally around the extent to which the stimulus measures contributed to date to the sales recovery? That's my first question. And then, I have a follow up.\nGene Lee: And I think -- when you think about stimulus, I would say, it's definitely a positive. I'm not sure we can quantify how positive it is. And I would say that yes, right now there is -- we think it's -- some of that's going to go away at the end of July. But I have to -- you have to -- at least I think that the government's going to have to add some other stimulus to the economy that should be positive to us and it just may come to us to a different vehicle. And so, I expect the overall economy to have stimulus in it. I don't think it'll come in the same form as it's coming today. But I think that we'll get our fair share of it.\nNick Setyan: And you have given your experience and you've navigated through a number of Psycho. What's your sense that even if the capacity constraints are completely normalized, but we're in a low sort of teens or high single digit in unemployment environment. What's your sense in terms of where sales eventually do stabilize? And then just structurally around sort of the fine dining business or Yard House business given its exposure to malls et cetera. How do we think about those businesses in the medium to longer term?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think what you're asking me is impossible to predict right now. Because what we -- we don't really understand the competitive situation. We don't understand how many competitors are going to be out there. We don't understand the stimulus that the government going to put it in. So I don't know where this levels out. But I do think it's important to note that our fine dining businesses and most of primary all our specialty businesses are going to return to normal more slowly than I think casual dining will return to normal. Primarily because Capital Grille, Eddie V's rely on business travel and entertainment as a big part of their sales. And we saw that in '09 and '10, the businesses do shift. You become more weekend-focused in fine dining and in an environment like this. And we're already seeing that shift that our weekends are actually fairly good in fine dining. Our Midweek business is weak. And so, I think to sum it up, the specialty brands are going to -- are going to come back a little bit lower especially in some of -- like some of the yard houses that are tied to ballparks or stadiums or something like L.A. Live, as those areas come -- those entertainment areas come back slower. They will have some tough sledding going forward there. But I don't know where this all ends up. All I do know is that with our strategy and we believe with our scale and our competitive advantages that we are positioned to gain market share as we move forward. And I'm confident in that. And I believe the investments we've made in our people are going to be the biggest advantage we have.\nNick Setyan: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks for the question. And Gene thanks for the commentary on capacity constraints. Just wanted to follow-up on Jeff's question about kind of getting those AUVs headed back towards flat or positive. Just wondering if you could talk a bit more about the things you can do other than the partitions to increase capacity. Your capacity utilization while the restrictions are in place. And maybe even more broadly in addition to the capacity utilization, just speaking to some of the other key things that you can do to drive that AUV recovery with those restrictions in place? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Well, I think it's tough. I think that that's -- we're balancing how much do we want. How much capital we want to invest in some sort of temporary solution. If you asked me two weeks ago, I would have thought they were on a better path to being able to see all the restrictions lifted. Obviously that has changed here in the short term. So there's not -- I don't think there's much more that we can do than create some physical barriers without ruining the atmosphere in the restaurants to create capacity. I mean, some of our folks have been really creative with outside seating, which I applaud, and I hope they continue to do that. But then, as we get into the summer months down south, that gets more difficult because of the thunderstorms and things like that. So I really don't see. I think we have to learn to live with what the restrictions are until such time they're removed.\nDennis Geiger: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nNicole Miller: Thank you. Good morning and thanks for this extended time for the conversation. I wanted to ask about your team in the store is. How are they feeling? If you think about reopening the dining room, how many of -- what would have been a prior concept in play? Were you able to retain or not retain, but actually bring back. And is that something that you're leveraging in terms of the reopening process?\nGene Lee: Yes, absolutely. That's what we think the investment that we made with the emergency pay and then paying their benefits has really paid off. We've had very little problem bringing our people back to work. They're excited to come back to work. They miss their work family. And so depending on the brand we're anywhere between 50% and 70% of the initial workforce coming back. In the restaurant business, our reputation is one of the most important things that we have. And so, we have great basic hygiene processes and procedures already developed. And so our team members are used to working in this environment. Now we're enforcing some social distancing. They have to wear a mask. But they're great already at washing their hands. The restaurants are already clean. They've got great food handling procedures. And so, there's a lot of confidence in our restaurants that these are great environments to work in and they feel safe. Our people are just so excited to get back to work. And even -- I would even say, even when we were in our off-premise only, the amount of people that were coming back to work and doing different types of jobs and just looking to contribute anyway was incredible. And so that's why one of the things that we talked about was the leadership team. The first thing that we're going to do is we're going to try to take care of our team members the best we possibly could in this very, very difficult situation. And that's why we've invested in a gross level $75 million an additional pay for those first three weeks. And I think we're being paid back for that not just today but I believe we'll be paid back for that in two, three, four, five years. Our restaurant managers are incredibly loyal. We treated them very, very well during this process.\nNicole Miller: And just to confirm and closed the loop on that. If you think about being relatively back in the range of 70% of sales, the staffing levels are 50% to 70% as a match to the 70% of sales. Is that the way to think about that?\nRick Cardenas: That's how we think about it.\nNicole Miller: Okay. Alright. Thanks again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nAndy Barish: Hey guys. I'll ask one and then a quick follow-up. Just Gene, can you give us sort of an update progress report on how Cheddar's has come through this. I know you were making some good strides on the people side. Obviously, this was unprecedented. But just an overview on where Cheddar's is heading?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think Cheddar's has made it through this very well. There's two things I would highlight on Cheddar's. First of all they've always under-indexed on off-premise. And we were able to do a couple of things through this a lot quicker than we were planning to do. First of all, we only had two antiquated phone lines going into each restaurant. And through this we were able to get them an upgraded phone systems, so people could actually call in orders and get a response from our team members. Second, we were able to transition them to online ordering. And we just had a big impact. And so their off-premise business has built and continues to build each and every week through this process, which we think will be very beneficial. The most important thing that happen for Cheddar's through all this is the way that we at Darden treated them. And I think that when you think about the management and employees, especially management this was a critical. I always look at when we do acquisitions, there's always this critical moment. When the management forgets about the old days. And they don't have that romance with it. And then they're thankful for the new days. And through this process, this is the time I think that our Cheddar's leadership and people in our restaurant. So just thankful that they were a big part of a big company that could step up and do the right thing. And I think that is going to create incredible loyalty. We've lost very few management people through this time. And people are really excited about what they're doing. And lastly, they have the opportunity and through this they made the biggest change with their menu and processes and procedures in the back of the house. That's going to have a long lasting impact on that business and improve the overall financial performance. So we're pleased. We think leadership did a great job. We think management and the restaurants did a great job. The team members came back excited. So we think this was a positive for Cheddar's when it's all set and done.\nAndy Barish: Great. And just a quick follow-up on the on the efficiency and the back of the house in lower prep hours. Was that simply the menu changes or did you also -- where were you also able to layer in some supply chain changes with more value added product or something like that?\nRick Cardenas: No. I think it was a little bit of value add, but not much. I think it was really -- there was just a -- there was a handful of products that weren't providing a whole lot of value to the consumer that caused a lot of chaos and a lot of additional prep and cost in the kitchen that we just removed from the menu. And our guests haven't been asking for it back. So I mean, there's just a lot of streamlining. But that menu has come down to a lot simpler. And they did some really good procedural work from the back door to the front -- to the dining room table that has just made it easy to execute.\nAndy Barish: Thanks, Ricks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to circle back on the comment you made about some of the investments you're considering making going forward. I just wanted to better understand the decision making process there. Is there something specific that you're looking for? Is it just a matter of timing? Just curious for any color on that please?\nGene Lee: You talking about the investments in the facilities that create capacity?\nAndrew Strelzik: There was a comment about kind of margins two or three years from now and not wanting to commit to something around that. So I guess, I'm just curious around those potential investments that you're considering?\nRick Cardenas: Andrew, this is Rick. Yes, I made the comment on margins. And there are a lot of investments we can make. One of them is to bring marketing back. And so we took -- we're taking marketing down significantly. Now, we'll still have some number in our P&L in Q1 for marketing as percent of sales. So, I would encourage none of you to put zero in there. We do have some marketing, but we significantly reduced it. These menu simplifications that we made. Are there some items that we need to bring back as we do some more research down the road when we have full dining rooms? Do we have enough breadth of appeal? And so, if we bring them back how do we do those. How do we bring those back with a simplified process. But it would still be a small investment. So there are other investments that we can make. We can make investments in taking less pricing, because we have margin to do that. We can make investments in quality which we're doing right now. LongHorn has just made some more significant quality investments in their menu even throughout this process. I don't know if it's in the restaurant yet, but its coming. It\u2019s a higher ounce weight for one of their best products without really pricing for it significantly. Olive Garden is making some significant investments right now in their menu in terms of a better quality and better value. And so, we still have a lot of investments that we can make. We're not going to talk necessarily about what we're going to look forward -- whether we make those investments or not. But just be sure to know that the margin that we have today gives us room to make investments or gives us room to drive into the bottom line.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks for making time for the questions. And Dave, congratulations on your retirement. Just a few follow-ups for me. First, kind of going zeroing in on this specifically. What percent of in-store sales can Olive Garden regain with the six foot capacity constraints still in place?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Jon, this is Rick. That's actually a difficult question to answer, because every restaurant is different in their layout. Not every restaurant, but a lot of restaurants are different in their layout. And we actually showed in our presentation what they're doing today. So what the restaurants are doing that are open. What are they doing in total sales and To Go sales and kind of get an idea of where they are. We think we can make that a little bit better overtime with some of these barriers that we're looking at. But any one brand is different. It's kind of hard to tell you exactly what percent we can do. It all also depends on how much people are willing to go on the shoulders of a meal period. And so, as the capacity constraints happen are people willing to wait a little bit longer or come in a little bit earlier and that'll help us drive more sales. But I couldn't tell you exactly what percent is the right number.\nJon Tower: Okay. Thanks. And then just on the labor savings so far. How much of 150 basis points you saw this quarter? Do you think can stick when volumes kind of return back to normal. And then just lastly. I don't think anybody asked yet and maybe I missed it. But you guys raised quite a bit of capital there in the quarter. Can you just discuss your intent on use of those proceeds? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Jon, as regards to the 150 basis points how much can stick as sales go up. All of -- our hourly labor is primarily variable. So unless we're making some significant changes to our menu or where we have to bring in some training again because there's a little bit less training in the fourth quarter. That would be the reason that our labor as a percent would go up. Or if we determine as we look at our guests experience, did we take a little bit too much out. And so, we don't believe that was the case because a lot of this labor came out of the kitchen. But we'll look at and see that and determine whether we need to bring some of it back. But I would still say that the first quarter should have an hourly labor benefit. Now remember, it's going to be offset by deleverage in the management labor side. And so, if you can remind me the second question, sorry.\nJon Tower: Just in terms of the proceeds you raised.\nRick Cardenas: On the capital front, yes, when we raised that additional $500 million in capital, we said it was to invest in growth and to shore up our balance sheet. And so, we believe our balance sheet is shored up as we mentioned our adjusted debt to adjusted capital ratio of 61% and our covenant is 75%. Had we not raised that capital we would have been a lot closer to that covenant. We are making investments in growth. Right now, as I mentioned, some of the investments that we're making are investments in quality. We're using some of that capital to invest in quality. We use some of that capital to invest in our team. As Gene mentioned, so the things that we did that we think are going to benefit us in long term. We now have the capital to be able to start growth again And as we've said, we're going to start opening restaurants again. We think that others might not have as much of a balance sheet to be able to do that. And so, those are the investments we're talking about today. And we'll continue to look at other ways to invest that capital for future growth. We think there's tremendous opportunity to invest. And that's why we took out that extra equity.\nJon Tower: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nBrett Levy: Great. Thanks for taking the call. And Dave, I think you really misunderstood what Gene was saying when he said that this is going to be a work at home, a stay at home economy. So congrats to your time off. When you think about the capital that you've provided us, the outlay for the $250 million to $300 million. How much of that is going to go in towards the new level of maintenance that these units are going to take? And also just how are you thinking about areas like the stepped-up IT and the digital onslaught that we're seeing? And then just when you think about your portfolio, you've talked about LongHorn, Olive Garden, Cheddar's a bit. Where do you still see additional need to work on at the other change to catch them up to where you are, and I'll stop there? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Okay, so you got Maintenance CapEx technology and brand mix. So if you think about our maintenance CapEx you know our number of 250 to 300 is probably got $100 million to $125 million, $100 million to $120 million of maintenance, which is a little bit lower than we normally say about 120 million, so let's just say we take a $20 million number out of that. On the technology front, we're still investing in technology. That's one of the things that we're going to continue to invest in, and we -- and we made a lot of investments in the fourth quarter. When you think about what we did to bring Cheddar's online, bring all the other brands that didn't have online ordering up to make some investments now on our curbside and how do we make that curbside even more streamlined through technology. How do we improve payment, and doing other things? So there's a lot more we're going to do in technology, that team\u2019s really really busy. We're really, really proud of what they did over the last couple of a couple of weeks of the actual 14 weeks to ensure that our website stayed up in running as we drove a lot more traffic. I mean, as it turns to the brand that we're investing in a week, we believe that we should invest in all of our brands. As we mentioned in the number of the openings, we're going to open I believe at least one restaurant for every brand. If we can get through all of the, all of the space limitations and the social distancing limitations in that 35 to 40 restaurants, and we are we are very excited about every one of our brands and their ability to grow.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning and Dave congratulations on your career. Obviously a huge work done in the past on Olive Garden. Two questions; first on seating capacity. You talked about how social distancing is more of a constraint. It sounds like it was more of a constraint for Olive Garden than LongHorn. I don't know if you meant to imply that, and if that is the case, how much of a booster capacity can occur with those barriers? And I have a follow up.\nGene Lee: Well the barriers that we're testing in Olive Garden can boost capacity significantly because the booth backs are so low in an Olive Garden, and that\u2019s the difference between Olive Garden and LongHorn is that the booth backs are much higher. And you think about a LongHorn, LongHorn is just one big room. What we do in a LongHorn is we use dividers to create space and to create the ambiance that we want, which ended up working in our favor that created some social distancing. Whereas, in Olive Garden, everything is at a much lower level, it's like at four feet. So we're looking at how do we, how do we you know we have gone in the majority of the Olive Gardens already and put plexiglass in certain places to create some barriers, to get us to the occupancy that we're at. And then also in Olive Garden, you have a lot of nooks and crannies, where we have you know four tables in there. And now we're lucky if we can, only know only going to use two, and if we can, in some of those instances in those rooms you only really get to use one. And so it's just, it just had to do more with what you know how the floor plan was. And our ability to harm, create barriers with Booth backs.\nDavid Palmer: I mean, is this -- is that 7% percent difference in the recent open stores roughly the difference? I mean how much of a boost to know you could you get?\nGene Lee: There's some decent [Ph] geography that's favoring LongHorn versus Olive Garden. A lot of Olive Garden\u2019s you know I mean -- just the way the way it's laid out. When you think about Georgia and the percentage of restaurants that LongHorn has in Georgia, and there are no restrictions in Georgia right now for the most part, they've really benefited from that.\nDavid Palmer: And I -- and I guess you mentioned there is positive comps in 10% to 15% of restaurants. I mean, we're talking about these capacity constraints. It's hard to get your head around how that's possible. Can -- you have any comment on that and how what sort of information that gives you about what's possible for the rest of your restaurants?\nGene Lee: Well it's just -- it's just you know you've got to -- you've got a significant off-premise business in those restaurants. And you have a consumer that probably has limited access to other restaurants that is willing to eat at two o'clock in the afternoon. And that's why I look at those restaurants. Some of them are more rural, especially in Georgia. And so you know I think each individual situation has got a specific reason why I think that that individual restaurant is performing the way it does. But it just says that you know combined with good off-premise consumer -- a consumer base that is willing to roll through the whole day and use the facility you can you can create some volume greater than last year -- situations though David.\nDavid Palmer: Yes. I mean do you don't feel like sharing what percent capacity increase you can get from these barriers on Olive Garden. Is that something you have put your finger on?\nGene Lee: Maybe up as much as 20%. You're putting your pipe, get to put every booth in, and then maybe a little bit higher and put every booth in play. Right now every other booth is out.\nDavid Palmer: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivanka with JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. I know we've kind of touched on unit development a couple of times, you know just looking for maybe some clarification and also maybe a little bit of forward guidance. 35 to 40 net, how many is that gross? In other words you know how many are you expecting to actually close in 2021 and obviously I did see some impairments and you're wondering if that was going to lead to some closures. And that CapEx number of 250 to 300 is a low number given the number of units that you are opening and certainly any CapEx that you have in 2021 would also kind of foretell whatever you're going to open in 2022, so are you kind of thinking that you can get back to a 2% to 3% unit development in fiscal 2022 and how should we think about -- it's a lot of different questions here. How should we think about overall maintenance CapEx as perhaps a percentage of DNA in a post crisis environment as you've kind of rethought the overall business models? And I'd like another question as well.\nRick Cardenas: All right, John. So the 35 to 40 restaurant is really almost gross and net. So there, we don't have a whole lot of closings that we would anticipate in this fiscal year. We just closed eleven restaurants in the fourth quarter. Some of them were already impaired and the rest of them we impaired when we closed them. And so if we had something that we were going to close, we already did it, unless we had something where the lease wouldn't allow us to close. So we don't anticipate closing any more restaurants this year unless there's a lease expiration that we couldn't move or if something gets damaged in other ways. So the gross to net is about the same. In terms of CapEx, the 250 to 300, remember we had stopped construction of 17 restaurants that were supposed to open in Q4 or in the fourth quarter really of FY 2020. And so a lot of that CapEx has already been spent. Even if we ramp up development, we wouldn't be able to ramp it up enough to spend a lot of CapEx in the late FY 2021 for FY 2022. We're not ready to talk about FY 2022 openings. So if you take out the 17 openings that we had delayed from FY 2020 to FY 2021 that cuts to 35.5. Right. And it cuts the 40 down to 23. And so we do believe, we could get to the 2% to 3% unit growth, get back to that fairly quickly. We'll probably be close to that this year when you think about the 35 to 40. The question will be 22 and how fast do we ramp up development when we have to make sure that the landlords and the landowners and the construction folks understand there's probably a new price out there today. And so that takes a little bit of time for price discovery. And so we'll see how long it takes us to ramp back up. We have the team to be able to do it, and we're ready to do it when we need it. On the maintenance side I think, I mentioned $100 million to $120 million. It's not too different than what we've been doing before. Remember, our number one priority with Capital is to make sure our restaurants are maintained beautifully. And we've been consistent in that all along. And so, we do not want to cut down on maintenance that is essential than it is needed, and we believe, maintaining our restaurants is essential maintenance. So while we did reduce that during the fourth quarter because basically restaurants weren't very busy, we will bring that back. And that's why we've got 100 million to 120 million in our CapEx number for this year.\nJohn Ivankoe: Okay. And maybe thinking about maintenance CapEx as a percentage of DNA, maybe that's kind of something to think about over the very long term and it doesn't necessarily have to play out over a couple of years I suppose is what you\u2019re telling me.\nGene Lee: Yes, it won't play out much.\nJohn Ivankoe: Okay, understood. And the second tier topic and it's kind of a completely different one, but it's a big spending bucket. A lot of companies are you kind of thinking about and re-evaluating their calendar 2021 versus calendar 2019 G&A. I mean, we're all kind of recognizing how different we can work in efficiency and how much travel we actually need to do, and how much money and time virtual work and work at home what have you actually saves us. And that's you know that's something separate even in head count. But how many of the changes you know in terms of the organization are you making whether it's spending per employee, not in salary, but on things on top of salary and also a number of employees. Are we beginning to think might be the right level for the organization and if it's possible that you know because it's such an important number to put in the model and this thing and to think about what that calendar 2021 versus calendar 2019 if it's fair to think about it in that way could look like for Darden?\nGene Lee: John, it's hard to answer calendar for us, because we're a fiscal year company. We don't think calendar. So to think that way would take a little bit of mental math.\nJohn Ivankoe: Yes, I understand. But it's like I just want to put an asterisk on calendar 2020. I bet you're unusual now you're right in the middle of it. So no. Okay, but\u2026\nGene Lee: And just let me give you an idea. We would anticipate in the first half of our fiscal year to have significantly less spend per employee in travel and in some of the department expenses that we have. We're also looking at our organization to see what the right size the organization is based on -- based on our sales levels today. And so as we mentioned after in Q4 we save $17 million in G&A. We don't anticipate to save $17 million in Q1, but we're going to save some G&A in Q1 and continue into Q2, without talking about what the percent G&A percent is. It's not going to be hugely hugely different than what it was at the end of the fiscal year -- in fiscal 20. So I wouldn't model dramatic changes. It could be 50 basis point to 100 basis points different, but higher, just because of those sales deleverage. But that's all in our guidance, that's all what we have in Q1, and as we get better understanding of what our sales levels are going to be going forward, we'll have a better understanding of what our G&A as a percent will be, but we will spend less per person on the on the department stuff and the travel in the first half of this fiscal year.\nJohn Ivankoe: Very helpful. Thanks for the patience and time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nMatthew DiFrisco: Thank you so much. I have two quick questions. One for Gene, in particular you guys have talked a lot about the bigger your scale being an advantage, and the consolidation at the top. So, some smaller independents, small original players potentially falling out, some capacity coming out. I wonder if you could update us on sort of your outlook say the next six months or so what we should look at as year-over-year capacity that potentially could come out of a full service casual dining sector. And then secondly for Rick, I wanted to sort of walk through that model where you gave about 30% down on sales equates to a little over 600 million in sales in your model in 1Q and then your EBITDA is about 200 million or so less. I wonder how do we get back to a whole basis year-over-year on EBITDA. Do we need all of the 600 million or so of sales to come back? Or could we get a portion of that to get greater than 200 million of EBITDA back. I'm trying to understand the flow through on this new lower variable cost model? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Okay, Matt. On capacity, I think, I'm not going to probably sit here today and predict a number whether that's 10%, 20%. There are a lot of people throwing around different numbers out there. The one thing I will say, I believe there will be significantly less restaurants out there to compete against in the near term. And the longer this environment last, I think the more fallout you're going to have. And so I think that that is an advantage for us going forward.\nRick Cardenas: Matt, and as it relates to sales to get back to our EBITDA, yes you're right. It's about 600 million is what you mentioned on the 30%. We don't need all 600 million to get back to that EBITDA based on what our margin structure looks like today. You know I'm not going to give you exactly what we need, but it it's not 100% of what we were doing before. That said, the reason I'm not going to give you that number is because we may invest some of that stuff. Some of that back. So I don't want, I don't want to add a number to say it's 90%, 95% or 100% because we're going to do the right thing for our guests and our team members to make sure that this cost structure that we have today is the right cost structure in the future. And if it's not we'll make some investments. But I will say that those investments may take a little bit of time. So we will have a better flow through in the first quarter on some of these sales than we would have had in the past.\nMatthew DiFrisco: Excellent. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Catherine Fogarty with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nKatherine Fogertey: Great. Thank you for the question. I have a couple of questions mainly around the menu for simplification that you may have said you went through during the quarter. And I was hoping you could kind of walk through bright brands and where you found the greatest amount of efficiency. And you mentioned some are about 15% to 20% below prior menu points. What would be the catalyst to bring them back, and any kind of numbers you could put around the cost savings you found on that side? And I have a follow up.\nRick Cardenas: Okay. This is Rick. On a brand by brand level to tell you what the margin differences are, and what we've done that's it could be pretty, pretty long conversation. But I would say that as Gene mentioned earlier, Cheddar\u2019s made a lot of change to their menu, and a lot of change in their procedures to bring a lot of direct labor out of the system. So if you think about kind of an order of magnitude Cheddar\u2019s had the most change in their menu and the improvement in their labor cost over time. All of our brands are doing better in direct labor as a percent of sales than they were last year. All of them, Cheddar\u2019s is doing a lot better. But to tell you exactly what we did, again, all brands did things differently, all brands change their menus a little bit differently. But all brands focused on and we went into it optimists only model. They focused on how can we serve? What can we serve? What are our highest value items? What are highest guest satisfaction items, and what are the items that we can actually run it with just managers. And so if you think about brands, like Cheddar\u2019s, like Capital Grille, the smaller you know the specialty brands most of their To Go sales when they were To Go only were done with managers only. So we had to simplify that menu. And Olive Garden also simplified even though they had team members in the restaurant at the same time. But those simplifications again were to streamline the menu to the most value item, value items for the guest and the ones that the guest wanted the most. And so what's interesting now, and without the menu marketing and the different things that we do on a menu development, you know guests are voting with what they're buying. And it's amazing what as we simplified the menu we can actually see what the guest\u2019s favorites really are. And the great thing is, for a brand like Olive Garden, it's a few products that are on a few different menu items and so it actually is better to keep it that way because we streamline. And so without giving you specific examples, those are some kind of high levels of how we did it. And again, all brand had hourly labor efficiency improvements and we expect those to stay maybe not as good as they were, but we expect the efficiencies to stay.\nKatherine Fogertey: [Indiscernible] helpful ranking on that guys. And then my follow up question is actually around the comments you made about investing for growth. Am I right to be thinking that M&A is at potential opportunity just given you have some of the benefit of your balance sheet and if that is right, what categories look particularly attracted to you? What do you think would help with your overall [Indiscernible] or do you have any holes in your portfolio that you are particularly excited about going forward?\nGene Lee: But you know what the management and the board will continue to look at the opportunities that are available out there; we'll look at our own portfolio. We look at what, it's out there that could possibly fit our portfolio. The only thing I would say on specifics around that is that we believe we want to be in the full service business, that's where we get the advantages of our scale. So as we look out there at the full service environment, I think that we'll continue to analyze the opportunities and if something makes sense, then we'll try to bring an end to our platform. Our thought process is always does it benefits by coming on our platform, and does the platform benefit it by them coming on the platform to get through that screen and they can grow a little bit. Then it makes sense. I think right now it's about timing. It's about what's the right, what the price. You know the price discovery. And then we'd have to make the decision at that point in time.\nKatherine Fogertey: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And it looks like that's all the questions that we have at this time I'd like to turn the call back over to our presenters.\nGene Lee: Thank you, James. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind everyone that we plan to release first quarter results on Thursday September 24th before the market opens. Thank you for participating in today's call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gene Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. It has been 14 weeks since our last earnings call. I don't know about all of you, but it's felt more like 14 months, so much has happened. Over the past three months, our business changed in ways we never imagined, so I want to spend my time with you this morning trying to put it all in perspective for you, then Rick will share some of our fourth quarter and year-end results and provide our outlook for the first quarter. When I look back on all that has transpired, one thing that stands out is the resiliency of the full service dining industry. Prior to the pandemic, total annual sales for the casual dining industry was approximately $108 billion. And while I do not know how long it will take the industry to recover from the significant impact it experienced, I am confident that this category will get back to the size it once was. Our industry plays a vital role in our communities, and that was evident in how the consumer relied on restaurants over the last several months, even in a to-go-only environment. And while off-premise will continue to play an important role as we recover, we know that the consumer still wants to enjoy an in-restaurant experience. In fact, going out to a restaurant with friends and family is the number one activity consumers say they look forward to doing as the economy opens back up, and we've seen that as our dine-ins reopen across the country. As this vital industry continues to rebuild, there is tremendous opportunity to increase market share through increased on-premise demand and incremental off-premise sales. Those executing at the highest level are going to continue to win, and Darden is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity. When we last spoke in March, we knew the pandemic was going to have a significant impact on our business. Our ability to manage through this crisis has been driven by our commitment to prioritize guest and team member safety, invest in our team members, provide frequent and transparent communication, leverage our digital platform, and be brilliant with the basics. The health and safety of our guests and team members has always been our top priority, and we've taken a number of steps to create a safe environment in our restaurants. From sourcing masks and other personal protective equipment for our team members to developing a contactless curbside pickup process at our brands while our dine-ins were closed. We are mindful of the trust our guests and team members place in us. Today, our health and safety commitments are focused on team member health checks, personal protective equipment, enhanced sanitation processes, social distancing, and frequent hand washing. We also provide paid sick leave for all our team members so they can stay home if they're ill. But we can't do it alone, and that is why we encourage our guests to join the online waitlist or make reservations, not enter our restaurants if they are symptomatic, wear a mask, and utilize contactless or mobile payment options where available. We continued to invest in our team members as our dine-ins closed. In addition to rolling out permanent paid sick leave, we introduced a three week emergency pay program that provided nearly $75 million of pay during the fourth quarter for our hourly team members who could not work. When emergency pay ended, we covered insurance payments and benefit deductions for hourly team members who were furloughed. As we brought hourly team members back to work to support increased to-go volume, we introduced an additional payment to help cover unexpected costs such as transportation and child care incurred as a result of the pandemic. And to recognize the unbelievable work our managers did during the quarter, we paid their target bonus for the fourth quarter. We know our people are our greatest competitive advantage. Not only were these investments the right thing to do to take care of our team members, they've also created a deeper loyalty and strengthened engagement while we've seen this pay-off as we bring our people back to work. Communication is the most important aspect of leadership during a crisis. We knew frequent and transparent communication with our team members and investors was important. Beyond daily meetings with all of our brand presidents who in turn met with their operational leaders on a daily basis, we have maintained a consistent communication cadence with our team members. Since this crisis began, I have provided regular business updates to our people and have been open and honest about the impacts to our business, and consequently the impacts to them. We took the same approach with our shareholders and the analysts by providing four business updates during the quarter. The pandemic accelerated the consumer's desire for convenience, and we saw a significant increase in digital engagement. The work we have done over the past few years investing in our digital platform to reduce friction prepared us to quickly adapt to consumer behavior and deliver on their expectations of convenience in our to-go-only environment. During this time, we have strengthened our digital platform and made meaningful progress against our digital strategy. In addition to improving the guest experience across our digital channels, our strategy is focused on using technology to help our guests easily order outside and inside the restaurant, improve the wait to be seated, streamline the order pickup process, and speed up how they pay. We've been building on our digital platform to support increased demand, and we certainly tested it like never before. During the quarter, online ordering at Olive Garden grew by more than 300% over the prior year and accounted for 58% of To Go sales. And at LongHorn, online ordering grew by 400% and accounted for 49% of To Go sales. Additionally, we accelerated our timeline and rolled out online ordering at our brands that had not yet deployed it. We also added the ability to order alcohol online for all of our brands and markets where that was allowed. Our commitment to being brilliant with the basics allowed us to remain focused on operational execution even as the environment forced us to radically change how we serve our guests. Each one of our brands did a phenomenal job delivering a new guest experience by collaborating and sharing best practices. This involved creating contact -- contactless curbside pickup that included designing what was essentially a drive-thru in our parking lots while this execution in this environment meant enabling our guests to order and pay online and have our team members seamlessly place their sealed orders in their vehicles. Our operators displayed tremendous innovation, flexibility, and passion as they continue to serve our guests. And to ensure we consistently executed at the highest level, we took the opportunity to streamline our menus, and improve our processes and procedures. With these changes, we are seeing improvements in execution and direct labor productivity. So what have we learned from all this? We've learned a lot. But most importantly, this situation has reinforced that our strategy that we developed five years ago grounded in our back-to-basics operating philosophy leveraging our four competitive advantages and cultivating a portfolio of iconic brands is still the right one today. Strong brands with loyal guests have fared better, and the trust we have earned from our guests is critical. Being brilliant with the basics by consistently delivering exceptional food, service, and atmosphere is imperative. However, we know how important safety including this are to our guests right now, and we must continue to earn their trust every day. And throughout this unprecedented time we have been benefited greatly from our four competitive advantages. Our significant scale, our extensive data and insights, our regular strategic planning and our culture; whether sourcing PPE for our team members, ensuring we're not impacted by supply chain issues or sharing best practices across eight brands, the ability to leverage just scale has allowed us to quickly react to constant change. Finally, as I said earlier, we know our people are our greatest competitor advantage. And I'm impressed by how our team members responded and continue to respond to take care of our guests and each other. Having a strong culture has been part of our DNA since we were founded. We were able to keep the majority of our managers employed and we stayed connected with our furloughed hourly team members. This allowed us to bring our people back quickly and get our dinings opened safely without any delays. As you saw in our press release, 91% of our dinings have reopened with at least limited capacity. We have also brought 60,000 furloughed restaurant team members back-to-work and we expect to bring at least another 40,000 back as business continues to improve. I'm incredibly proud that our culture is actually strengthened during this most difficult period in our company's history. This, above all else is what gives me confidence in Darden's future. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. Thanks, Rick. And as you've seen in our 8-K filing this morning, Dave George will be retiring on August 2nd. Dave will celebrate his 65th birthday later this year, and we've been discussing this transition for some time. Dave and I have been partners on this journey for 23 years. It was a joint venture partner for LongHorn when I joined RARE in 1997. I still remember the first time I met him. We're going to visit his restaurant, so he picked me up at the airport in his Volvo, with no air conditioning in the North Carolina heat. I knew at the end of the day that Dave was a special operator. I wasted no time we bought out his interest in his joint venture and brought him into the company. Over the last 23 years Dave has been a successful in every one of his leadership positions. He has led three of Darden's iconic brands; the Capital Grille LongHorn Steakhouse and Olive Garden, and most recently he served as our Chief Operating Officer. He built great teams and became a mentor to many operators and executives. His can do approach and attitude permeates throughout Darden in each of our brands today. For many of the last 23 years, Dave and I have had lunch together on Monday to discuss what happened the previous week and talk about what needed to get done going forward. Not much has changed over those 23 years except today; we order salads instead of two or three entries each. And for the last five years, David sat next to me during every hour earnings call as he is today helped me find the details I need to answer your questions. I'll miss seeing him when I walk into the room on these days. For all the Darden team members listening today, our annual conference which usually happens in August would have been a great opportunity for everyone to see Dave, thank him and wish him well in person. Unfortunately, because of COVID-19, our conference has been postponed until next year. We will however be inviting Dave to our conference in 2021, and he's committed to come so we can celebrate all he's done for Darden and for many of you. In closing, I want to say thank you to all our team members, those currently working and those who remain on furlough. And as I've said to you repeatedly, your ability to adapt, innovate and collaborate during this time has truly been inspiring. Thank you for your on-going commitment to our guests and each other. And now we'll open up it up for questions. I lost you \u2013 did I lose you just -- you there, David. I lost you. Last word I heard was on the other side. Is there a period after that or --? Yes. Good morning, David. Yes, I think that as I said in my prepared remarks. We went into this as a $108 billion category, and I've been really impressed with the resiliency of the consumer and how important full service casual dining has been in everyday life of our guests. So, I think the industry gets back to where it was. I think it's important. I think people really miss it, probably miss it more than they know. There's been a lot of predictions of how much capacity will come out of the system. I'm not going to sit here today and say I know what the exact number is. The one thing I do believe is there'll be -- there'll be less competition as we -- and less restaurants as we move forward, and I think that's a great opportunity for us. I think scale is going to matter more than ever. I think that you know we believe that we can get back to 2% to 3% unit growth pretty quickly. We're going to continue to open restaurants. We're going to continue to do new deals. We think the economics going forward here in the short term should get better for us on new restaurant development, and I think we'll go back to our basics. We're going to continue to try to improve our food offerings. We're going to try to make sure we have the right value that we're offering the consumer. As we mentioned in both our comments this morning, we've improved productivity in our restaurants through more streamlined menus. So, we think the opportunity is there. We also think that off-premise will play a bigger role as we move forward. We think our capabilities in that have improved dramatically over the last 14 weeks, and we -- and I think a lot of consumers have had the opportunity to maybe use our service off-premise that hadn't used it before. I think they were really pleased with the overall experience. Yes. I think -- I think David, each brand's in a different place. Each brand went to a different place when they went off premise only, so some brands I would say right now are probably back to 100% of where they will want to be other than maybe some promotional items here and there. Other brands still have 10%, 15% that they need to add back to their menus to make them competitive. But it was not only the menu. I mean, I think when we basically closed down the operation except for off-premise, we had the chance to rebuild as we opened back up and we had a chance to look at all our processes and procedures, and I think we were able to simplify and eliminate a lot of prep work in some of our businesses that we'll never get back into the business. I think these are costs that we're going to -- we've gotten out. We've had a lot of discussion around our table is that it's been much easier as we build the on-premise business back up to reimagine what the operation in the back of house looks like versus trying to reimagine it why you're operating. And we're really thrilled with the results so far. We've run a lot of tests there, David. I think where we're settling in right now is $50 minimum, it's still the 5 o'clock call the day -- the day before. We find that to be the sweet spot. The average order size is still well above that. We didn't see any benefit of going below that threshold. And so, that's where we're going \u2013 that's what we're netting out and we think that, that opportunity will continue to be there. I won't -- we will tell you that we did test doing our own delivery, found it really inefficient, and it wasn't that additive. And so, we're really focused on this curbside operation and think that's the future for off premise. Yes. You know Brian two things to consider. First of all, geography is working for LongHorn. We've got the state of Georgia. We have a huge presence there, and business has come back real strong. I would also say that the Olive Garden dining room yields a higher percentage of tables available in -- with the occupancy restrictions than Olive Garden does. And so I want to take this opportunity to talk just a little bit about occupancy. A lot of people have done a lot of work on this and I think that you're -- I think you need to think about just a little bit differently. Once your past 25% occupancy the only thing that matters is there is six feet of social distancing required. Remember, there's always significant inefficiencies in your seating capacity. We've always got twos and fours -- fours and sixes. We've got tables for large parties. Our average party side is two point three. So different layouts even in different -- inside the same brand will yield you different seating efficiencies. We will be installing temporary barriers in approximately 100 restaurants in the next two weeks to try to improve this efficiency especially in Olive Garden. We want to do that while maintaining the social distancing requirements. We'll analyze the sales growth after that we've installed those barriers and decide how many more restaurants we want to add it -- added to. So that's a long answer to your question, but I think that there's some confusion out there and we have to remember that once you're past 25% occupancy, that's six foot restriction on social distancing trumps any other restriction there is, because you can't get to 50%. Hey John, thanks for the question. As it relates to margins incrementally going forward, right now if you look at our P&L and the way our margins looked, our margins are better on a variable cost basis than they were coming into the pandemic. So if we don't make other investments going forward, you would anticipate our margins to be a little bit better than they were before. However, we're still making decisions on what we'll do as the sales continue to grow, whether we bring some things back or invest in our guest even more to grow sales even faster. So, I don't want to comment too much on what our margin structure is going to look like in a year or two years, because we may make choices that take away some of that margin gain that we had or we may let that margin flow to the bottom line. But as of right now, our variable margins are better than they were coming into the pandemic. John. We've had third-party delivery in some of our restaurants even before the pandemic started including some Olive Gardens, the lot of Yard House. And we actually added some third-party delivery in Yard House in a different state. And we really didn't see that the third-party delivery grew faster than our own To Go business. Our own To Go business actually grew faster than the third-party business in those restaurants. And so, we're still at the point where we believe that our off-premise business is really strong and continues to grow. And we are not anticipating, launching a third-party delivery model. Now, as we've said all the time that can change as soon as we see or if we see that those margins are equal to what we do today then maybe we'll go into the third-party model. But as of right now, our resolve is strong. We believe that doing off-premise the way we do it, especially now that we've added this significant curbside business is the way to go. As far as capacity for Olive Garden goes, I don't really think it has -- the party size has an impact on that. It just more the way the physical layout is. And we have a lot more room. We have rooms. We have less boost. And so, we're trying to create that six feet is more difficult. Remember, some of our smaller rooms are offset. They're family tables, they're larger parties. Olive Garden does a lot of that. But the majority of our buildings right now - because the booth backs are less than six feet. We can correct the same yield. If we - and we adhering to the local jurisdictions. If we adhere to those local jurisdictions we can't create the same percentage occupancy in mostly Olive Gardens that we can in LongHorn. And that's why putting some of these temporary barriers that we're building in there could help increase the yield. And what we're seeing. We're seeing - I think, when we talk about Olive Garden, we need to focus on the absolute sales number, which is significant. And as we get towards the weekend our percentages come down a little - I mean, get a little bit tougher to keep up, right? So the bigger, bigger days that we have an Olive Garden are harder to match. Early in the week, our year-over-year sales declines are little bit less. As far as off-premise, I think that -- we believe off-premise will play a bigger role going forward. I'm not so sure that we expect to kind of keep these run rate once we get back to a normal environment as long as there's a threat of COVID and people have modified their personal behaviors that we think off-premise business will continue to stay robust. We think this will be a contributor going forward. We think when we level out we'll be at higher percentages of off-premise in all of our businesses. While I can't sit here today and say what I think that percentage is going to be. I do think it will be greater. Yes. I would say, it's too early to say, its really changed our philosophy on new restaurant development at this point. But one thing I do believe is the economics are going to be more favorable than they were pre-COVID. I think that they'll be a lot less people growing out there. So I think the cost of construction should come down just like it did in '09, '10, and '11. I think the cost of the underlying land should come down significantly. And so, as we look forward I think the economics look promising. The best restaurant deals we did were after the recession in '09 and '10 especially for our specialty brands. So we'll push hard on that to get favorable economics where it possible. I do think that as we look at these businesses transition to more curbside than folks coming into a restaurant that picking up the take-out order. And we still don't know how we get back to a normal environment. How that's going to migrate back. Will this going to stay 100% curbside or people are going to want to come in. We've got to really go to that discovery process. I think the big work that needs to be done is to think about what do we need to do inside the box to better support and stage curbside, if its going to be that big part of our business. Up until recently in our existing restaurant we been doing remodels to create capacity for inside pickup. Now we got a really re-look at that as we go forward. We have been developing an Olive Garden more of a dedicated pickup space off the side of the kitchen that we are really happy with. But that might not be the way we want to go going forward. We don't know. And so, we'll see as we move forward. I think we'll try to build a little more flexibility in our dining rooms and think about different barriers and our floor plans. So that if something like this happened in the future we might have more flexibility. But I'm actually -- I'm really excited about the opportunity to build restaurants. I'm confident in our model. I believe the cost -- the initial investment cost is going to be less or at least not be inflating at the rate it was inflating. So we're going to be able to create significant value for Darden going forward with new restaurant growth and we'll probably be one of the few out there that's opening new restaurants. On the first question, I think -- I mean, LongHorn just started at a much lower level for off-premise and that's why it's growing at three times and not two times. I don't think there's anything more to that. I think the absolute dollars going outside on Olive Garden. Our on-take out are impressive. I mean, they have some of the CD levels of overall sales. I mean, those are impressive numbers. If you look at 40% last week on $81,000 per week. I mean, that's a huge business. So, I wouldn't read anything else into that other than LongHorn started at a much lower level. As far as promotional go --promotions go, we've pulled back. Obviously, we've pulled back on almost all promotional activity. You're seeing us do a little bit of television Olive Garden because we own the spots. We bought them in the upfront. And so we need to -- we'll continue to advertise there. Right now, we don't think it's prudent to be promoting people into our restaurants when we have long waits to get into the dining rooms. Well, I think we would just be creating more frustration for our guests who can't get in. And so, at some point maybe we'll do some more off-premise advertising. But right now, we're looking -- we're taking this opportunity to cleanse our marketing spend to understand as we put it back in what works better. What gets us the highest return on investment as we as we put it back into the system? And when that's going to be a big opportunity, again, this is where scale will matter. We can come back in and advertise our businesses at the right time. We don't think this is the right time to be advertising. We think this is the right time to pull it back, analyze the situation and we'll make it -- whenever its doing this -- when the situation is right, then we'll start to layer some advertising back in and promotion back in. Well, I think that -- I'll answer the first question -- last question first. The off-premises is strong. It's maintaining. Wouldn't see no change in off-premise in those states for the most part. As far as how those states are performing against others and all depends I think on what your brand strength is and what your relative share is in those markets. So obviously, when you look at LongHorn in Atlanta Georgia, we've got the largest share of voice there. I mean, we have 45 restaurants in the DMA. We're very trusted brand. We are borne out of LongHorn -- out of Atlanta. And so, I think people just trust the brand. And so, where we have great brand strength whether it's a Cheddar's market that has great brand strength. There an Olive Garden Market that has great brand strength. Those restaurants come back faster and perform at a higher level. And so, I don't think it really has to do with as much as when the state opened, as much as what's the brand strength in those specific markets. Another example is where we do really well in LongHorn Cincinnati is another one of those early markets. And we came back strong in Cincinnati as soon as we opened. But that's true in for Cheddar's in certain markets, is true for Olive Garden in certain markets. Well, the most permanent and the most significant thing we've done is streamline the menus and our processes and procedures and that's forever. This was the opportunity that a lot of us have been waiting for. When we closed down our dining rooms and we knew we had to simplify for the off-premise. And then we had those three or four weeks to really focus at the corporate level with our teams. They say, okay, what do we really need to come back. And how do we keep this simple. Because we had no idea what was going to happen when we opened our dining rooms. We didn't know when it was going to show up. And so we had these simple menus out there. They're all disposable. We knew that we could change them quickly if we needed to. But what we learned was, we could get enough variety on the menus to satisfy the demand of the consumer. And we could simplify it because we want to make sure we didn't have as much labor in the back of the house to execute it. So to me that's the biggest thing our teams have done. And that's been the biggest insight on that -- some of the --what I would call this superfluous menu items that are on our menu that one out of 100 people that were buying when they were coming in just aren't important. And most of those created the complexity in the kitchen. And so with this one -- hopefully once in a lifetime opportunity we were able to pull those out. And I think that's what's going to be the lasting change. It's going to have significant impact two, three, four years from today. I would just say real quickly. We've seen no change in our business trends in the states that are starting to spike. Obviously, we're concerned, we're focused on it. But as a leadership team, we always talk about, let's focus on what we can control, right? We can't control it. We're not doctors. We're not in the government. Folks are going to do what their leadership inside the states are going to do what they're going to do. What we -- if we're focused a pivot again to more restrictions in restaurant dining or even if we to go back all the way to an off-premise, we can pivot that way. It's going to be a lot easier this time to pivot that way, because we know we're going to do. We know how to do it. Last time we were kind of making it up as we were going. We made a lot of right decisions as we did that. But this time it would be a lot smoother for us to pivot back to on off-premise. Its only experienced for a short period of time. I think the difference this time is that this will be micro, not macro. And that's how we're thinking about it. And that we've got a team setup to manage day-to-day what's happening in these local municipalities. And we'll adjust. But as we think about it as a management and a leadership team is, we're going to control what we can control and we're not going to worry about things that we can't control. No. Peter, I mean, we're talking here six or seven days since we've really seen something. We haven't seen any change in any behavior at this point in time that we can call out. Who knows? Maybe some will change tomorrow. I don't know. But right now there's nothing for us to say that can add any value to this topic. Yes. I think it's real simple. Once we the capacity and if we see any let-up in demand, then we can pivot to value. We have that opportunity to invest in value to drive traffic. At this point it just doesn't make any sense, because we have no capacity to drive it to. And I think -- when you think about stimulus, I would say, it's definitely a positive. I'm not sure we can quantify how positive it is. And I would say that yes, right now there is -- we think it's -- some of that's going to go away at the end of July. But I have to -- you have to -- at least I think that the government's going to have to add some other stimulus to the economy that should be positive to us and it just may come to us to a different vehicle. And so, I expect the overall economy to have stimulus in it. I don't think it'll come in the same form as it's coming today. But I think that we'll get our fair share of it. Yes. I think what you're asking me is impossible to predict right now. Because what we -- we don't really understand the competitive situation. We don't understand how many competitors are going to be out there. We don't understand the stimulus that the government going to put it in. So I don't know where this levels out. But I do think it's important to note that our fine dining businesses and most of primary all our specialty businesses are going to return to normal more slowly than I think casual dining will return to normal. Primarily because Capital Grille, Eddie V's rely on business travel and entertainment as a big part of their sales. And we saw that in '09 and '10, the businesses do shift. You become more weekend-focused in fine dining and in an environment like this. And we're already seeing that shift that our weekends are actually fairly good in fine dining. Our Midweek business is weak. And so, I think to sum it up, the specialty brands are going to -- are going to come back a little bit lower especially in some of -- like some of the yard houses that are tied to ballparks or stadiums or something like L.A. Live, as those areas come -- those entertainment areas come back slower. They will have some tough sledding going forward there. But I don't know where this all ends up. All I do know is that with our strategy and we believe with our scale and our competitive advantages that we are positioned to gain market share as we move forward. And I'm confident in that. And I believe the investments we've made in our people are going to be the biggest advantage we have. Well, I think it's tough. I think that that's -- we're balancing how much do we want. How much capital we want to invest in some sort of temporary solution. If you asked me two weeks ago, I would have thought they were on a better path to being able to see all the restrictions lifted. Obviously that has changed here in the short term. So there's not -- I don't think there's much more that we can do than create some physical barriers without ruining the atmosphere in the restaurants to create capacity. I mean, some of our folks have been really creative with outside seating, which I applaud, and I hope they continue to do that. But then, as we get into the summer months down south, that gets more difficult because of the thunderstorms and things like that. So I really don't see. I think we have to learn to live with what the restrictions are until such time they're removed. Yes, absolutely. That's what we think the investment that we made with the emergency pay and then paying their benefits has really paid off. We've had very little problem bringing our people back to work. They're excited to come back to work. They miss their work family. And so depending on the brand we're anywhere between 50% and 70% of the initial workforce coming back. In the restaurant business, our reputation is one of the most important things that we have. And so, we have great basic hygiene processes and procedures already developed. And so our team members are used to working in this environment. Now we're enforcing some social distancing. They have to wear a mask. But they're great already at washing their hands. The restaurants are already clean. They've got great food handling procedures. And so, there's a lot of confidence in our restaurants that these are great environments to work in and they feel safe. Our people are just so excited to get back to work. And even -- I would even say, even when we were in our off-premise only, the amount of people that were coming back to work and doing different types of jobs and just looking to contribute anyway was incredible. And so that's why one of the things that we talked about was the leadership team. The first thing that we're going to do is we're going to try to take care of our team members the best we possibly could in this very, very difficult situation. And that's why we've invested in a gross level $75 million an additional pay for those first three weeks. And I think we're being paid back for that not just today but I believe we'll be paid back for that in two, three, four, five years. Our restaurant managers are incredibly loyal. We treated them very, very well during this process. Yes. I think Cheddar's has made it through this very well. There's two things I would highlight on Cheddar's. First of all they've always under-indexed on off-premise. And we were able to do a couple of things through this a lot quicker than we were planning to do. First of all, we only had two antiquated phone lines going into each restaurant. And through this we were able to get them an upgraded phone systems, so people could actually call in orders and get a response from our team members. Second, we were able to transition them to online ordering. And we just had a big impact. And so their off-premise business has built and continues to build each and every week through this process, which we think will be very beneficial. The most important thing that happen for Cheddar's through all this is the way that we at Darden treated them. And I think that when you think about the management and employees, especially management this was a critical. I always look at when we do acquisitions, there's always this critical moment. When the management forgets about the old days. And they don't have that romance with it. And then they're thankful for the new days. And through this process, this is the time I think that our Cheddar's leadership and people in our restaurant. So just thankful that they were a big part of a big company that could step up and do the right thing. And I think that is going to create incredible loyalty. We've lost very few management people through this time. And people are really excited about what they're doing. And lastly, they have the opportunity and through this they made the biggest change with their menu and processes and procedures in the back of the house. That's going to have a long lasting impact on that business and improve the overall financial performance. So we're pleased. We think leadership did a great job. We think management and the restaurants did a great job. The team members came back excited. So we think this was a positive for Cheddar's when it's all set and done. You talking about the investments in the facilities that create capacity? Okay, so you got Maintenance CapEx technology and brand mix. So if you think about our maintenance CapEx you know our number of 250 to 300 is probably got $100 million to $125 million, $100 million to $120 million of maintenance, which is a little bit lower than we normally say about 120 million, so let's just say we take a $20 million number out of that. On the technology front, we're still investing in technology. That's one of the things that we're going to continue to invest in, and we -- and we made a lot of investments in the fourth quarter. When you think about what we did to bring Cheddar's online, bring all the other brands that didn't have online ordering up to make some investments now on our curbside and how do we make that curbside even more streamlined through technology. How do we improve payment, and doing other things? So there's a lot more we're going to do in technology, that team's really really busy. We're really, really proud of what they did over the last couple of a couple of weeks of the actual 14 weeks to ensure that our website stayed up in running as we drove a lot more traffic. I mean, as it turns to the brand that we're investing in a week, we believe that we should invest in all of our brands. As we mentioned in the number of the openings, we're going to open I believe at least one restaurant for every brand. If we can get through all of the, all of the space limitations and the social distancing limitations in that 35 to 40 restaurants, and we are we are very excited about every one of our brands and their ability to grow. Well the barriers that we're testing in Olive Garden can boost capacity significantly because the booth backs are so low in an Olive Garden, and that's the difference between Olive Garden and LongHorn is that the booth backs are much higher. And you think about a LongHorn, LongHorn is just one big room. What we do in a LongHorn is we use dividers to create space and to create the ambiance that we want, which ended up working in our favor that created some social distancing. Whereas, in Olive Garden, everything is at a much lower level, it's like at four feet. So we're looking at how do we, how do we you know we have gone in the majority of the Olive Gardens already and put plexiglass in certain places to create some barriers, to get us to the occupancy that we're at. And then also in Olive Garden, you have a lot of nooks and crannies, where we have you know four tables in there. And now we're lucky if we can, only know only going to use two, and if we can, in some of those instances in those rooms you only really get to use one. And so it's just, it just had to do more with what you know how the floor plan was. And our ability to harm, create barriers with Booth backs. There's some decent [Ph] geography that's favoring LongHorn versus Olive Garden. A lot of Olive Garden's you know I mean -- just the way the way it's laid out. When you think about Georgia and the percentage of restaurants that LongHorn has in Georgia, and there are no restrictions in Georgia right now for the most part, they've really benefited from that. Well it's just -- it's just you know you've got to -- you've got a significant off-premise business in those restaurants. And you have a consumer that probably has limited access to other restaurants that is willing to eat at two o'clock in the afternoon. And that's why I look at those restaurants. Some of them are more rural, especially in Georgia. And so you know I think each individual situation has got a specific reason why I think that that individual restaurant is performing the way it does. But it just says that you know combined with good off-premise consumer -- a consumer base that is willing to roll through the whole day and use the facility you can you can create some volume greater than last year -- situations though David. Maybe up as much as 20%. You're putting your pipe, get to put every booth in, and then maybe a little bit higher and put every booth in play. Right now every other booth is out. Yes, it won't play out much. John, it's hard to answer calendar for us, because we're a fiscal year company. We don't think calendar. So to think that way would take a little bit of mental math. And just let me give you an idea. We would anticipate in the first half of our fiscal year to have significantly less spend per employee in travel and in some of the department expenses that we have. We're also looking at our organization to see what the right size the organization is based on -- based on our sales levels today. And so as we mentioned after in Q4 we save $17 million in G&A. We don't anticipate to save $17 million in Q1, but we're going to save some G&A in Q1 and continue into Q2, without talking about what the percent G&A percent is. It's not going to be hugely hugely different than what it was at the end of the fiscal year -- in fiscal 20. So I wouldn't model dramatic changes. It could be 50 basis point to 100 basis points different, but higher, just because of those sales deleverage. But that's all in our guidance, that's all what we have in Q1, and as we get better understanding of what our sales levels are going to be going forward, we'll have a better understanding of what our G&A as a percent will be, but we will spend less per person on the on the department stuff and the travel in the first half of this fiscal year. Okay, Matt. On capacity, I think, I'm not going to probably sit here today and predict a number whether that's 10%, 20%. There are a lot of people throwing around different numbers out there. The one thing I will say, I believe there will be significantly less restaurants out there to compete against in the near term. And the longer this environment last, I think the more fallout you're going to have. And so I think that that is an advantage for us going forward. But you know what the management and the board will continue to look at the opportunities that are available out there; we'll look at our own portfolio. We look at what, it's out there that could possibly fit our portfolio. The only thing I would say on specifics around that is that we believe we want to be in the full service business, that's where we get the advantages of our scale. So as we look out there at the full service environment, I think that we'll continue to analyze the opportunities and if something makes sense, then we'll try to bring an end to our platform. Our thought process is always does it benefits by coming on our platform, and does the platform benefit it by them coming on the platform to get through that screen and they can grow a little bit. Then it makes sense. I think right now it's about timing. It's about what's the right, what the price. You know the price discovery. And then we'd have to make the decision at that point in time. Thank you, James. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind everyone that we plan to release first quarter results on Thursday September 24th before the market opens. Thank you for participating in today's call."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you Gene and good morning everyone. Fiscal 2020 was on track for a solid year of performance and the beginning of Q4 was no different. The first few weeks of sales were strong and then nearly overnight, the impact of COVID-19 required us to pivot to a To Go only format. This posed unprecedented challenges for our restaurant and support center teams and I am proud of how everyone moved quickly to increase To Go sales, reduce costs, manage working capital and improve efficiency. The simplifications Gene referenced helped to reduce key variable expenses in our restaurants especially direct labor. The teams also worked to reduce or eliminate other fixed costs in our restaurants and restaurant support center as well as eliminate non-essential capital spending. Given the significant reduction in cash flow, we also had to work quickly to ensure we had enough cash for whatever might occur. During the quarter we suspended the dividend and share repurchases, fully drew down our $750 million credit facility, took out a $270 million term loan and raised over $500 million in a follow on equity offering. All these efforts, and the strong loyalty of our guests resulted in us tripling our prior To Go sales run rate averages, and materially reducing our cash burn as we disclosed to you through our periodic business updates. Given the confidence in our cash flow trends and the ability to access it in the future, we fully repaid our credit facility in early May. Now turning to the results. The total sales were $1.3 billion, a decrease of 43.0%. Same-Restaurant sales decreased 47.7% and adjusted diluted net loss per share was $1.24. Because of the significant reduction in total sales compared to last year, all of the expense lines experience sales deleverage, so I'll just touch on a few highlights. First, Food and Beverage costs were higher as a percent of sales given menu mix related to both To Go mix and simplified menus, as well as increased packaging expense and elevated beef cost. As we look at the labor line, there was significant deleverage in management labor, including approximately $25 million in manager bonuses. However, we saw an improvement in hourly labor as a percent of sales of over 150 basis points even with a substantial reduction in sales. Restaurant expenses per operating week decreased over 20% given our focus on cost management, even as we incurred over $5 million in incremental cleaning supplies and PPE related to COVID-19. For marketing and G&A expense, we were able to reduce the absolute spend by $37 million and $17 million respectively versus last year. Included in our restaurant labor, and to a small extent G&A is approximately $50 million of investment net of retention credit. This was related to emergency and furlough pay for our team members while they were not working. This negatively impacted our EPS by $0.30 which was not adjusted out of reported earnings. During the quarter, we impaired $390 million of assets as a result of lower sales, reduced profitability and lower market to capitalization. The impairments related to $314 million of Cheddar's goodwill and trademark assets, $47 million of restaurant level assets and $29 million of other assets. We permanently closed eleven restaurants in the quarter, six of which were already impaired. The entire $390 million of impairment charges were adjusted out of our reported earnings. We ended the quarter with $763 million in cash and another $750 million available in our credit facility. This gives us over $1.5 billion of liquidity available to weather the crisis and make appropriate investments to grow profitably. Our adjusted debt-to-adjusted capital at the end of the quarter was 61% well within our debt covenant of 75%. As we shifted to an off-premise only model, we took a disciplined approach to pursue sales opportunities, with an eye toward incremental profitability and cash flow by focusing on cost management and the guest experience, while ensuring our team members were taken care of. This approach resulted in a better finish to Q4 than anticipated and is the underpinning for the strength of our business model that is reflected in our first quarter financial outlook. Now turning to fiscal 2021 performance. In today's release, we provided quarter-to-date same restaurant sales and the performance of our restaurants with dining rooms at least partially open. These results are encouraging with last week's blended same-restaurant sales down 30%, we are operating cash flow positive at these levels. Our To Go sales remain elevated in restaurants with dining rooms at least partially reopened. Olive Garden To Go sales are approximately double their pre-COVID averages and LongHorn has more than tripled their pre-COVID averages and LongHorn has more than tripled their pre-COVID averages in these restaurant. While it is our normal practice to provide an annual financial outlook, due to the uncertainty in business performance moving forward, we are only providing an outlook for the first quarter. We expect to achieve approximately 70% of prior year sales levels, total EBITDA of at least $75 million and diluted net earnings per share of greater than or equal to zero on a diluted share base of 131 million shares. At this point, we don't intend to further share intra quarter business updates since we have provided our first quarter outlook. For the full year, we intend to open between 35 and 40 net new restaurants. Our first opening of the year is expected to be in early July, with a few others likely to be opened by the end of the first quarter. In total, we expect between $250 million and $350 million of capital spending for fiscal 2021. Turning to other aspects of capital allocation. As you recall we suspended our dividend last quarter due to the level of cash flow uncertainty and the need to preserve as much cash as possible. We have been consistent in our commitment to returning cash to shareholders, and our dividend is a big part of that. As soon as we see the business begin to generate the sustainable cash flows to support a dividend and repay our term loan, we will have discussions with our board on our dividend policy. And now I'll turn it back to Gene for some closing comments. Well, Andrew, it was actually both. I mean, we did a top-down look at where we are geographically. What we've been running lately. And our brands did our own bottom-up look at it by geography et cetera, and we came to around the same number. And so, if you look at what we have, we're seeing approximately 70%, which is where we are after three weeks of this quarter. Now mind you, the restaurants that are open, with dining rooms open are doing a little bit better than that. But we just want to make sure that we don't know exactly when all the dining rooms are going to open. We don't know when if there's going to be another wave or of some closures. We're hoping that doesn't happen. But that's where we came up with our 70% number for sales. And then on the profit side, as you saw in our fourth quarter, we did much better job in controlling costs and expenses and everything else. And so, we just have a stronger business model, which makes us feel comfortable with our EPS of zero or greater and a $75 million or greater EBITDA. And that's total EBITDA in that restaurant level, that everything. Yeah. As of today we have somewhere between 10% to 15% of our restaurants that are putting up positive same restaurant sales. There are restaurants that have good solid off-premise business. And they've got a business that kind of goes all day. There an trade areas where even early in the week you've got business from two to five and after eight. So 10% to 15% of our restaurants today are positive same restaurant sales. Yes, Peter, this is Rick. Something did changed during this environment. We actually canceled our loyalty program test. And that ended at the end of the fiscal year. And it ended for a couple of reasons. One is, we've had it out there for a while. We had seen some incremental improvement over time. But we just didn't think this is the right time to continue to invest in that. We wanted to streamline everything we were doing. That said, there is a chance that we'll bring one back in the future. We did get some good data out of a loyalty test. So the data is richer than the data that we get from our credit cards and other things. The real question was, do we have enough of that to utilize to market and to do the right things? And so, we cancel the test again to streamline to ensure that we're focusing on the things that are most important right now. That said, we may come back with another loyalty program in the future. Well, everything that we're anticipating is in our guidance. They could be impacted. That said, we don't know if they're going to be expanded, right. Are they're going to be extended or they can be extended at different dollar amount. There's still some discussions along those lines. And so, we put everything in there. There's some positives in that could happen or some negatives can happen. And that's why we felt that our 70% sales number against last year was the right number. Yes. A couple of things. One is, we had $58 million of costs that we did not adjust out of our earnings that we won't have in this quarter. As we talked about before, the $58 million of investments that we made, $50 million of that was definitely -- not definitely, but it was an impact that we wouldn't expect to happen going forward. That's one. And two. When we came into this and started declining fast, it took us a little bit of time to get some of those costs out, right? So, you go from a positive sales in one week to negative 75% and within a couple of weeks it takes you a little bit of time to move those costs. Now, we have all the fixed costs where we like them. And so with a 70% sale -- so a 30% reduction versus last year we can be profitable. Sara, this is Rick. In terms of opening cadence for the year, recall, we stopped construction in the fourth quarter. And a lot of those restaurants were either done or close to done. So the restaurant that's opening in July was pretty much already completed. And so, we will have some restaurants that can open quickly if we want them to. We're opening as I said one in July. We've got probably handful more that will open by the end of the quarter. And that we're doing to make sure that we can train in social distancing and make sure that we're training the teams correctly. And then after that we've got a lot of and that can open. As soon as we think that we can serve the guests need that's coming into that restaurant. And so, we can flip the switch fairly quickly. But the likelihood is it'll be a little bit more backend loaded just because we want to see what the environment is before we open a restaurant at limited capacity. Yes. I would look back at historical. Our plan this year is to open at least one restaurant for every brand. And some of them again, we're already under construction. But the majority of our openings will be Olive Garden and LongHorn. Yes, Sarah. Cost of sales was unfavorable to us in the fourth quarter. A lot of it because of mix in brands, mix in To Go business and the higher expense for packaging. Unlike other brands we actually put our packaging costs in our cost of sales. It's not in restaurant expenses; it's in cost of sales. So when you think about how much we shifted To Go and we had some value platforms in To Go, Olive Garden did buy one take one for almost the whole time for To Go. So that was a higher cost of sales. We had we had To Go packaging for more entrees than normal. We had bundles at some of the other brands. So it was really a mix up To Go and mix of what we were selling. And then brand mix is a little bit of that. But it's not too much, except for the fact that our higher end brands actually had a lower same restaurant sale, so a bigger negative. And some of those brands have a fairly good cost of sales measure. On the labor front, it was all deleverage as we talked about -- as I talked about in the prepared remarks. We had restaurant managers we paid them even when they were on furlough. We had -- we kept most of our restaurant managers throughout this downturn. We had the $58 million of those expenses that Gene mentioned. That was in our restaurant labor. Primarily there was a little bit in G&A, but most of it was in restaurant labor. So that hurt our margin on that front too. Those are things that we don't expect to continue. What we do expect to continue is deleverage in the restaurant manager labor line because that's a fixed cost. But we do have some as we said some favorability on the hourly labor side. That's how we think about it. No. I think it was a little bit of value add, but not much. I think it was really -- there was just a -- there was a handful of products that weren't providing a whole lot of value to the consumer that caused a lot of chaos and a lot of additional prep and cost in the kitchen that we just removed from the menu. And our guests haven't been asking for it back. So I mean, there's just a lot of streamlining. But that menu has come down to a lot simpler. And they did some really good procedural work from the back door to the front -- to the dining room table that has just made it easy to execute. Andrew, this is Rick. Yes, I made the comment on margins. And there are a lot of investments we can make. One of them is to bring marketing back. And so we took -- we're taking marketing down significantly. Now, we'll still have some number in our P&L in Q1 for marketing as percent of sales. So, I would encourage none of you to put zero in there. We do have some marketing, but we significantly reduced it. These menu simplifications that we made. Are there some items that we need to bring back as we do some more research down the road when we have full dining rooms? Do we have enough breadth of appeal? And so, if we bring them back how do we do those. How do we bring those back with a simplified process. But it would still be a small investment. So there are other investments that we can make. We can make investments in taking less pricing, because we have margin to do that. We can make investments in quality which we're doing right now. LongHorn has just made some more significant quality investments in their menu even throughout this process. I don't know if it's in the restaurant yet, but its coming. It's a higher ounce weight for one of their best products without really pricing for it significantly. Olive Garden is making some significant investments right now in their menu in terms of a better quality and better value. And so, we still have a lot of investments that we can make. We're not going to talk necessarily about what we're going to look forward -- whether we make those investments or not. But just be sure to know that the margin that we have today gives us room to make investments or gives us room to drive into the bottom line. Hey, Jon, this is Rick. That's actually a difficult question to answer, because every restaurant is different in their layout. Not every restaurant, but a lot of restaurants are different in their layout. And we actually showed in our presentation what they're doing today. So what the restaurants are doing that are open. What are they doing in total sales and To Go sales and kind of get an idea of where they are. We think we can make that a little bit better overtime with some of these barriers that we're looking at. But any one brand is different. It's kind of hard to tell you exactly what percent we can do. It all also depends on how much people are willing to go on the shoulders of a meal period. And so, as the capacity constraints happen are people willing to wait a little bit longer or come in a little bit earlier and that'll help us drive more sales. But I couldn't tell you exactly what percent is the right number. Jon, as regards to the 150 basis points how much can stick as sales go up. All of -- our hourly labor is primarily variable. So unless we're making some significant changes to our menu or where we have to bring in some training again because there's a little bit less training in the fourth quarter. That would be the reason that our labor as a percent would go up. Or if we determine as we look at our guests experience, did we take a little bit too much out. And so, we don't believe that was the case because a lot of this labor came out of the kitchen. But we'll look at and see that and determine whether we need to bring some of it back. But I would still say that the first quarter should have an hourly labor benefit. Now remember, it's going to be offset by deleverage in the management labor side. And so, if you can remind me the second question, sorry. On the capital front, yes, when we raised that additional $500 million in capital, we said it was to invest in growth and to shore up our balance sheet. And so, we believe our balance sheet is shored up as we mentioned our adjusted debt to adjusted capital ratio of 61% and our covenant is 75%. Had we not raised that capital we would have been a lot closer to that covenant. We are making investments in growth. Right now, as I mentioned, some of the investments that we're making are investments in quality. We're using some of that capital to invest in quality. We use some of that capital to invest in our team. As Gene mentioned, so the things that we did that we think are going to benefit us in long term. We now have the capital to be able to start growth again And as we've said, we're going to start opening restaurants again. We think that others might not have as much of a balance sheet to be able to do that. And so, those are the investments we're talking about today. And we'll continue to look at other ways to invest that capital for future growth. We think there's tremendous opportunity to invest. And that's why we took out that extra equity. All right, John. So the 35 to 40 restaurant is really almost gross and net. So there, we don't have a whole lot of closings that we would anticipate in this fiscal year. We just closed eleven restaurants in the fourth quarter. Some of them were already impaired and the rest of them we impaired when we closed them. And so if we had something that we were going to close, we already did it, unless we had something where the lease wouldn't allow us to close. So we don't anticipate closing any more restaurants this year unless there's a lease expiration that we couldn't move or if something gets damaged in other ways. So the gross to net is about the same. In terms of CapEx, the 250 to 300, remember we had stopped construction of 17 restaurants that were supposed to open in Q4 or in the fourth quarter really of FY 2020. And so a lot of that CapEx has already been spent. Even if we ramp up development, we wouldn't be able to ramp it up enough to spend a lot of CapEx in the late FY 2021 for FY 2022. We're not ready to talk about FY 2022 openings. So if you take out the 17 openings that we had delayed from FY 2020 to FY 2021 that cuts to 35.5. Right. And it cuts the 40 down to 23. And so we do believe, we could get to the 2% to 3% unit growth, get back to that fairly quickly. We'll probably be close to that this year when you think about the 35 to 40. The question will be 22 and how fast do we ramp up development when we have to make sure that the landlords and the landowners and the construction folks understand there's probably a new price out there today. And so that takes a little bit of time for price discovery. And so we'll see how long it takes us to ramp back up. We have the team to be able to do it, and we're ready to do it when we need it. On the maintenance side I think, I mentioned $100 million to $120 million. It's not too different than what we've been doing before. Remember, our number one priority with Capital is to make sure our restaurants are maintained beautifully. And we've been consistent in that all along. And so, we do not want to cut down on maintenance that is essential than it is needed, and we believe, maintaining our restaurants is essential maintenance. So while we did reduce that during the fourth quarter because basically restaurants weren't very busy, we will bring that back. And that's why we've got 100 million to 120 million in our CapEx number for this year. Matt, and as it relates to sales to get back to our EBITDA, yes you're right. It's about 600 million is what you mentioned on the 30%. We don't need all 600 million to get back to that EBITDA based on what our margin structure looks like today. You know I'm not going to give you exactly what we need, but it it's not 100% of what we were doing before. That said, the reason I'm not going to give you that number is because we may invest some of that stuff. Some of that back. So I don't want, I don't want to add a number to say it's 90%, 95% or 100% because we're going to do the right thing for our guests and our team members to make sure that this cost structure that we have today is the right cost structure in the future. And if it's not we'll make some investments. But I will say that those investments may take a little bit of time. So we will have a better flow through in the first quarter on some of these sales than we would have had in the past. Okay. This is Rick. On a brand by brand level to tell you what the margin differences are, and what we've done that's it could be pretty, pretty long conversation. But I would say that as Gene mentioned earlier, Cheddar's made a lot of change to their menu, and a lot of change in their procedures to bring a lot of direct labor out of the system. So if you think about kind of an order of magnitude Cheddar's had the most change in their menu and the improvement in their labor cost over time. All of our brands are doing better in direct labor as a percent of sales than they were last year. All of them, Cheddar's is doing a lot better. But to tell you exactly what we did, again, all brands did things differently, all brands change their menus a little bit differently. But all brands focused on and we went into it optimists only model. They focused on how can we serve? What can we serve? What are our highest value items? What are highest guest satisfaction items, and what are the items that we can actually run it with just managers. And so if you think about brands, like Cheddar's, like Capital Grille, the smaller you know the specialty brands most of their To Go sales when they were To Go only were done with managers only. So we had to simplify that menu. And Olive Garden also simplified even though they had team members in the restaurant at the same time. But those simplifications again were to streamline the menu to the most value item, value items for the guest and the ones that the guest wanted the most. And so what's interesting now, and without the menu marketing and the different things that we do on a menu development, you know guests are voting with what they're buying. And it's amazing what as we simplified the menu we can actually see what the guest's favorites really are. And the great thing is, for a brand like Olive Garden, it's a few products that are on a few different menu items and so it actually is better to keep it that way because we streamline. And so without giving you specific examples, those are some kind of high levels of how we did it. And again, all brand had hourly labor efficiency improvements and we expect those to stay maybe not as good as they were, but we expect the efficiencies to stay."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Darden Fiscal Year 2020 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Please go ahead.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation will include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2020 fourth quarter earnings on June 25 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. Given the circumstances, we will only briefly discuss third quarter results and will spend majority of the time discussing the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, I want to remind everyone about the calendar shift that moved Thanksgiving from the second quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year, resulting in one fewer operating day for our casual dining brands during the third quarter. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene.\nGene Lee: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I want to acknowledge that we\u2019re clearly in a time of uncertainty as it relates to COVID-19. I know you have a lot of questions relating to the future, and we will try to answer them the best we can. First, I want to say thank you to our teams who are doing a great job managing through this adversity. Additionally, I want to thank them for the outstanding job they did in the third quarter, our results were impressive. As you see from our press release this morning, total sales from continuing operations were $2.35 billion, an increase of 4.5%. Same-restaurant sales increased 2.3% and adjusted net earnings per share were $1.90. However, today we're clearly faced with more pressing matters to discuss, given the rapidly changing environment and ongoing impact associated with COVID-19. To that end, I want to share with you what the Darden team is doing as it relates to the virus and the impact to our operations. Rick will share some of our quarter-to-date results and analysis on potential financial impacts. Turning to our ongoing response. We've established a cross-functional crisis team led by me, and we're in close contact with the CDC and other government agencies to ensure we have the most up to date information to inform the decisions we are making. We have developed an action plan addressing business continuity, operations, communication and supply chain. Our plan is updated as we receive and process new information. The health and safety of our team members, their families and our guests remain our -- remains our top priority, and we continue to take steps to ensure the safety of our hourly team members and restaurant management teams. Yesterday, we announced that we're implementing an emergency pay program that will cover hourly team members for two weeks in restaurants facing a business disruption. This is in addition to the permanent paid sick leave policy we announced last week. At this point, we don't see any major impacts to our supply chain. We have been in discussion with all of our major suppliers and they are confident that they can continue to supply our restaurants with safe, consistent goods to maintain service to our guests. Our restaurant teams are well-trained in food safety, sanitation and managing through viruses. We are regularly cleaning our restaurants with products that are on the CDC list of approved cleaning agents for COVID-19. We are confident that we'll be able to maintain a steady flow of these products into our restaurants. We are committed to keeping our restaurants open where permissible to be able to provide meals to the community in which we operate, whether that be off-premise or dine-in where permitted. And I'll reiterate that we are committed to the health and safety of our team members and guests by offering limited or no contact, curbside pickup and practicing social distancing in our seating configurations in all locations where we are permitted to operate our dining rooms. While we have a strong balance sheet and a strong cash position, given the material declines we're seeing in our business, we'll have to make dramatic change to our cost structure and cut non-essential spending. I'd like to emphasize that this is a rapidly changing environment, and as such, we are not able to reasonably estimate the impact to our business. The analysis that Rick will be providing are theoretical in nature and won't be able to predict the duration or scope of the impact at this time. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying that we actually had a pretty strong third quarter with same-restaurant sales of 2.3% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90. But obviously that is behind us and we're now focused on dealing with the unfolding situation. Instead of going through the detailed financial results for this quarter in my prepared remarks, we have most of our usual financial discussion slides in the additional information section of our presentation. Turning to our results so far in the fourth quarter, the shift in business momentum has been swift after announcements from state and local governments limiting restaurant operations. For context, Darden's same-restaurant sales were positive 3% in the first week, the second week was basically flat and the third week was down almost 21%. Same-restaurant sales for our third fiscal week ending March 15 by segment where Olive Garden was down 18.7%; LongHorn down 15.9%; Fine Dining, down 27.7% and other business down 27.5%. Our presentation has trends by week for our segments. Turning to our current week sales, through yesterday, same-restaurant sales are down roughly 60%. As of 4:00 pm yesterday, 60% of our restaurants are mandated ToGo only, 16% have mandated other capacity constraints and the remaining 24% have no mandates. But we are choosing to operate them at reduced capacity of approximately 50%, while practicing social distancing recommended by health officials. To that end, we've made the following decisions in conjunction with our Board. First, we have announced that the Board has suspended our quarterly dividend payment. The Board intends to review our quarterly dividend policy as developments warrant. Second, out of an abundance of caution, we are fully drawing down our $750 million credit facility to further shore up our cash balance, resulting in approximately $1 billion on our balance sheet. Third, we are limiting cash outflows by more aggressively managing costs and significantly reducing CapEx. Finally, given the level of volatility and uncertainty surrounding the future impact of COVID-19 on the broader U.S. economy and any specific impact to our company, we have withdrawn our previous fiscal 2020 guidance issued December 19, 2019. In the absence of specific guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we want to provide EPS sensitivity for the quarter. Assuming most restaurants have partial operations such as ToGo only, you can assume that for each percentage point decline in sales for the fourth quarter, which is 14 weeks, diluted earnings per share will decline approximately $0.06 to $0.08. During these uncertain times, it's important to understand the strength of our balance sheet and history of our cash flows. To that end, when looking at our historical operating cash flows, we've been able to generate enough cash to more than fund all of our needs. And while I can't predict the level or length of any reductions to our sales, assuming a sales decline of 50% for the entire fourth quarter would result in negative operating cash flow of approximately $300 million for the quarter, including change in net [technical difficulty]. As I mentioned earlier, we have approximately $1 billion in available cash. Given that, I believe we'll be able to weather this disruption to our business. And with that, we'll take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. As the country's largest casual dining company, it certainly makes sense that you'd be having discussions with the government right now. It's also my understanding that the industry, in particularly the casual dining segment has been the united front and asking for some sort of a direct relief plan. Could you talk about some ideas that are realistically being considered, even if you're not counting on them for Darden survival? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Good morning, David. Yes, we -- and I have been in contact with the administration and members of Congress to help them understand the unique challenge that we face in the full service sector. The priority of those discussions have been on developing a plan to be able to continue to keep our team members on our payroll, trying to develop a plan which would use government money to pay them and not have to separate with our 190,000 team members. That's been the focus of our discussions at this point.\nDavid Palmer: And is there a mechanism that they have decided on or even thought about to get that done?\nGene Lee: No, I believe that -- I mean, at this point in time, we're early in the discussion and there's just a lot happening in D.C. But they are well aware of the situation that full service casual dining company owned companies are really facing, it's a company - different than franchise.\nDavid Palmer: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett.\nJeff Farmer: Thank you. You did touch on it, but what is your monthly cash burn rate in the scenario as you outlined where the restaurant dining rooms are closed and you're only able to serve off-premise? And as a follow-up to that, I'm just curious if you think you can keep that off-premise number at Olive Garden, anywhere close to that, I think it's $14,000 to $15,000 per week in a normalized environment?\nGene Lee: Hey, Jeff. On a takeout only scenario, we would expect the variable margin to be positive. And so that's very important for us is to make sure that we have positive variable margin on takeout. But our total EBIDTA will be negative. We do believe that we can build and we're seeing build in ToGo sales at Olive Garden and at LongHorn Steakhouse, significant growth in ToGo during this time period. I will say on a fully closed scenario, which is what we talked about a little bit ago, a fully closed scenario, a run rate, cash burn rate is about $40 million to $50 million. But we think a full close is unlikely, closing everything, including ToGo. Any variable margin -- sorry, one more thing, any variable margin we get from the takeout really helps offset that fully closed cash burn rate.\nJeff Farmer: That's helpful. But that $40 million to $50 million that time period is over a month. Is that correct, or in a quarter?\nGene Lee: Yes, $40 million to $50 million a week \u2026\nJeff Farmer: Okay.\nGene Lee: \u2026 assuming we're fully closed. Now, we can probably take that cash burn rate down below $40 million. But that's just a range that we have and that's assuming we're fully closed again.\nJeff Farmer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs.\nKatherine Fogertey: Great. Thank you. Can you give us a little bit of color about how many people you would need in the restaurants if you're running ToGo only. And then, you kind of alluded to you\u2019re seeing a big boost on that Olive Garden and LongHorn around ToGo. Could you give some more granular numbers about how that comp trend has moved in the three weeks like you split out the overall side? And then just finally, I know that you guys have not partnered with third-party delivery before, but just wondering given this very unique set of circumstances here, does it make sense to maybe look at even a short-term solution on that front to help get food to customers? Thank you.\nGene Lee: It's taken us on average 6 to 10 team members ToGo only restaurants to operate. I would suspect -- I think it's been all over the place and every day is changing dramatically. But I think when I looked at it yesterday, our off-premise business was growing about 20% versus last year. So it's picking up as people change their behaviors. As far as third-party goes, I would say that everything is on the table. However, what we're focused on right now is ramping up and using our team members to be able to keep them on our payroll and develop our own delivery capabilities, which our teams are ramping very, very quickly.\nKatherine Fogertey: So I understand you guys are looking at doing your own fulfilled delivery in certain markets?\nGene Lee: We're doing it now.\nKatherine Fogertey: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler.\nNicole Miller: Thank you. Good morning. How was the conversation with your lender, if you don't mind sharing, please? And then what is the intent, in your opinion, please, for lenders to deal with restaurants at any level? In the past, I would understand that they would let the ability to draw down on a revolver. And also -- and then covenants as needed. It's going to be important again, maybe not for Darden because you've already had the conversation, but for many, many of your peers going forward. If you could talk us through that, we'd really appreciate it. Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes, Nicole, we've had some really good conversations with our banks. We've got long standing relationships with them. They were with us during the crisis in 2008. And so we just as we said, as an additive of an abundance of caution, we drew down our revolver. They said they'd be there if we needed them before we did that. But we decided to do that just to get in front of anybody else that might want to. In the terms of our covenants, we haven't gotten to a point where we're breaking our covenants. And so we haven't had those discussions. And even with our stock price today, we'd still be within our covenant.\nNicole Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners.\nBrett Levy: Great. Thank you and thanks for having the call this morning. If you could talk a little bit about what would it be your conversations within -- with landlords, now that you're not the sole owner of your properties and you talked about labor over the first two weeks. How were you thinking about it over the more intermediate period of time, the following two weeks, the following two months? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes. Brett, we've had no conversations with our landlords at this point in time. We have stopped all construction of all new restaurants, and we're negotiating with those landlords to push off the commencement of rent. As far as labor goes, we've -- again, we've implemented our emergency pay policy for those that are being impacted from disruption standpoint. What we do into the future will really depend on what kind of relief we may get from the administration to help pay our people. But that's yet to be determined and we continue to have conversations. I'll have conversations with the leaders in Washington as soon as I get off this call. So I really can't give a whole lot of guidance to that.\nBrett Levy: No that makes sense. And just on the store capacity, what is your anticipation? What are you hearing from other jurisdictions that are currently either fully open or at half capacity? Do you have any sense on how we should think about the next two weeks in terms of just ongoing capacity within units that I\u2019ll [indiscernible]?\nGene Lee: Brett, the dynamic of this crisis is changing hourly. So I don't want to try to predict what is going to happen. All I can do is that we\u2019re going to react, I am in contact with the governors of the largest states to talk to them about how we believe that our environments, if we practice good social distancing, are some of the safest places to be. And we'll continue to have those conversations. But we are not in control of that. We will react to what the local government wants to do and we'll do the best job that we can. But I have no way of predicting what's going to happen.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.\nSara Senatore: Hi. Thank you. I have a question. If you could give me a little bit more insight into some of the consumer behaviors you're seeing with respect to, whether it's geographic dispersion or something else. Obviously, the whole country is watching this -- it's really a humanitarian cost. But to some extent, are you seeing different behaviors away from kind of the epicenters of the disease in the country on the coast, for example, it looks like some of the data we see suggests that, where your restaurants are in terms of population density or what parts of the regions of the country may make a difference. I ask only because as we try to think about how behaviors might change of this spread, I'm just trying to get a sense of, do you see differences in different parts of the country, depending on how -- what the immediate impact is, or is it more just everybody is kind of responding to the news that they're seeing. And it's really not distinct anyway. So any kind of nuance you can share as we try to think there how this might play out over time? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Well, I would say that obviously the parts of the country that were impacted first obviously were down significantly before other parts of the country. Again, I would say more towards the middle of the country you're seeing a little bit -- more of a normalized behavior. And then in most of the Northeast is pretty much shut down except for off-premise. So that\u2019s tough. And the numbers are very difficult to read at this point in time because we haven't had the chance to bifurcate our sales report to areas that are open for business, for -- with a dining room, with social distancing and those that are just open for ToGo. So our ability to analyze that has been a little difficult, just because it's changing so dramatically. But, overall, you could see it as business travel started to decline. All the business centers took a major hit. And now with various closing down, I can't say consumer behavior is changed. It's just it depends on the situation.\nSara Senatore: Okay. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on my -- yes.\nGene Lee: Sara, just one thing -- just to give people an understanding of Knapp region. I'm going to give you a range. So for the week that we just ended, the best Knapp region was one that's not having any forced closures, etcetera and that was Texas. That was down 29% roughly in the casual dining space. And the worst performing Knapp region was down 61%. So no matter what it is, all of these regions are down just because I think people are practicing their own social distancing. But that gives you a perspective on the casual dining business, the range of the impact.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just quickly on the cost, the cash flow, cash burn piece. And this is probably a naive question, but as I think about kind of the outlays, obviously you have rent and occupancy that you talked about still paying and then you\u2019re taking care of the people. Are there any other big buckets I should be thinking about as I think about what where this sort of cash outlays might be going, irrespective of what your revenues look like?\nGene Lee: You talked about most of them already. If you think about our rent expense on a weekly -- on a monthly basis, it's about $20 million of the $40 million. And so I'm sorry, restaurant expense. Rent is about $8 million. And so that's the highest non-salary expense in this cash burn. I'm sorry, and that's weekly, $8 million a week. Manager salaries, somewhere around the $10 million, but that can move if we have a very long prolonged impact, or if something happens on the government side. So we could take that down if we want to make sure that our people get paid somehow.\nSara Senatore: Okay.\nGene Lee: So that\u2019s -- those are the big buckets.\nSara Senatore: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Kind of understanding the survival mentality right now, I guess I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about advertising in this environment. You\u2019ve kind of long touted your robust digital capabilities. Is there anything you\u2019re doing in terms of mining that data to try to manage through the current environment?\nRick Cardenas: Andrew, with the sales results we\u2019re seeing now, we are focusing any advertising that we do on ToGo, especially for Olive Garden and LongHorn, but we have dramatically reduced our advertising spend, without getting into too many other things that would be competitive. We have significantly reduced our advertising spend, or we plan on significantly reducing where we can, but it would be focused on -- anything we do would be focused on our ToGo experience.\nAndrew Strelzik: Okay. And is there any more color you can provide on just what we should expect from CapEx?\nRick Cardenas: Basically the only CapEx we would have, we are focused on curbing any capital spend. We are managing it aggressively. And that really includes stopping all non-essential capital spending. As Gene mentioned, we are basically shutting down new restaurant construction where we can. And so that cash burn number I had told you before includes CapEx.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you so much. I have several, if I may. Firstly, what is that non-essential CapEx number? I know not the number that you necessarily want to sustain, but I mean how close to zero could you actually get while continuing to keep up the operation where you want it to be?\nRick Cardenas: Very low single-digit millions a week.\nJohn Ivankoe: Okay. All right. Wow. Yes, it\u2019s really -- it just shows how extraordinary this environment is. And then, secondly, and this is just going to be from just the restaurant operations perspective, I mean, some numbers are kind of thrown out. No gatherings, about 25 people or 50 people, I mean the numbers kind of seem to be getting lower. I mean, how do you handle that from a practicality perspective within the restaurant? I mean, is there a number of which you say, listen, we\u2019re going to have more than 25 people or 50 people, whatever it is, including a staff restaurant. Is there at any one point in time is kind of the first point? And secondly, just because I haven\u2019t seen it -- I mean, how do you practice social distancing with servers and buzzers and what have you with people that have to have closer than 60 contact with your customers? And then finally, is there any thought of moving to things like disposable or the types of dish where it\u2019s just so the cleanliness aspect or the kind of contact aspect can be as minimal as possible?\nGene Lee: It\u2019s a lot in there, John. You got it all in. Let me see if I can remember some of that. First thing we do is, once we get below 10 or less guests, we basically go right to ToGo. Most of our ordinance are 50% capacity or are a high number like 100 and how we execute that as we put someone at the front door and we count. And we\u2019ve the number of employees, we are working on in those environments, limited menus. So we\u2019ve got less employees in the building. We\u2019ve some high volume restaurants with limitations of 100 people in the building that are still doing some fairly good numbers. So I feel like we\u2019re really filling a need the consumer wants. As far as the social distancing with our team members, it\u2019s a challenge. Most importantly, we\u2019re working on hygiene. People are washing their hands, where we\u2019re sanitizing every table after every visit. And we\u2019ve instructed our people to really keep their face and back and be able to reach with their hands and be able to certainly get the best they can in that environment. To date, we are out of our 190,000 team members, we have no confirmed cases. We\u2019ve had a great protocol where we\u2019ve got a significant people -- significant amount of people that aren\u2019t allowed to work because they may have some sort of symptoms. But we\u2019ve got great processes in place. We deal with much more contagious viruses all the time, and we feel our dining rooms are some of the safest places right now. And there are other places that are open and operating that are nowhere near as safe as our dining rooms.\nJohn Ivankoe: And if you don\u2019t mind, Gene, I mean, you did kind of talk about, I mean, if I can have the language right, a dramatic change in your cost structure. I know we talked about on the restaurant side, is there anything on the G&A side that you would like to point out at this point of temporary versus restructural [ph] that you -- maybe your discretionary spend within the G&A side that does not involve headcount or possibly does involve headcount?\nGene Lee: John, other than me not taking a salary, yes, there\u2019s opportunity. So we\u2019ve cut all travel, we will continue to look at our staffing levels in the support center. I\u2019m not going to make any comments, all my people are listening. We are going to have to make -- there\u2019s going to be some sacrifices that are going to have to be made for the organization, and we will continue to look at that and evaluate that as we get a better understanding of what we are really facing and that changes daily.\nJohn Ivankoe: Gene, I know you are doing the best you guys can. Good luck with everything.\nGene Lee: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Thanks for the question. Gene, just wondering if you could provide any perspective on kind of how you\u2019re thinking about the industry and broadly the smaller change in the independence within this environment in particular, maybe relative to Darden\u2019s brands. I know the focus here is on the immediate and the near-term. And I know you don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but just any thoughts that you\u2019ve got perhaps on how you think Darden\u2019s brands are positioned, perhaps if we can look a little bit past and coming out of some of this relative to the competition if you care to share any of that? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Yes, I think we\u2019re too early on in this crisis for me to have an opinion on that. I think that the full service casual dining business is an important piece of the overall economic engine of the United States. You look at just the six top chains, we employ over a half a billion people. These are great jobs, and people love working for us and consumers love us. And I think that we are all innovative and we are creative. I think that we are going to fight as hard as we can to get our share of the off-premise business in this time. And I believe that we will all come out of it the bigger ones in a strong position. We all have great people. Our people love working for us. Our customers love us, and we just got to manage through this, and I think the industry will be fine.\nDennis Geiger: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company.\nBrian Bittner: Good morning. Thanks. Rick, the sensitivity analysis you gave us for the fourth quarter, I think you said every point in comp is worth about $0.06 to $0.08 of EPS. I\u2019m assuming that includes things like the emergency pay program to cover hourly workers and whatnot, but can you just help us better understand what are you doing on your core operating costs per unit when we think about that sensitivity analysis? I think you did a great job of explaining the cash burn and I think that\u2019s pretty straightforward, but just trying to understand the cost assumptions in that same-store sales sensitivity analysis a little bit more?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Brian. The $0.06 to $0.08 does include the emergency pay that we had mentioned. As you think about -- we\u2019re taking a more detailed look at every restaurant expense line right now. I don\u2019t have the answer for you now, but the cash burn isn\u2019t that different than the P&L burn in our -- in the scenarios that I gave you. We have ways to reduce that number even more if we need to. And so we\u2019re continuing to look at it, but remember we have a -- after we get the revolver draw down, we have $1 billion of cash, and we\u2019ve got a $40 million cash burn a week. So we\u2019ve got a lot of cash to be able to cover this for quite a while, if we have a full shutdown. So we are -- but we are looking very hard at every expense, figuring out ways that we can reduce those expenses. Some of them are easier than others to reduce. And some of those take conversations with other people, which we haven\u2019t had yet. But one of the easier ones is some of the daily contracts that we might have in the restaurant, some of the services that we do trash pickup, etcetera, because the restaurants aren\u2019t nearly as busy. So we are focusing on every expense. With the priority right now to ensure that we get our people paid until something happens that we can\u2019t anymore.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you. And Gene, it\u2019s a bold move to take your salary to zero, and I wish you guys luck.\nGene Lee: Thank you, Brian. We are going to be fine.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Howard Penney with Hedgeye.\nHoward Penney: Hey. Thank you for the question. I know this is going to be a difficult one to answer, but if you even hear conversations you\u2019re having with the government of different people that we don\u2019t have conversations with any thoughts on the duration and the timing of this, and what you might be looking at to determine the duration, or is it just basically the curves that we can all say? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Hi, Howard. I don\u2019t want to speculate. I\u2019m not an expert and I\u2019m looking at the same information every day, every hour that you are. And when you look at the curves that they are predicting, I mean, I think that what I\u2019m hearing is a peak at the end of May, beginning of June.\nHoward Penney: Awesome. Appreciate it. And thank you again for your commentary today. It's very helpful.\nGene Lee: Thank you, Howard. You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks for the question. I was just curious if you can go back to the off-premise conversation, and maybe talk about what you\u2019re doing differently, which maybe you haven\u2019t done in the past. I know you mentioned that you\u2019re ahead of everything\u2019s on the table, but have you considered maybe lowering the threshold for smaller delivery? And then, what your current stance is on third parties, if that\u2019s changed at all? And then just secondarily, on the -- on this dividend, I was just curious, what things do returns in normal? How will you determine the size of the dividend? Is that -- will you bring it back to the prior level or would you think about maybe the payout ratio on trailing earnings basis? Thanks.\nGene Lee: As for off-premise, I mean we are -- we\u2019ve already ramped up. We are doing delivery. We are bringing down the threshold where we\u2019ve the available people to make those deliveries. I mean, think of us at this point, well, at least within the next 24 to 72 hours, we will be pretty much deliver in Olive Garden wherever people want it to be delivered to. As I said earlier on third-party, everything\u2019s on the table. But right now, my obligation is to keep as many of my people working as possible. And I think that we can ramp up our own delivery much better. I will let Rick talk about the dividend.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Eric. Yes. As we mentioned, we did suspend the dividend. And all I can tell you is, the Board is going to reevaluate that dividend when the conditions change. I can\u2019t tell you where we will be, what the dividend will be. But I will say that in our capital returns to shareholders, the dividend is one of the most important things that we do to return capital to shareholders.\nEric Gonzalez: Thanks. Good luck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. My question, Gene, is on the pay of the hourly workers. I know you did the right thing. It seems to implement this emergency pay. But I just wanted to confirm the length of time that covers. And then, once that expires, what your thought processes on and how you keep these employees engaged for when times do get better down the road?\nGene Lee: Yes, David, I think the time commitment right now is once the disruption happened it\u2019s two weeks. But that is subject to change depending on what happens with these relief packages from the government. We know that the government is going to start sending people checks directly and not come through us. That has to be part of our calculation. And when we think about our people, we are going to try to keep people employed maybe through our furlough program where we can still have -- they can still have access to their benefits, and they don\u2019t lose their tenure. We are really, really trying to work through keeping our people engaged, so when it\u2019s time to ramp back up that we can ramp back up quickly. But we\u2019ve to continue to work in concert with the government. And if they\u2019re going to compensate the American public directly, then that has to be a part of our calculation as we think about our people.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. Thanks for that. And then, Rick, just in terms of cash priorities, I will be the optimist and thinking that you will work through the short-term period and then return to some sense of normalcy. So, I guess, what are your priorities once you get on the other side of this, would it be to pay down debt or would you be looking to reinstate the dividend sooner rather than later?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, David. Thanks for the question. One of the things that we\u2019ve said is, the dividend is very important to us. Even with the debt we are taking on, we feel comfortable with that level of debt, if we need to keep it all. What we will do is, look at the cash flow forecast going forward and prioritize if we can the dividend [technical difficulty] priorities of capital or maintaining our restaurants. So we have to continue to maintain the restaurants, make sure that they look great, then the dividend, then new unit growth and then share buyback. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve talked about for years. That hasn\u2019t changed, and we don\u2019t think this situation is going to change that. So, again, capital outlays, maintaining our restaurants, dividends, new unit growth, may be at a more tamed level depending on what happens going forward, and then share buyback. We will likely, if we pay down this revolver to get back to where we were before, but that\u2019s all in the calculus.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. Thank you and best of luck.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Rick clarify the comments around sensitivity. I think you said, this week comps were down 60%, down sharply from the 20% last week. So just to connect that guidance to your -- or to forward guidance, you said if comps are down 50% for the fourth quarter, cash burn would be $300 million, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s relative to the $1 billion you have to try and demonstrate your sustainability. But can you compare that to the comments you made have down $40 million to $50 million per week, are those all apples-to-apples or just want to clarify those details?\nRick Cardenas: Those aren\u2019t necessarily apples-to-apples, the $40 million to $50 million per week remember is assuming that we were completely closed, and that\u2019s on a run rate basis. The down 50% scenario that we gave to result in $300 million includes some of those run rate costs, include some of the emergency and it also includes the wind down of our negative net working capital, somewhat not all the way. But remember, the restaurant business is a negative net working capital business. And so as sales slow, we start giving back some of that working capital credit that we have. And over time, that working -- if we\u2019re closed completely, that working capital goes to -- goes away from a negative balance.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. So when you say the $40 million to $50 million per week burn, I\u2019d assume 100% close, you are not talking about just the in-restaurant, you\u2019re talking about this restaurant front doors locked, you would burn $40 million to $50 million a week? Got you. But this \u2026\nRick Cardenas: We are talking the door locked and nothing -- every light off.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got you. Okay. And then just to clarify that you said comps, if comps are down 50% this quarter, I think that was the frame of reference you gave at $0.07 per quarter. So you\u2019re talking about EPS reduced $3.50 or so from the prior estimate. So that means that the $0.06 to $0.08 sensitivity change, if comps fall more aggressively, that doesn\u2019t vary, where the comps are down 5 or comps are down 50, you\u2019re assuming there is no kind of bell curve on that which does assume a $0.06 to $0.08 per comp point for the fourth quarter?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, that\u2019s a good assumption. I think if it -- $0.06 to $0.08 for every comp point -- remember, for the full quarter and after first three weeks, we were only down 6% roughly. So \u2026\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got you.\nRick Cardenas: \u2026 but that assumes 50% for the entire quarter.\nJeffrey Bernstein: But ultimately -- just my last question, I mean, qualitatively when the virus fades, and we are hopeful that does soon, but any reason the business model in the earnings don\u2019t bounce back to full strength. I mean, implying no material change to, let\u2019s say, fiscal \u201922 earnings. I mean, most people value this company on future years. Just trying to make sure that any changes you\u2019re making today wouldn\u2019t necessarily change the long-term earnings growth dynamic from here?\nRick Cardenas: Jeff, what we are trying to do is make sure that we come out of this even stronger than where we were when we came into it. But it all depends on what happens to the consumer and the length and depth of this crisis economically. As long as people continue to get paid, we think there\u2019s a better chance that the bounce back is a quicker bounce back. If unemployment gets to some pretty high levels and people aren\u2019t getting paid, that\u2019s a different story. With that said, if those things happen and the inflation that we\u2019ve been seeing for the last couple of years probably goes the other way too. So we haven\u2019t looked two years into the future. We are looking hourly and weekly right now. But we believe that our position helps us become even stronger when we come out of this, but we can\u2019t comment necessarily on what the margin structure is going to look like in two years.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood.\nGene Lee: Hey, there\u2019s 10 people in the queue and I want to get to everybody. We have a hard stop at 9:30. We\u2019ve got to get back to taking care of some things. So if you could keep it just to one question, that would be great. So I want to give everybody an opportunity. But that would really be helpful. Thank you.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jake Bartlett with SunTrust.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. My only question is, just trying to understand the 60% that you talked about in the last week. I believe many jurisdictions have only limited dine-in sales, as a kind of Monday. So does that really just include half of the impact of that trend to kind of really get down to the run rate of sales?\nGene Lee: Yes, Jake, most of those jurisdictions started Monday. We saw a little bit of a slowdown from Monday to Tuesday. But Tuesday to Wednesday was about the same amount, so about down 60%. So as long as it stays that way, we hope that that will continue to be around that number, but we can\u2019t comment on what we actually think is going to happen. That said, we are getting better and better on our ToGo business too. So as it becomes ToGo only, we'd hope to continue to grow that.\nJake Bartlett: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you. It looks like you\u2019ve a small presence for Olive Garden in the Seattle market. And obviously this has been the site of the first U.S outbreak and perhaps a leading indicator for the rest of the country. So I\u2019m curious if you can talk about the progression of sales in recent weeks for this market to help with the potential analogue for the broader market. And then, Gene, any best practice you learn from the Seattle market to help extrapolate to the rest of the country, give me a little more time here. Thanks and I\u2019m [ph] hanging in there.\nGene Lee: Yes. Thanks, Jake. I would say that the Seattle market except for the Downtown area held very tough, and sales hung in there for a while until we started to close down the dining room. So it was a very -- it was okay in aggregate. I\u2019m making that comment based on looking at big groups and numbers, we are looking at the individual numbers and especially brands. I don\u2019t know if that we really learn anything that\u2019s going to help us throughout. I think the biggest challenge we\u2019ve right now is how do we really use our human resources and our creativity to ramp-up our off-premise businesses. And I\u2019ve a lot of faith in our leadership and our folks operationally to be able to really make this a real focus and keep this business growing throughout this crisis.\nAndrew Charles: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Rick, I was hoping you could go into maybe just a bit more detail about what the company\u2019s alternatives for cash liquidity would be if it happens to come to a point where you would need additional funds, and if you could just give a little bit more color there about some of the options that would be available. Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Chris. We are hoping not to need any additional options. And that\u2019s why we pulled down our revolver to get roughly $1 billion in cash on our balance sheet to get us through this. That said, we\u2019ve excellent banking relationships. We\u2019ve been discussing other options with our banks. I don\u2019t want to get into the details of that right now. But if we believe that, again, to be cautious we need a little bit more. We think we\u2019ve access to more without getting in any of the details.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. And I also appreciate all that you provided in this tough time. Rick, you talked about Knapp at different times. You talked about your own sales most recently. Can you just clarify or do you think your trends are consistent with Knapp or are you outperforming or underperforming, we are all trying to get a sense of the benchmark for the industry. Historically have Darden has outperformed that particularly in more challenging times? Can you just maybe, one, trip those numbers; and two, talk about qualitatively do you think you\u2019re outperforming or underperforming peers?\nRick Cardenas: I would -- we don\u2019t have the Knapp for the most recent week that I just told you about. So it\u2019s hard for me to say whether we are outperforming them, but I believe we were outperforming before that. And we'd hope to continue to outperform. We have a lot of room to be able to grow our ToGo business. And the comment that I gave earlier was based on Knapp regions, so different regions of the country. And we don\u2019t have that level of data yet.\nJohn Glass: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. Percentage of the base now with the acquisition of Cheddar\u2019s that you skew towards tourism or travel, if you could give us an estimate on that? And then I had a follow-up on -- the follow-up when we come out of this. Gene, how do you think the process would be if God forbid, you did have a employee come down with COVID, say, in July or August, would you close down the store? Is this going to be something that is going to be treated greater than other viruses that might enter the building and cause closures of stores you believe?\nGene Lee: No, John. I think that depending on the situation how long -- when did the employee work, how many days prior were they out before they were diagnosed. What I\u2019m seeing in other businesses is that the retail establishments are not closing. We would do another level of cleaning if that was the case. But I wouldn\u2019t expect major closures over having an employee diagnosed with COVID-19.\nMatt DiFrisco: And then, on the tourist travel skew, if you don\u2019t mind?\nGene Lee: Yes. Matt, we don\u2019t have that in front of us, but I can tell you one of our biggest states is Florida. And that -- we are still operating under our own capacity restrictions of 50% utilization of our restaurant. Even with Cheddar\u2019s, Cheddar\u2019s was primarily a southeast brand. And we haven\u2019t seen as many mandated closures in the Southeast as we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the country. That said, tourism is likely down, but that\u2019s also in -- what we\u2019ve had in the last week. So if you think about the last couple of weeks, it was a big spring break time, and the week that we\u2019re in is a big spring break time. And then, the other thing is, the impacts that we\u2019re seeing are much more pronounced in fine dining than they\u2019re in the casual space right now. And that\u2019s in our presentation.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America.\nGregory Francfort: Hey. Thanks for the question. Just -- I know you commented on the revolver drawdown. Were you able to or did you make any changes to your amendments on those documents, the debt-to-capital covenant change at all or no?\nRick Cardenas: We did not make -- from what I understand, we did not make any amendments on any of our capital right now, any of our debt.\nGregory Francfort: Got it. And then, maybe just variable margin you talked about it. Is there a minimum hurdle at which variable margin is positive for ToGo mix, is that 5%, 10%, 15%, is there a level at which that doesn\u2019t become a variable margin positive? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Well, I mean, there -- if we do very little ToGo business, and we\u2019ve someone sitting there waiting to take the order. That\u2019s where the variable margin gets negative, but our variable margins are pretty good in ToGo. It\u2019s just a stair step, it\u2019s not as straight line on ToGo because you\u2019ve got somebody manning phones or something like that. That said, if our ToGo business gets to be too low and we look at it on an individual restaurant basis, if our variable margins are negative, we probably end up closing that restaurant. But it\u2019s still too early to determine that. We are also using -- we\u2019ve got managers in our restaurants, so they can help. They don\u2019t have as many things to do in the dining room, so they can do some ToGo. And so, we\u2019re able to maybe run a little bit, fewer hourly employees during this timeframe and use managers in some of this ToGo business as well.\nGregory Francfort: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Hey. Can you guys hear me?\nGene Lee: Yes.\nRick Cardenas: Yes.\nPeter Saleh: Yes. Great, thanks. Can you guys just talk a little bit about, if you have business interruption insurance. Does the business interruption insurance cover this type of situation on any kind of conversations you\u2019ve been having with your insurers would be helpful.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Peter. Yes, we do have business interruption insurance that covers the situation. The maximum we can recover is $10 million. And we think based on what\u2019s going on now, we will probably be able to recover all of that. And I will say that it\u2019s pretty rare to have some of this kind of coverage. And so, we were pretty fortunate that we were able to get this coverage. And we will hopefully try to keep it next year. Thanks.\nPeter Saleh: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAndy Barish: Yes. I\u2019m all set. Questions have been asked. Thanks for the time and stay safe.\nGene Lee: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo.\nJon Tower: Hey, great. Hopefully you can hear me okay. The question that I had was on -- we talked about the lender side of the equation with respect to negotiating power, but can you talk about perhaps any discussions you\u2019ve had with landlords about the potential of deferring rent -- rental payments in the future periods. Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Jon. Other than the mention that Gene said about new restaurants slowing down construction, we haven\u2019t had discussions yet with landlords on deferring rent or delaying our rent payments. We\u2019re hoping not to have to get to that point, but we are probably going to start some discussion, just to be sure that we have enough capital later. But we might not need to do that.\nJon Tower: Great. Thank you. Good luck.\nRick Cardenas: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: Great. Thank you so much for squeezing me in, and I hope you can hear me clearly. My question was just around whether you guys have had conversations with the rating agencies at this point, and how much flexibility they are willing to afford, given sort of the fluidity of the nature of what we are seeing with COVID and some of your liquidity needs? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Priya. We have conversations with our rating agencies throughout the year, and we\u2019ve had conversations with them more recently. I can\u2019t comment on where they\u2019re saying -- what they\u2019re saying about COVID-19, but I think they are looking at every company\u2019s rating right now based on the results. But, yes, we are having conversations with them.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Kalicak for closing remarks.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you. That concludes our call. I would like to remind you that we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 25. Thank you for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your call for today. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gene Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I want to acknowledge that we're clearly in a time of uncertainty as it relates to COVID-19. I know you have a lot of questions relating to the future, and we will try to answer them the best we can. First, I want to say thank you to our teams who are doing a great job managing through this adversity. Additionally, I want to thank them for the outstanding job they did in the third quarter, our results were impressive. As you see from our press release this morning, total sales from continuing operations were $2.35 billion, an increase of 4.5%. Same-restaurant sales increased 2.3% and adjusted net earnings per share were $1.90. However, today we're clearly faced with more pressing matters to discuss, given the rapidly changing environment and ongoing impact associated with COVID-19. To that end, I want to share with you what the Darden team is doing as it relates to the virus and the impact to our operations. Rick will share some of our quarter-to-date results and analysis on potential financial impacts. Turning to our ongoing response. We've established a cross-functional crisis team led by me, and we're in close contact with the CDC and other government agencies to ensure we have the most up to date information to inform the decisions we are making. We have developed an action plan addressing business continuity, operations, communication and supply chain. Our plan is updated as we receive and process new information. The health and safety of our team members, their families and our guests remain our -- remains our top priority, and we continue to take steps to ensure the safety of our hourly team members and restaurant management teams. Yesterday, we announced that we're implementing an emergency pay program that will cover hourly team members for two weeks in restaurants facing a business disruption. This is in addition to the permanent paid sick leave policy we announced last week. At this point, we don't see any major impacts to our supply chain. We have been in discussion with all of our major suppliers and they are confident that they can continue to supply our restaurants with safe, consistent goods to maintain service to our guests. Our restaurant teams are well-trained in food safety, sanitation and managing through viruses. We are regularly cleaning our restaurants with products that are on the CDC list of approved cleaning agents for COVID-19. We are confident that we'll be able to maintain a steady flow of these products into our restaurants. We are committed to keeping our restaurants open where permissible to be able to provide meals to the community in which we operate, whether that be off-premise or dine-in where permitted. And I'll reiterate that we are committed to the health and safety of our team members and guests by offering limited or no contact, curbside pickup and practicing social distancing in our seating configurations in all locations where we are permitted to operate our dining rooms. While we have a strong balance sheet and a strong cash position, given the material declines we're seeing in our business, we'll have to make dramatic change to our cost structure and cut non-essential spending. I'd like to emphasize that this is a rapidly changing environment, and as such, we are not able to reasonably estimate the impact to our business. The analysis that Rick will be providing are theoretical in nature and won't be able to predict the duration or scope of the impact at this time. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. Good morning, David. Yes, we -- and I have been in contact with the administration and members of Congress to help them understand the unique challenge that we face in the full service sector. The priority of those discussions have been on developing a plan to be able to continue to keep our team members on our payroll, trying to develop a plan which would use government money to pay them and not have to separate with our 190,000 team members. That's been the focus of our discussions at this point. No, I believe that -- I mean, at this point in time, we're early in the discussion and there's just a lot happening in D.C. But they are well aware of the situation that full service casual dining company owned companies are really facing, it's a company - different than franchise. Hey, Jeff. On a takeout only scenario, we would expect the variable margin to be positive. And so that's very important for us is to make sure that we have positive variable margin on takeout. But our total EBIDTA will be negative. We do believe that we can build and we're seeing build in ToGo sales at Olive Garden and at LongHorn Steakhouse, significant growth in ToGo during this time period. I will say on a fully closed scenario, which is what we talked about a little bit ago, a fully closed scenario, a run rate, cash burn rate is about $40 million to $50 million. But we think a full close is unlikely, closing everything, including ToGo. Any variable margin -- sorry, one more thing, any variable margin we get from the takeout really helps offset that fully closed cash burn rate. Yes, $40 million to $50 million a week ... ... assuming we're fully closed. Now, we can probably take that cash burn rate down below $40 million. But that's just a range that we have and that's assuming we're fully closed again. It's taken us on average 6 to 10 team members ToGo only restaurants to operate. I would suspect -- I think it's been all over the place and every day is changing dramatically. But I think when I looked at it yesterday, our off-premise business was growing about 20% versus last year. So it's picking up as people change their behaviors. As far as third-party goes, I would say that everything is on the table. However, what we're focused on right now is ramping up and using our team members to be able to keep them on our payroll and develop our own delivery capabilities, which our teams are ramping very, very quickly. We're doing it now. Yes, Nicole, we've had some really good conversations with our banks. We've got long standing relationships with them. They were with us during the crisis in 2008. And so we just as we said, as an additive of an abundance of caution, we drew down our revolver. They said they'd be there if we needed them before we did that. But we decided to do that just to get in front of anybody else that might want to. In the terms of our covenants, we haven't gotten to a point where we're breaking our covenants. And so we haven't had those discussions. And even with our stock price today, we'd still be within our covenant. Yes. Brett, we've had no conversations with our landlords at this point in time. We have stopped all construction of all new restaurants, and we're negotiating with those landlords to push off the commencement of rent. As far as labor goes, we've -- again, we've implemented our emergency pay policy for those that are being impacted from disruption standpoint. What we do into the future will really depend on what kind of relief we may get from the administration to help pay our people. But that's yet to be determined and we continue to have conversations. I'll have conversations with the leaders in Washington as soon as I get off this call. So I really can't give a whole lot of guidance to that. Brett, the dynamic of this crisis is changing hourly. So I don't want to try to predict what is going to happen. All I can do is that we're going to react, I am in contact with the governors of the largest states to talk to them about how we believe that our environments, if we practice good social distancing, are some of the safest places to be. And we'll continue to have those conversations. But we are not in control of that. We will react to what the local government wants to do and we'll do the best job that we can. But I have no way of predicting what's going to happen. Well, I would say that obviously the parts of the country that were impacted first obviously were down significantly before other parts of the country. Again, I would say more towards the middle of the country you're seeing a little bit -- more of a normalized behavior. And then in most of the Northeast is pretty much shut down except for off-premise. So that's tough. And the numbers are very difficult to read at this point in time because we haven't had the chance to bifurcate our sales report to areas that are open for business, for -- with a dining room, with social distancing and those that are just open for ToGo. So our ability to analyze that has been a little difficult, just because it's changing so dramatically. But, overall, you could see it as business travel started to decline. All the business centers took a major hit. And now with various closing down, I can't say consumer behavior is changed. It's just it depends on the situation. Sara, just one thing -- just to give people an understanding of Knapp region. I'm going to give you a range. So for the week that we just ended, the best Knapp region was one that's not having any forced closures, etcetera and that was Texas. That was down 29% roughly in the casual dining space. And the worst performing Knapp region was down 61%. So no matter what it is, all of these regions are down just because I think people are practicing their own social distancing. But that gives you a perspective on the casual dining business, the range of the impact. You talked about most of them already. If you think about our rent expense on a weekly -- on a monthly basis, it's about $20 million of the $40 million. And so I'm sorry, restaurant expense. Rent is about $8 million. And so that's the highest non-salary expense in this cash burn. I'm sorry, and that's weekly, $8 million a week. Manager salaries, somewhere around the $10 million, but that can move if we have a very long prolonged impact, or if something happens on the government side. So we could take that down if we want to make sure that our people get paid somehow. So that's -- those are the big buckets. It's a lot in there, John. You got it all in. Let me see if I can remember some of that. First thing we do is, once we get below 10 or less guests, we basically go right to ToGo. Most of our ordinance are 50% capacity or are a high number like 100 and how we execute that as we put someone at the front door and we count. And we've the number of employees, we are working on in those environments, limited menus. So we've got less employees in the building. We've some high volume restaurants with limitations of 100 people in the building that are still doing some fairly good numbers. So I feel like we're really filling a need the consumer wants. As far as the social distancing with our team members, it's a challenge. Most importantly, we're working on hygiene. People are washing their hands, where we're sanitizing every table after every visit. And we've instructed our people to really keep their face and back and be able to reach with their hands and be able to certainly get the best they can in that environment. To date, we are out of our 190,000 team members, we have no confirmed cases. We've had a great protocol where we've got a significant people -- significant amount of people that aren't allowed to work because they may have some sort of symptoms. But we've got great processes in place. We deal with much more contagious viruses all the time, and we feel our dining rooms are some of the safest places right now. And there are other places that are open and operating that are nowhere near as safe as our dining rooms. John, other than me not taking a salary, yes, there's opportunity. So we've cut all travel, we will continue to look at our staffing levels in the support center. I'm not going to make any comments, all my people are listening. We are going to have to make -- there's going to be some sacrifices that are going to have to be made for the organization, and we will continue to look at that and evaluate that as we get a better understanding of what we are really facing and that changes daily. Thank you, John. Yes, I think we're too early on in this crisis for me to have an opinion on that. I think that the full service casual dining business is an important piece of the overall economic engine of the United States. You look at just the six top chains, we employ over a half a billion people. These are great jobs, and people love working for us and consumers love us. And I think that we are all innovative and we are creative. I think that we are going to fight as hard as we can to get our share of the off-premise business in this time. And I believe that we will all come out of it the bigger ones in a strong position. We all have great people. Our people love working for us. Our customers love us, and we just got to manage through this, and I think the industry will be fine. Thank you, Brian. We are going to be fine. Hi, Howard. I don't want to speculate. I'm not an expert and I'm looking at the same information every day, every hour that you are. And when you look at the curves that they are predicting, I mean, I think that what I'm hearing is a peak at the end of May, beginning of June. Thank you, Howard. You bet. As for off-premise, I mean we are -- we've already ramped up. We are doing delivery. We are bringing down the threshold where we've the available people to make those deliveries. I mean, think of us at this point, well, at least within the next 24 to 72 hours, we will be pretty much deliver in Olive Garden wherever people want it to be delivered to. As I said earlier on third-party, everything's on the table. But right now, my obligation is to keep as many of my people working as possible. And I think that we can ramp up our own delivery much better. I will let Rick talk about the dividend. Yes, David, I think the time commitment right now is once the disruption happened it's two weeks. But that is subject to change depending on what happens with these relief packages from the government. We know that the government is going to start sending people checks directly and not come through us. That has to be part of our calculation. And when we think about our people, we are going to try to keep people employed maybe through our furlough program where we can still have -- they can still have access to their benefits, and they don't lose their tenure. We are really, really trying to work through keeping our people engaged, so when it's time to ramp back up that we can ramp back up quickly. But we've to continue to work in concert with the government. And if they're going to compensate the American public directly, then that has to be a part of our calculation as we think about our people. Hey, there's 10 people in the queue and I want to get to everybody. We have a hard stop at 9:30. We've got to get back to taking care of some things. So if you could keep it just to one question, that would be great. So I want to give everybody an opportunity. But that would really be helpful. Thank you. Yes, Jake, most of those jurisdictions started Monday. We saw a little bit of a slowdown from Monday to Tuesday. But Tuesday to Wednesday was about the same amount, so about down 60%. So as long as it stays that way, we hope that that will continue to be around that number, but we can't comment on what we actually think is going to happen. That said, we are getting better and better on our ToGo business too. So as it becomes ToGo only, we'd hope to continue to grow that. Yes. Thanks, Jake. I would say that the Seattle market except for the Downtown area held very tough, and sales hung in there for a while until we started to close down the dining room. So it was a very -- it was okay in aggregate. I'm making that comment based on looking at big groups and numbers, we are looking at the individual numbers and especially brands. I don't know if that we really learn anything that's going to help us throughout. I think the biggest challenge we've right now is how do we really use our human resources and our creativity to ramp-up our off-premise businesses. And I've a lot of faith in our leadership and our folks operationally to be able to really make this a real focus and keep this business growing throughout this crisis. No, John. I think that depending on the situation how long -- when did the employee work, how many days prior were they out before they were diagnosed. What I'm seeing in other businesses is that the retail establishments are not closing. We would do another level of cleaning if that was the case. But I wouldn't expect major closures over having an employee diagnosed with COVID-19. Yes. Matt, we don't have that in front of us, but I can tell you one of our biggest states is Florida. And that -- we are still operating under our own capacity restrictions of 50% utilization of our restaurant. Even with Cheddar's, Cheddar's was primarily a southeast brand. And we haven't seen as many mandated closures in the Southeast as we've seen in other parts of the country. That said, tourism is likely down, but that's also in -- what we've had in the last week. So if you think about the last couple of weeks, it was a big spring break time, and the week that we're in is a big spring break time. And then, the other thing is, the impacts that we're seeing are much more pronounced in fine dining than they're in the casual space right now. And that's in our presentation. Yes. Thanks."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying that we actually had a pretty strong third quarter with same-restaurant sales of 2.3% and diluted earnings per share of $1.90. But obviously that is behind us and we're now focused on dealing with the unfolding situation. Instead of going through the detailed financial results for this quarter in my prepared remarks, we have most of our usual financial discussion slides in the additional information section of our presentation. Turning to our results so far in the fourth quarter, the shift in business momentum has been swift after announcements from state and local governments limiting restaurant operations. For context, Darden's same-restaurant sales were positive 3% in the first week, the second week was basically flat and the third week was down almost 21%. Same-restaurant sales for our third fiscal week ending March 15 by segment where Olive Garden was down 18.7%; LongHorn down 15.9%; Fine Dining, down 27.7% and other business down 27.5%. Our presentation has trends by week for our segments. Turning to our current week sales, through yesterday, same-restaurant sales are down roughly 60%. As of 4:00 pm yesterday, 60% of our restaurants are mandated ToGo only, 16% have mandated other capacity constraints and the remaining 24% have no mandates. But we are choosing to operate them at reduced capacity of approximately 50%, while practicing social distancing recommended by health officials. To that end, we've made the following decisions in conjunction with our Board. First, we have announced that the Board has suspended our quarterly dividend payment. The Board intends to review our quarterly dividend policy as developments warrant. Second, out of an abundance of caution, we are fully drawing down our $750 million credit facility to further shore up our cash balance, resulting in approximately $1 billion on our balance sheet. Third, we are limiting cash outflows by more aggressively managing costs and significantly reducing CapEx. Finally, given the level of volatility and uncertainty surrounding the future impact of COVID-19 on the broader U.S. economy and any specific impact to our company, we have withdrawn our previous fiscal 2020 guidance issued December 19, 2019. In the absence of specific guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we want to provide EPS sensitivity for the quarter. Assuming most restaurants have partial operations such as ToGo only, you can assume that for each percentage point decline in sales for the fourth quarter, which is 14 weeks, diluted earnings per share will decline approximately $0.06 to $0.08. During these uncertain times, it's important to understand the strength of our balance sheet and history of our cash flows. To that end, when looking at our historical operating cash flows, we've been able to generate enough cash to more than fund all of our needs. And while I can't predict the level or length of any reductions to our sales, assuming a sales decline of 50% for the entire fourth quarter would result in negative operating cash flow of approximately $300 million for the quarter, including change in net [technical difficulty]. As I mentioned earlier, we have approximately $1 billion in available cash. Given that, I believe we'll be able to weather this disruption to our business. And with that, we'll take your questions. Andrew, with the sales results we're seeing now, we are focusing any advertising that we do on ToGo, especially for Olive Garden and LongHorn, but we have dramatically reduced our advertising spend, without getting into too many other things that would be competitive. We have significantly reduced our advertising spend, or we plan on significantly reducing where we can, but it would be focused on -- anything we do would be focused on our ToGo experience. Basically the only CapEx we would have, we are focused on curbing any capital spend. We are managing it aggressively. And that really includes stopping all non-essential capital spending. As Gene mentioned, we are basically shutting down new restaurant construction where we can. And so that cash burn number I had told you before includes CapEx. Very low single-digit millions a week. Yes, Brian. The $0.06 to $0.08 does include the emergency pay that we had mentioned. As you think about -- we're taking a more detailed look at every restaurant expense line right now. I don't have the answer for you now, but the cash burn isn't that different than the P&L burn in our -- in the scenarios that I gave you. We have ways to reduce that number even more if we need to. And so we're continuing to look at it, but remember we have a -- after we get the revolver draw down, we have $1 billion of cash, and we've got a $40 million cash burn a week. So we've got a lot of cash to be able to cover this for quite a while, if we have a full shutdown. So we are -- but we are looking very hard at every expense, figuring out ways that we can reduce those expenses. Some of them are easier than others to reduce. And some of those take conversations with other people, which we haven't had yet. But one of the easier ones is some of the daily contracts that we might have in the restaurant, some of the services that we do trash pickup, etcetera, because the restaurants aren't nearly as busy. So we are focusing on every expense. With the priority right now to ensure that we get our people paid until something happens that we can't anymore. Hey, Eric. Yes. As we mentioned, we did suspend the dividend. And all I can tell you is, the Board is going to reevaluate that dividend when the conditions change. I can't tell you where we will be, what the dividend will be. But I will say that in our capital returns to shareholders, the dividend is one of the most important things that we do to return capital to shareholders. Hey, David. Thanks for the question. One of the things that we've said is, the dividend is very important to us. Even with the debt we are taking on, we feel comfortable with that level of debt, if we need to keep it all. What we will do is, look at the cash flow forecast going forward and prioritize if we can the dividend [technical difficulty] priorities of capital or maintaining our restaurants. So we have to continue to maintain the restaurants, make sure that they look great, then the dividend, then new unit growth and then share buyback. That's what we've talked about for years. That hasn't changed, and we don't think this situation is going to change that. So, again, capital outlays, maintaining our restaurants, dividends, new unit growth, may be at a more tamed level depending on what happens going forward, and then share buyback. We will likely, if we pay down this revolver to get back to where we were before, but that's all in the calculus. Thank you. Those aren't necessarily apples-to-apples, the $40 million to $50 million per week remember is assuming that we were completely closed, and that's on a run rate basis. The down 50% scenario that we gave to result in $300 million includes some of those run rate costs, include some of the emergency and it also includes the wind down of our negative net working capital, somewhat not all the way. But remember, the restaurant business is a negative net working capital business. And so as sales slow, we start giving back some of that working capital credit that we have. And over time, that working -- if we're closed completely, that working capital goes to -- goes away from a negative balance. We are talking the door locked and nothing -- every light off. Yes, that's a good assumption. I think if it -- $0.06 to $0.08 for every comp point -- remember, for the full quarter and after first three weeks, we were only down 6% roughly. So ... ... but that assumes 50% for the entire quarter. Jeff, what we are trying to do is make sure that we come out of this even stronger than where we were when we came into it. But it all depends on what happens to the consumer and the length and depth of this crisis economically. As long as people continue to get paid, we think there's a better chance that the bounce back is a quicker bounce back. If unemployment gets to some pretty high levels and people aren't getting paid, that's a different story. With that said, if those things happen and the inflation that we've been seeing for the last couple of years probably goes the other way too. So we haven't looked two years into the future. We are looking hourly and weekly right now. But we believe that our position helps us become even stronger when we come out of this, but we can't comment necessarily on what the margin structure is going to look like in two years. Hey, Chris. We are hoping not to need any additional options. And that's why we pulled down our revolver to get roughly $1 billion in cash on our balance sheet to get us through this. That said, we've excellent banking relationships. We've been discussing other options with our banks. I don't want to get into the details of that right now. But if we believe that, again, to be cautious we need a little bit more. We think we've access to more without getting in any of the details. I would -- we don't have the Knapp for the most recent week that I just told you about. So it's hard for me to say whether we are outperforming them, but I believe we were outperforming before that. And we'd hope to continue to outperform. We have a lot of room to be able to grow our ToGo business. And the comment that I gave earlier was based on Knapp regions, so different regions of the country. And we don't have that level of data yet. We did not make -- from what I understand, we did not make any amendments on any of our capital right now, any of our debt. Well, I mean, there -- if we do very little ToGo business, and we've someone sitting there waiting to take the order. That's where the variable margin gets negative, but our variable margins are pretty good in ToGo. It's just a stair step, it's not as straight line on ToGo because you've got somebody manning phones or something like that. That said, if our ToGo business gets to be too low and we look at it on an individual restaurant basis, if our variable margins are negative, we probably end up closing that restaurant. But it's still too early to determine that. We are also using -- we've got managers in our restaurants, so they can help. They don't have as many things to do in the dining room, so they can do some ToGo. And so, we're able to maybe run a little bit, fewer hourly employees during this timeframe and use managers in some of this ToGo business as well. Yes. Hey, Peter. Yes, we do have business interruption insurance that covers the situation. The maximum we can recover is $10 million. And we think based on what's going on now, we will probably be able to recover all of that. And I will say that it's pretty rare to have some of this kind of coverage. And so, we were pretty fortunate that we were able to get this coverage. And we will hopefully try to keep it next year. Thanks. Hey, Jon. Other than the mention that Gene said about new restaurants slowing down construction, we haven't had discussions yet with landlords on deferring rent or delaying our rent payments. We're hoping not to have to get to that point, but we are probably going to start some discussion, just to be sure that we have enough capital later. But we might not need to do that. Thanks. Yes, Priya. We have conversations with our rating agencies throughout the year, and we've had conversations with them more recently. I can't comment on where they're saying -- what they're saying about COVID-19, but I think they are looking at every company's rating right now based on the results. But, yes, we are having conversations with them."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. You may begin.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings on March 19th before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and then Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the second quarter. As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today\u2019s call refer to estimated Knapp-Track excluding Darden, specifically, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse. During our fiscal second quarter, industry total sales growth was 1.2%, industry same-restaurant sales increased 0.3% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 2.3%. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gene.\nGene Lee: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you\u2019ve seen from our press release this morning, we had a good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.06 billion, an increase of 4.2%, same-restaurant sales increased 2% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.12. Looking at the industry overall. We continue to see that consumers are willing to visit brands with compelling value and strong in-restaurant execution. That\u2019s why we remain relentlessly focused on executing our back to basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere and supported with integrated marketing that resonates with our guests. We also continue to strengthen and leverage our four competitive advantages. One of those advantages is our results-oriented culture. Admits record low unemployment, I am proud to see our retention rates continue to improve. We have a compelling employment proposition and our ability to retain and staff our restaurants with the right people is an important driver of our success. Turning to brand highlights for the quarter. Olive Garden delivered its 21st consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 2.6%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 1.5% and 1.1% growth from new restaurants. Olive Garden outperformed the industry benchmark in same-restaurant sales and traffic by 120 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. As a reminder, Olive Garden had a difficult promotional ramp to start the quarter with Lasagna Mia comping over Buy One Take One for the first four weeks. Additionally, we made some changes to our promotional messaging and we reduced marketing spending. As a result, we had to make up some ground from negative same-restaurant sales at the beginning of the quarter. Sales trends improved as we moved into Never Ending Pasta Bowl with more comparable marketing spend. The Olive Garden team continues to focus on operational execution, convenience and everyday value. Delivering exceptional guest experiences remain a key priority for the restaurant teams. Olive Garden also continued to meet their guest need for convenience as off-premise sales grew 17% during the quarter, driven by strong preference for the $5 take-home offer. For the quarter off-premise sales represented 17% of total sales. Digital sales grew approximately 33% and represented 38% of total to go sales. Finally, as we noted last quarter, Olive Garden introduced a new weekday lunch menu with 21 options under $10 to strengthen everyday value. This platform continues to perform well and has seen meaningful improvements in lunch sales trends. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with Olive Garden\u2019s performance. They have the right strategy in place, and I\u2019m confident that they will continue to make the appropriate investments and execute at a high level, which will enable them to continue to grow market share. LongHorn Steakhouse had an outstanding quarter. Total sales grew 8.4%, driven by 1.7% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 6.7%, the brand\u2019s 27th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth. LongHorn outperformed the industry benchmark in same-restaurant sales and traffic by 640 basis points and 550 basis points, respectively. LongHorn\u2019s performance is a result of the adhering to their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement. Over the last four years, the team has made significant investments in the strategy and those investments continue to pay off. During the quarter, they introduced several enhancements to existing core menu items to further strengthen the quality of their food and beverage. And in order to tell their quality story more effectively, LongHorn team evolved their award-winning You Can\u2019t Fake Steak advertising campaign to better communicate their expertise and showcase their high quality stakes. The overall LongHorn experience is a key differentiator and their distinctive, relevant advertising continues to resonate with guests. LongHorn was designed as a very simple business and the operations team has done excellent job of finding opportunities to simplify to drive execution. During the quarter, they implemented a number of ideas that would result a direct feedback from restaurant teams. Additionally, our renewed focus on execution standards led to improved throughput during the busiest weekend hours this quarter. And finally, LongHorn continues to leverage the biggest competitive advantage, their unique culture. Manager retention reached another all-time high during the quarter and hourly retention rates remained at industry-leading levels. This high level of engagement is further evidenced by the fact that LongHorn\u2019s guest satisfaction rating for the quarter reached record levels across all key metrics. I\u2019m extremely proud of the discipline the LongHorn leadership team brings to the business and I\u2019m confident that adhering to their long-term strategy will continue to drive their momentum. Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen total sales increased 4.2%, driven by sales growth in new restaurants of 5.4% and partially offset by same-restaurant sales decline of 1.2%. We continue to see improvement in Cheddar\u2019s HR and operations metrics, which we know are foundational elements of running great restaurants. I\u2019m encouraged by these trends, knowing that the restaurants that have made these improvements are operating successfully. Overall staffing levels for manager and team members remain strong during the quarter and retention levels continue to move in the right direction. Hourly turnover improved by nearly 20 points compared to last year, and management turnover showed meaningful improvement as well. From an operations perspective, Cheddar\u2019s is a high-volume business that requires efficient throughput. One of the key operations metrics the team focused on during the quarter was speed of service, and they saw significant improvement versus last year. In fact, they saw strong improvement in the guest experience across all key metrics compared to last year. In addition to strengthening HR and operating fundamentals, the team also worked to improve the appeal of the amazing value Cheddar\u2019s offers. In October, they began providing every guest with their most craveable and highest rated menu item, their honey butter croissants. This is an element of guest service that we identified as an opportunity when we acquired the brand. Providing every guest with a warm honey butter croissant reinforces the wild value Cheddar\u2019s provides. After making the necessary operational adjustments to facilitate this new step of service and given the overall improvements the operations teams have made, this was the right time to roll it out. And the response from the guests and team members has been very positive. As I shared on the last call, this quarter, the Cheddar\u2019s team increased their working media spend and conducted numerous test and learns using a variety of marketing channels to drive awareness and trial. They are in the early stages of this learning and still have a lot of work to do. They will continue to invest the time, effort and resources in order to determine the most effective way to market the brand in the future. While I\u2019m encouraged by the results we\u2019re seeing, the work at Cheddar\u2019s is far from over. Team is working on the right priorities and I\u2019m confident they are moving in the right direction. And finally, the holidays is the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams, as they delight our guests and help create lasting quality memories. This time of the year is also a great reminder that being at service is at the heart of our business. We embrace a higher purpose of enhancing people\u2019s lives, which is why we serve with purpose to delight our guests, support our team members and make a better tomorrow. One of the ways we\u2019re working to make a better tomorrow is through our harvest program. One in eight households in our country live without consistent access to food. To help fight hunger, every one of our restaurants donates surplus food to local food banks and nonprofits in their communities on a weekly basis. More than 115 million pounds of food has been donated through this program. That\u2019s the equivalent of nearly 96 million meals. The impact of our harvest program takes on and added significance during the holidays, and I\u2019m so proud of the passion our team members have for it. On behalf of the management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our 185,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guest and communities. I wish all of you a wonderful holiday season. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Gene. Good morning, everyone. We had another good quarter with second quarter total sales growth of 4.2%, driven by 2.2% growth from the addition of 37 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2%. As I mentioned in last quarter\u2019s call, same-restaurant sales benefited by about 80 basis points this quarter, driven by two factors. First, an increase of approximately 100 basis points due to Thanksgiving moving from the second quarter in fiscal 2019 into the third quarter in fiscal 2020. As a reminder, the third quarter should see a corresponding decrease to same-restaurant sales because of this shift. And second, approximately 20 basis points of headwind due to the impact of Hurricane Dorian early in the second quarter. Second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.12, an increase of 21.7% from last year\u2019s diluted net earnings per share. We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $136 million in shares, returning over $240 million to our shareholders this quarter. Additionally this quarter, we had $0.91 of adjustments to our reported diluted net earnings per share. This was primarily the result of a $147 million pretax charge related to the termination of our primary noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, most of which was non-cash. The termination of this plan and the anticipated expense was previously communicated in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K. Now turning to our detailed margin results. Food and beverage costs were 20 basis points favorable to last year, as pricing of just over 2% and continued cost savings initiatives offset commodity inflation of approximately 1.7% and continued investments. Second quarter restaurant labor was unfavorable 10 basis points to last year. Total labor inflation of 4% was offset by pricing, check mix and productivity improvements in new and existing restaurants. We continue to manage labor well in this environment, given the heightened inflationary pressures we still face. Marketing expense was 30 basis points unfavorable to last year. Approximately 40% of this was related to LongHorn marketing and timing shift from the first to the second quarter, and the remainder was driven by increased media spending in our other segments, primarily Cheddar\u2019s. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin of 16.5% was 20 basis points lower than last year. General and administrative expense was 40 basis points better than last year, as we wrapped on higher incentive expense and sales leverage. Our second quarter effective tax rate of 5.9% was favorably impacted by the resolution of prior year\u2019s tax projects that were contemplated in our earlier guidance. Excluding these projects, our effective tax rate would have been closer to 11% for the quarter. All of this culminated in adjusted earnings after tax margin of 6.7%, 90 basis points higher than last year. Turning to our segment performance, Olive Garden grew sales and profit in the quarter driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin increased by 20 basis points by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing costs effectively. LongHorn also grew sales and segment profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. However, segment profit margin decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to the marketing timing shift I mentioned earlier, which increased marketing as a percent of sales in the quarter for LongHorn. In addition, LongHorn continued to have slightly elevated beef inflation, while making continued investments during the quarter. Fine Dining segment grew sales and profit in the quarter as well, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin decreased versus last year 10 basis points due to higher pre-opening expense and inefficiencies related to our four new restaurants opened year-to-date. Sales for our Other Business segment grew 3.5%, driven by net new restaurants. Both segment profit dollars and margin decreased this quarter due to incremental marketing expense, primarily at Cheddar\u2019s and margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales growth. As you saw in the press release this morning, we reiterated all aspects of our fiscal 2020 outlook. As we look forward to the second half of fiscal 2020, we feel confident in our ability to achieve same-restaurant sales between 1% to 2% for the year, resulting in adjusted diluted net earnings per share of between $6.30 and $6.45. Finally, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we will modify the reporting of same-restaurant sales to align with our four reportable business segments: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Fine Dining, and Other Business. This change will better align the current reporting of segment profits with reportable segment sales growth metrics. Before I close, I\u2019d like to wish all of our 185,000 team members, and each of you a safe and happy holiday season. And with that, we\u2019ll take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning, guy. My question is just on Olive Garden, the slowdown in comps in the quarter. It seems like you\u2019re saying this is mostly related to tough promotion, tough marketing comparisons early on in the quarter. Have you seen performance in the business improve enough to have the confidence to say that these issues are indeed transitory at Olive Garden and maybe even that they\u2019re behind you?\nGene Lee: Well, I think we are pretty clear on how sales performed throughout the quarter? We definitely had a tough wrap. And I think that we signaled that at the end of the first quarter that Lasagna Mia wasn\u2019t performing as well as we had hoped. We pulled the promotional advertising for that promotion, and we focused on the introduction of $5 take-homes. I did say -- as I stated, as we introduced Never Ending Pasta Bowl and had comparable marketing trends, trends improved throughout the quarter. And I would say, it\u2019s -- how we feel about the business is really in how we think about our guidance for the year. We\u2019ve come back out and reconfirmed our guidance. And we feel as though that that business continues to perform well, continues to take market share in the industry, and we\u2019re comfortable with where we\u2019re at.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nSara Senatore: I just wanted to ask sort of a bigger picture question about the brands. It sort of looks to me like your long LongHorn and Cheddar\u2019s -- you made investments behind marketing or value and you saw real improvement in the top-line. And I know you talked about the tough lapse from Olive Garden, but the fact that the margins were better sort of advances a different trade off. So, do you have an opportunity to push a little bit harder on value for Olive Garden, maybe to more level load it through the quarter? And when you think about how you value those trade-offs, so maybe lower margins but great comp set at LongHorn for example? How do you think about that trade-off generally and then perhaps with each of the brands? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes. That\u2019s a great question, Sara. We did know that LongHorn was performing really well throughout the quarter. And we made a decision not to push extra TRPs into Olive Garden to try to make up for the slow start we had in the quarter. We have levers to pull if we need to. We chose not to pull them and decided to let the quarter play out the way it did. And that\u2019s the beauty of the portfolio. We knew that we had really great strength in LongHorn and we didn\u2019t upped the marketing spend. We actually spent less money in advertising and marketing in the second quarter than we did the prior year. So, I think, that\u2019s -- we have to always pull back and say what\u2019s going on in the business. I do think as we do go forward, we will continue to look at how we use value in Olive Garden to drive same-restaurant sales, but also compete effectively against our competitors. And we\u2019ll have to continue to watch what our competitors are doing. And we\u2019ll have to match that intensity. Olive Garden is -- when you look at what Olive Garden\u2019s accomplished over the last four years, it\u2019s incredibly impressive. And we believe that it is positioned to continue to dominate in casual dining. And I believe we have more leverage than most to pull, to support that business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJohn Glass: If I could just follow-up on LongHorn. Maybe I missed just what the combination of things were that really drove that material acceleration. But can you just revisit that specifically? And it sounds like some incremental marketing or something changing the promotional environment and made some promotion with advertising environment. How sustainable is that or is that or is it you pull it forward such that you can\u2019t maybe replicate it in future quarters or is this a new run rate of advertising, promotional, so we should think about this as maybe you\u2019ve taken a permanent step up in that brand from a sales perspective?\nGene Lee: John, we had two extra weeks of media in the quarter, you saw that in the restaurant level expenses. I wouldn\u2019t give that a lot of the credence for the increase in same-restaurant sales. I think, as I said, the LongHorn team has been investing in this business for four years. Every state today is bigger or better than it was four years ago. They\u2019ve invested in the bread service, they\u2019ve invested in many other aspects of the overall operation. But, I think the most unique thing about LongHorn in this environment is that it is a smaller box with less employees than the average casual dining restaurant. Their ability to attract a top-quality employee, train them well and retain them, I believe enables them to execute at a higher level. And if I was to point to one thing that is driving that business, it\u2019s that single attribute right there. To answer your question, is this a sustainable trend? I don\u2019t know. All I know is this team has made -- has had a great discipline for four years, made a lot of really good investments, and I believe that they continue to do the right things every single day for their team members and their guests. And again, it\u2019s a unique operation because it\u2019s much smaller inside of smaller box and they deliver at a high level. And it all came together this quarter combined with a couple of extra weeks of media and they had a great quarter.\nJohn Glass: Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And Rick, just on the commodity front, specifically beef, I know you talked about where inflation is, and you\u2019ve given this in your coverage through at least May and thinking about low single digits. But, is anything changed on the margin, are you incrementally more concerned about particular proteins as you think about calendar 2020 in total? And there has obviously been a lot of noise and incremental discussion in the marketplace around ASF and how that may impact the protein pricing.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. John, we still feel comfortable of our guidance for total commodity inflation of 1% to 2%. We were a little higher -- at the higher end of that range of 1.7% this quarter. A couple of things on beef. We\u2019re really not seeing significant changes to what we thought would be in the beef market. The only thing we\u2019re seeing from ASF right now, as we said a couple of quarters ago, we only have about 2% of our pork -- of our buy as pork. But, there could be an impact, 18 months from now into overall proteins. We are seeing a little bit in ground beef right now but we\u2019re covered for the year on ground beef. So, we still feel really good about where we are. Chicken, we are starting to see a little bit of inflation, but we\u2019re again we\u2019re covered for that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. I\u2019m wondering just related to sort of the strategy on advertising and media heading into the election year. Normally, we media costs increase. And just wondering, Gene, how the brands are planning to manage through that type of environment, and if you expect any differences there?\nGene Lee: Yes. Great question, David. I think, we\u2019ll continue to focus on non-working media spend to see how much we can pull that down to help offset the inflation. But, we will try to spend from media standpoint at the same levels without increasing the overall spend for the brand. Now, I think,, as you know, as you get around the elections, especially when you\u2019re doing a lot of national stuff and some spot television, you can get bumped. And try and make sure that we get our full complement of advertising as we move into the last six months prior to election, depending on the marketplace will be a challenge. We\u2019ll try to work around that. We\u2019ve got other levers that we can pull, social, we got TDIs, we\u2019ve got some other things that we can do to help offset that if we\u2019re not getting our full complement of advertising. But, we\u2019ll continue to work and focus on making sure we\u2019re as lean as we possibly can be on our non-working, so that we can maybe shift a little bit more of that into working to offset the inflation.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. And then, Rick, just a quick one on the margins. I think, there has been several quarters in a row of productivity and mix cited as a pretty nice offset to the labor inflation you are seeing. I\u2019m just wondering what the sustainability of that looks like, and whether you\u2019re starting to lap that at any point in the next few quarters?\nRick Cardenas: A couple of things. One, we\u2019ve said quite a few times that we don\u2019t expect to have labor below last year for quite a while as we keep inflation. And so, this quarter played out, we\u2019re about 10 basis points lower than last year in labor. The productivity, if you remember, a lot of that started with new restaurants last year around the third quarter and we started to see a little bit of an increase in productivity from new restaurants. That should start lapping itself. So, we still feel pretty good about managing our labor well the way -- based on inflation, what\u2019s going on now. And we\u2019ve all contemplated that in our guidance of 1% to 2% total inflation.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: I\u2019m sorry. 2.5% total inflation.\nDavid Tarantino: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJeff Bernstein: Two questions as well. First one, Gene, you mentioned watching your competitors closely. I\u2019m just wondering in that vein, as you think about casual dining broadly, do you think maybe you\u2019re seeing an increased promotional activity and maybe that would change your marketing approach in the back half of your fiscal \u201820, whether it\u2019s in response to what competitors are doing or whether you feel the need to be a leader in terms of being more promotional or a change in your promotional cadence? Any thoughts on the industry broadly would be great.\nGene Lee: Yes. I think, what we\u2019re seeing in the industry is that there is more pressure on some promotional constructs that have now become permanent parts of menus. You\u2019ve got a big competitor out there that\u2019s stated they\u2019re going to be continue to be very, very aggressive. But, I continue to look at -- when I look at Knapp and Black Box, I continue to look at the check average is growing north of 2.5%. So, the consumer is still paying 2.5% or plus more. So, I think that you\u2019ve got to -- we\u2019ve got to stay on top of what\u2019s happening in the industry. We need to make sure that we\u2019re offering value in our large brands across the platform. So, some value in price, some value in portion, as we try to attract and talk to each and all the different constituents that we have for consumers. I would say that Olive Garden is the value leader and that we need to stay focused on that in making sure that we have the appropriate price point for all the consumers that want to use Olive Garden. And I think that we have the ability to lead in that, not just follow.\nJeff Bernstein: Got it. And my follow-up was just as we think about the fiscal \u201820 outlook. Rick, you mentioned guidance unchanged and that\u2019s now the first two quarters of this year. And it seems like it\u2019s contrary to past practice of thinking of Darden as guiding conservatively and more of not beating and raising. So, I\u2019m just wondering if maybe you enter this year guiding more aggressively for the year or maybe fundamentals have eased relative to your expectation a little bit. I\u2019m just wondering if maybe you\u2019re a little bit more cautious as we move through or into the back half of the fiscal year, what might have changed relative to historical practice of being able to beat the conservative start to the year guidance.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Jeff, every year at the beginning of the year when we guide, we guide what we think is appropriate and we adjust as things play out. And things have been playing out exactly as we thought, which is why we haven\u2019t changed our guide. In the past, things have been a little bit better than what we thought in the beginning of the year. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve adjusted up. But, I wouldn\u2019t say that we were more aggressive in this year\u2019s guide than we have in the past. We used the same philosophy that we always have. It just happens that the first quarter and the second quarter didn\u2019t outperform what we thought as much as it has in the prior year. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t raise our performance. And we still have, coming into the back half of this fiscal year, chances of weather, chances of election and everything else is going on in talking about consumers having other things to think about. So, again, we didn\u2019t change anything the way we\u2019ve done things in the past, and we feel pretty good about where our guide is right now.\nJeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carril from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nChris Carril: So, I\u2019m curious to hear your current thinking on the off-premise opportunity, and in particular how the performance of the $5 take-home offer and the sequential acceleration in off-premise growth may impact your thought process on off-premise strategy today? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Yes. I think that $5 take-home has been a great addition to the off-premise menu for Olive Garden. It\u2019s been well received from -- by consumers, will continue to evolve that platform over time. We think this continues to upside there. As we focus on off-premise, our biggest initiative is to improve the convenience for our consumer. We go back to -- we know the two most important things are on time and accurate. And as we continue to grow this business, we focus on those two things with the addition of ensuring that we have the right capabilities in each one of our restaurants. We\u2019re investing capital dollars into our restaurants to ensure that we have the space and the right equipment to handle the additional demand. And that\u2019s a big -- that will be a big effort over the next 12 to 18 months. And we think that we can take a little more friction out for the consumer. This is a very highly rated experience for our consumer, and we\u2019ll continue to focus on executing at a high level. As long as the consumer demand is still there, we think there is opportunity to grow this space. And I\u2019m really excited about what we\u2019re doing. But, more importantly what excites me about what we\u2019re doing from an off-premise standpoint is the quality of the experience and the quality of the product that\u2019s leaving our restaurant. And, I believe that\u2019s why our business continues to grow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nWill Slabaugh: I had a question on Cheddar\u2019s. I know you\u2019re not where you want to be quite yet, but it was a nice improvement from what we\u2019ve seen. And you mentioned some improved turnover in customer metrics that -- but there were something else. I was wondering if you might point to in the quarter that helped improve the two-year trend I think well over 400 basis points. I would love to hear your thoughts there.\nGene Lee: Yes. Bottom line is that we\u2019re operating better. We\u2019ve got more stability. I\u2019m starting to see a culture develop inside of Cheddar\u2019s for the first time, one culture. Right? So, you go back to when we did the acquisition, we had these three distinct cultures. And for the first time, I\u2019m feeling like we\u2019re Cheddar\u2019s of one. And I\u2019ve said all along, this is not a brand issue, this is an operations issue. And I think our teams are making significant progress. And we\u2019ve got stability in a lot of places for the first time. And again, this is the beginning of a journey. But, you look at the power of LongHorn. We have the stability and what we\u2019re able to accomplish. Gaining 20 points a reduction in our employee turnover is huge. And I think we can do -- I think we can continue to do that again. And so, that\u2019s really what\u2019s got me excited. I think, we\u2019re just doing a better job. I had lunch in Cheddar\u2019s this week. It was fantastic. It was the best experience I\u2019ve ever had in the Cheddar\u2019s. And so, I mean, that\u2019s why I think we\u2019re starting to make improvement. It is still -- as I said, there is still pockets in the Company where we don\u2019t have that stability yet, we don\u2019t have that tenure, and we haven\u2019t developed that culture, but we\u2019re on a much better path.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGregory Francfort: I just had two. The first one was on, Gene, I think you mentioned turnover at LongHorn. Can you maybe frame that up versus either the industry or versus maybe its historical levels? Is it down, is it just maybe up less than the industry? I guess, what was the commentary meant to suggest? And then, the other question I had was on off-premise. It\u2019s been I think a couple of years since, Gene, you\u2019ve given some thoughts on the competitive push into off-premise. And, I think, a few of your competitors have gone into third-party partnerships. They\u2019ve grabbed a few points of sales, but the profitably is becoming more of a focus. Can you maybe give where your updated thoughts are on third-party delivery, particularly small order? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Sure. When I think of LongHorn, I would just say the management turnover is sub-15%, and it\u2019s less than 10% at the managing partner level, which is very, very important. And I think, compared to industry of mid-30s. I mean, we\u2019re -- that\u2019s just -- it\u2019s industry leading, it\u2019s leading inside of Darden. We have tremendous tenure there and most importantly, we have tremendous pride in that business. And so, that\u2019s a big thing. Employee turnover is in the low 60s. That\u2019s looking much more like one of our upscale businesses. And so, you can do so many different things. Think about the lack of training costs that we have in that business and the rest of our businesses, because we\u2019re so far below the industry, but especially that one there. And I think that really leads to great operations. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s been driving. On off-premise, our position hasn\u2019t changed on off-premise with the last mile delivery. We believe today -- we want to control the experience. We do have off-premise last mile delivery in Olive Garden. Again I\u2019ll remind everybody $75 -- above $75, and if you let us -- if you call it in before 5 o\u2019clock, the night before, we will deliver. That\u2019s a big business. It\u2019s a growing business for us. We\u2019ve got an average check in the 300s. That\u2019s business that\u2019s really worth chasing and doing. So, we\u2019re in it in our own way. But, as I think -- as we think about it as a team, we really like controlling that experience. And we get back to those two most -- those two critical aspects the consumer is looking for, on-time and accurate. And we control those when we control the overall experience. So, our position on the last mile delivery companies has not changed.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead.\nDennis Geiger: Gene, I just wanted to ask a bit more about Olive Garden looking ahead. Good to hear that the trend\u2019s accelerated through the quarter, but just wondering if you could talk a bit more about contributions from key drivers going forward to continue to support this outperformance. You talked quite a bit about off-premise. Is there anything more kind of on the strength of the operational execution, how impactful that can continue to be? The lunch gains you mentioned thinking ahead, promotional dry powder, maybe your thoughts on the innovation pipeline, and just kind of anything else to kind of continue to support the outperformance that you\u2019ve seen for quite some time now? Thanks.\nGene Lee: I think, off-premise will continue to be a driver. I think, the $5 take-home platform will continue to be a strong driver. There\u2019s a lot of innovation that we can still do in that platform. I think that we\u2019ve got other platforms out there that will continue to strengthen whether it\u2019s Buy One Take One, Never Ending Pasta Bowl. I think that the promotional pipeline continues to be strong. And I think that I want to pivot back to -- I think, this is an important time that we focus on running great restaurant, and staffing is the most critical thing that we face today in this employment environment. And so, we need to make sure that our Olive Gardens remain staffed with great people. We need to continue to focus on improving our employment proposition. These are high-volume restaurants. And I think that we win if we have the best people inside the box. I\u2019m comfortable with our ability to create a strategy to continue the momentum, and I think there are drivers out there.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Levy from MKM Partners. Please go ahead.\nBrett Levy: Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. First, I guess, can you share a little bit more on the granularity of the calendar shift? Was that 100 basis points largely split evenly or was that -- did you see any major shift among brands? And then, also, did you see anything within the regionality? And then, I know you don\u2019t like to give intra-quarter type updates and I know you talked about how you had a softer start to the quarter but strengthened throughout. Is it possible to quantify what the market share gains were versus on the GAAP later in the quarter versus earlier? And then, finally, is there anything that you saw fundamentally operationally at Olive Garden from a score relation, guest satisfaction, quantifying the turnover that can help substantiate and support just the dominant position that the brand is generally in? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Brett. It\u2019s Rick. In regards to the calendar shift -- lot of questions there, but, in regards to the calendar shift, they impacted -- it impacted brand differently. So, the casual brands were impacted favorably in general and the finer dining brands were impacted unfavorably in general, and each brand was impacted a little differently. Within the casual brands, Cheddar\u2019s having the smallest positive impact. The regionality of that really wasn\u2019t that different. So, it\u2019s basically -- Thanksgiving shift was no different in one region than another. The only regionality would be whether. And market share gap for the quarter by month, we don\u2019t really want to get into the change in share gap by months, other than what Gene said about Olive Garden being negative in the first month and having to dig out of that a little bit to get to be positive for the quarter. And then, on operating metrics for Olive Garden specifically, their operating metrics are at all time highs. So, there guest satisfaction, a lot of their different metrics operationally are all-time highs and they were at all-time highs for every month of the quarter. So, hopefully that answers those questions. But, thanks Brett.\nBrett Levy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nNicole Miller: Thank you. Good morning. There is a lot of discussion around value proposition in Olive Garden. I\u2019m wondering when you do see the value proposition and how you look at your lens, your perspective move one way or another in the dining rooms. Does that show up in a demographic shift? Does every demographic want or seek value in the same way, or do you see some more or less sensitive to value?\nGene Lee: Well, I think that -- Nicole, it\u2019s an interesting question. I think that for some of our consumer -- because it\u2019s such a broad audience, some of our consumer values a lot more about what they pay from a dollar standpoint, and they are looking for that entry level price point. For some of our consumers, value is more about portion size compared to price. And so, we try to find value for everybody a little bit differently. And I think you have to -- a brand that has such broad appeal, you have to have value and everything as just which part is important, the numerator, the denominator. We know that there is a guest base inside of Olive Garden that play -- that price plays a very important part of their decision making. And we have to have an offer out there a lot of the time, so that they will come to us. If they don\u2019t have an offer, they will go someplace else. We know that through our token analysis. But, we also know that there are folks out there that look at value on say chicken Alfredo. When we increased the size of the portion of chicken, the value scores went way up, and that was very important to them. But, that\u2019s on an entry level price point in Olive Garden. And so, we\u2019ve got to think across a broad spectrum and define value different for each opportunity. But, we have to have something for that consumer that is very deal oriented. And we know we have to have that out -- have to have something out there most of the time.\nNicole Miller: That\u2019s very helpful. And I was thinking about it in that kind of bigger, better, looking forward context of how do millennials seek value. So, I think, if you could remind us the prime casual diner Olive Garden years around the 30 years old age and the millennial population is getting ready to peak in size of being in that age as a demographic cohort. Is it too early for Olive Garden to be thinking about how to benefit from that or will they just actually naturally benefit from that change?\nGene Lee: Yes. I mean, the prim demographic is 35 to 55 for Olive Garden. And we\u2019ve talked about the fact that population for the prime dining out years is going to start to grow and continue to grow for a while. I would say, when we think about millennials, I think the one thing that millennials of all socioeconomic background like to do is have a lot of choice. They like to build their own meal. That\u2019s why Cucina Mia has worked so well for that cohort. But, I would tell you that millennials that have lower incomes are looking for value, just the way other groups look for value at that point in time. And I think, we have to be careful with gross generalizations of this cohort as they transition into the next phase of their life. We over-index with millennials. This is a very millennial friendly brand. It is a very social brand. And I would tell you that millennials love the value of Olive Garden because they can stretch their dollars.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Dan on for Andrew today. We saw sort of mixed performance across some of the polished casual where trends have been a bit more challenged recently. You talked about some of the incremental marketing spend at Cheddar\u2019s and LongHorn, but I know last quarter you also spoke about potentially adding some marketing spend around some of those smaller portfolio brands as well. So, did you end up doing that? And if you did, can you just kind of give us an update on how those initiatives are performing and how you think it will work, given the lack of national scale?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think, the brand that we made the most progress in was a Yard House. And the Yard House was positive before the Thanksgiving shift. So, we are very pleased to see that. And so, we\u2019ll continue to find ways to try to use digital to promote these brands. We\u2019re doing a lot of test and learn in those brands also to try to be effective. We\u2019re trying to make -- we\u2019re making progress in all of those brands. I would say that Seasons, as Rick alluded to, Seasons was the most impacted by the holiday switch. I think, we\u2019re making progress in that business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris O\u2019Cull from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Gene, I know the Company had indicated Cheddar\u2019s would be testing some of these various marketing initiatives. But, did these tests have a material impact on the comp performance during the quarter? And, when do you think we could see some of these tests being implemented more broadly?\nGene Lee: I think they had -- I don\u2019t know if they had a meaningful impact. I mean, they had some sort of impact on the quarter. I would tell you that this -- we\u2019re testing some of this activity on a very small scale, trying to get an understanding of what can move the needle. I would say that this is an evolution. I think that we need to continue to use a new store development backfill strategy, so that we can become more efficient in some more markets to really make some of this stuff pay out a little bit more positively. So, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t give you a time to say, hey, this is when we think we\u2019re going to have this all figured out. I would also add that in the digital world today, it is very, very dynamic. And I think test and learn and digital is going to be something that companies are going to be doing forever, because there continues to be new avenues and new channels in which you can get to your consumer, and that audience is very fickle today compared to what it used to be with spot TV. So, I think test and learn is going to be part of our vernacular for a long time.\nChris O\u2019Cull: And then, I know you mentioned Olive Garden\u2019s comps improved during the quarter, but I\u2019m curious whether the check benefit from the $5 take-home was somewhat negated by the Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion?\nRick Cardenas: Chris, this is Rick. The check benefit from the $5 take-home was not negated by the NEPB, Never Ending Pasta Bowl. It was really the lunch investment that we made earlier in the fiscal year that drove our check down. If you think about Olive Garden check, Olive Garden\u2019s check grew by 2.7% for the quarter. 2% of that was pricing, about 80 basis points was catering, and everything else washed. So, if you think about the 80 basis points of catering, you can think about that, like guest counts, since we don\u2019t talk about -- we don\u2019t give them credit for guests. But, to answer your question, no, $5 take-home was not offset by NEPB.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nPeter Saleh: I just wanted to come back to the conversation I think we had several quarters ago on loyalty. I think, you guys had loyalty test in place for over a year in maybe about 10% of your stores. Where do you guys stand on the loyalty test? Is that something you plan to forward with or just an update on loyalty would be great.\nGene Lee: We\u2019re still testing. There\u2019s really no further update. We continue to analyze the results. But, at this point in time, we\u2019re just in the same 10%, and we\u2019ll continue to watch how that\u2019s maturing.\nPeter Saleh: Is there anything you\u2019re looking for in particular before you decide whether to just scrap it all together or move forward?\nGene Lee: I think that we want to continue to see if there is something there. I mean, we\u2019re trying to value the first party -- what\u2019s the first party data worth to us and how much can we move sales with the loyalty program. We\u2019re trying to get that read. And again these are -- this is a very, very, very big decision and one that\u2019s very difficult to undo. And so, we have to have a high confidence level that this is the correct path to go down. And at this point we\u2019re not at that level yet.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.\nJeff Farmer: On the June earnings call, I believe you commented that your concepts were seeing some, I think you described it as day-to-day and week-to-week sales volatility. I\u2019m just curious if that volatility has continued. And if it has, what that might signal about the consumer and their demand for casual dining more broadly?\nGene Lee: Yes. I mean, I think it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve had some huge calendar swings. So, I think the volatility on a comparative basis is still there. I think the environment is a little bit better than it has been in a while. I think that employment is still strong, confidence is rebounding. I think, the near-term risk of a recession has receded. So, I feel pretty good about the overall environment right now. And I don\u2019t think that us as a team, we get too worried about day-to-day, week-to-week and volatility. I mean, it\u2019s still there. There\u2019s volatility around what your competitors are doing and what we\u2019re doing. And we\u2019re not -- we\u2019re cognizant of trying to match promotional weeks, but we\u2019ve had much -- we\u2019ve been much more willing to make longer term decisions and let there be a little bit of volatility week-to-week with our marketing activities. So, it\u2019s made -- something that makes a little harder to read in the short-term. In the long-term, it all works out.\nJeff Farmer: And then, just as a follow-up to that in terms of some of the volatility that you\u2019ve seen with the consumer demand side, despite incredibly strong consumer metrics that sort of break down in that very strong relationship historically, meaning if you saw a good consumer trends, good consumer health metrics, you typically saw a pretty nice casual dining same-store sales. You guys pointed out that that had softened up a little bit. Any further comment on that?\nGene Lee: I think it\u2019s -- might I have a real brief comment on that. This marketplace is going to be defined by winners and losers. If you have a strong value proposition and you\u2019re executing at a high level, and that execution is going to be driven by your employment proposition. In this environment attracting, retaining great employees has never been more difficult. And those that can do that with a strong value proposition are going to win.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Katherine Fogertey from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKatherine Fogertey: Great. Thank you. I wanted to touch a little bit on the off-premise at Olive Garden. You talked about overall sales starting the quarter pretty soft and then improving. Did you see similar trends in off-premise, especially kind of when you take away the $5 take-home side of the business and kind of focus on the traffic that you\u2019re seeing from people placing orders 5:00 pm, ahead of time, $75 and higher threshold. Did you see softness there in the beginning of the quarter and that improve or was that business behaving differently?\nGene Lee: Again, a little too granular there, all I would say is that our delivery program continues to grow at a good pace. And when we\u2019re doing Never Ending Pasta Bowl, that\u2019s not a great time, I mean it\u2019s not one of our best periods for off-premise comp. It\u2019s just not a promotional item that lends itself to that. But overall, I would just say that, $5 take-home was a big piece of what we have for a new offering. It got people excited. But, our overall off-premise business continues to grow with consumer demand. And I\u2019m not going to get into a much more detail than that.\nKatherine Fogertey: Okay. Thank you. And then, you gave some good color around the 100 basis-point benefit from the Thanksgiving shift by some brands. But curious if you would help us understand a little bit more, was it Olive Garden that benefited more than LongHorn or was that benefit kind of equally split?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Katy. This is Rick. The Olive Garden, LongHorn were pretty similar in benefit for the Thanksgiving shift.\nKatherine Fogertey: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJohn Ivankoe: I heard your comments that you made on obviously some of the upscale brands actually being hurt by Thanksgiving. But, could you talk about, are there any other common themes in upscale that are kind of noteworthy at this point? And I guess, Gene, would you expect the upscale brands to actually be performing better today for where we are in the economic cycle and where we are in the stock market, for example? And is there anything Darden can do, self help to improve those?\nGene Lee: Yes. I mean, Thanksgiving has turned into one of the biggest days in upscale, and they didn\u2019t have that in the second quarter. So, I think that -- I think these upscale brands are performing really well. I mean, we have two of the best upscale brands out there today, very high volume with Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s, and they continue to perform at high level. So, I\u2019m excited about what they have going forward. As I\u2019ve said before, I think their books look good through the holidays. These are exciting businesses and I\u2019m very pleased with their overall performance.\nJohn Ivankoe: And I may have missed the number. How big the calendar shift actually was there in the second quarter? And could you also comment on some of the brands between Olive Garden and LongHorn and the two Fine Dining brands?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, John. It\u2019s Rick. The calendar shift for Darden was 100 basis points favorable. As I said on the call, the casual brands were benefited by that and the upscale Fine Dining brands were hurt. And the upscale Fine Dining brands were hurt more than the casual dining brands were helped, but the casual dining brands are bigger. That\u2019s why we\u2019re at about 100 basis points.\nJohn Ivankoe: Okay. All right, understood. Thank you for that. And then, the brands in the middle?\nRick Cardenas: There weren\u2019t really many brands in the middle. We\u2019ve pretty much had casual. I also mentioned that Cheddar\u2019s was the least benefited of the casual brands. And again, everything that\u2019s Fine Dining that takes reservations was hurt.\nJohn Ivankoe: Okay. Thank you for that. But also, like when we talk about Yard House, for example, we talked about Bahama Breeze, even Seasons 52, I mean, again, these are higher ticket brands than Olive Garden and LongHorn. One might -- you actually expect that the consumer would trade up to those brands in the current economic environment, current stock market. Is there anything as you kind of look at what Darden can do on the self-help basis to kind of improve those businesses? Is there anything that we should be considering? Obviously, the brand in itself is that big but together, certainly they are.\nGene Lee: Yes. John, I think that we\u2019ve talked about in the past. I think that these brands are in some of the best retail trade areas in the United States. They continue to face competitive intrusion. And you have to fight that competitive intrusion off. They are small enough for a one or two restaurants being down a significant number. It can have an impact on the overall business. As I said, I\u2019m pleased with the trends in Yard House. Seasons, we\u2019re making progress in Seasons. We\u2019ve been able to pull out of a lot of the discounting that was happening in that business, which we believe was a good long-term decision that\u2019s put -- that\u2019s had an impact on the headline number. Bahama Breeze, we\u2019ve had some competitive intrusion. We\u2019ve also cannibalized ourselves in our biggest market Orlando, opening up a couple of restaurants that have had an impact on the overall system. And we know this market well. Those are places where we want to have restaurants. But, right now, there has been some cannibalization. I don\u2019t really pay a whole lot of attention to some of those top line numbers. I pay a lot of attention to the individual restaurants in each group and I understand how they\u2019re performing. These are well-positioned brands that continue to perform well. But, they are in the best trade areas in America and they\u2019re facing competition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. Just a little bit of a different track here. I guess, on growth, a lot of people always look at sort of the smaller brands, Cheddar\u2019s and others to be the growth vehicle, but LongHorn\u2019s one that really -- you\u2019ve done a tremendous turnaround on the margin side. ROE positioned for a little bit better growth ahead. I think, you\u2019re maybe eight net stores you\u2019ve added over the last 12 months, seems a little low. You\u2019re only in about 13 or 14 states. So, there\u2019s certainly a lot more room for growth. I\u2019m just curious, what has been the governor to that. Why can\u2019t that brand go back to its growth year days and could that be on the cusp ahead?\nGene Lee: Well, I think that there is a growth opportunity with LongHorn. I mean, we\u2019re concentrating on entering new territory slowly and we\u2019re focused on trying to backfill where we have opportunities. We think the governor to growth is the human capital. This is a brand that is very important how we develop our culture and how we run it. But, we are on a path to do 15 to 20 this year, which is a pretty good number. We haven\u2019t opened up any LongHorns in California. That\u2019s really the last big territory available to us. We are going to open up a restaurant this spring in California to see how the brand is received. We\u2019ll open a few more and will support that. But, we\u2019re very-pleased with this. And I love the controlled growth, because to me that\u2019s where -- we\u2019re in 43 states. So, I don\u2019t know where you got your number from\u2026\nMatt DiFrisco: I\u2019m sorry...\nGene Lee: LongHorn is in 43 states today, over 500 units, closing on $2 billion brand. We\u2019re going to continue to grow this. This brand has growth opportunity. We\u2019re going to grow it responsibly.\nMatt DiFrisco: Sorry about that. I was saying you have an average of 13 in a state. That\u2019s what I was saying. Just also I guess, we\u2019ve been checking a lot. And a lot of these smaller brands have been closing down. Is there that opportunity when you look at where you would grow LongHorn? Does it have to be necessarily a new site or are there opportunities, maybe more in this economic cycle where you could sort of take over an existing restaurant that just won\u2019t belly up and it\u2019s sitting next to a couple of Olive Gardens or in a market with a couple of Olive Gardens where you can get some synergies?\nGene Lee: We look at every real estate opportunities, what is the best way? If the building has a good enough structure, we will do a rehab. We\u2019ve done a few of those. If we don\u2019t believe the building has the structure to really be a good place for a LongHorn over 30 years, then we\u2019ll blow it -- we\u2019ll tear it down. But, each individual site is evaluated through an economic lens and say, which is the best economic outcome for the investment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Anderson from Maxim Group. Please go ahead.\nStephen Anderson: I wanted to follow up with you on the off-premise opportunity and specifically at Cheddar\u2019s seeing that you\u2019ve built out a good infrastructure over at Olive Garden and at LongHorn, just wanted to see what your thoughts are. As soon as you build out your marketing capabilities at Cheddar\u2019s, what role off-premise will play and online mobile ordering will play there?\nGene Lee: Yes. Stephen, good question. We have not had any emphasis on improving our off-premise sales in Cheddar\u2019s. We believe this to be a big opportunity, and it\u2019s an opportunity that we will tackle over the next 6 to 18 months. We need to go back and we need to develop good processes, understand what the -- develop good capabilities, implement online ordering, which is not accessible today, all those things are growth opportunity. And it all will be sequenced in when we believe we have the right operational capabilities to handle it. But you have identified a future growth vehicle for Cheddar\u2019s.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jake Bartlett from SunTrust. Please go ahead.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Gene, it was the second quarter of last year that you talked about more explicitly about pulling back on incentives that the consumer was strong enough. You wanted to kind of have that in your pocket if the economy got worse. Where do you stand on incentives? Have you kicked that up since the second quarter of last year? How do you think your approach on incentives for consumers is going to be going forward this year?\nGene Lee: Yes. I believe that you\u2019ll see us use that lever appropriately. We have been in the marketplace testing some new offers with some relatively short expiration time to see how they -- how the consumer reacts to them. It is just one piece of our overall tool kit to drive the business. Now we -- again, we have identified as we pulled out and slowed down our TDIs over last year, there is a consumer out there that will only visit our restaurants when we have an incentive out there. So, we need -- we\u2019ve learned that we need to have something out there for this consumer. And we\u2019ll continue to -- we talk about one of our focuses, when we talk about back to basics is our integrated marketing approach. And this is part of our integrated marketing approach is how do we use TDIs, how do we use other discounts or incentives and combined with what we\u2019re doing on a promotional level too. We always think about those in unison. So, it is not a lever that we can pull. I will say for those that do look at our frequency, I would urge you not to look at that in isolation, because there are other parts of our media spend that have a lot more impact than our TDI spend, primarily how many total rating points we have in the marketplace.\nJake Bartlett: Great. And then, second question is on acquisitions. And one is, just if you could talk about your appetite for kind of continuing acquisitions? It\u2019s been I guess almost two years since acquiring Cheddar\u2019s, but also the environment, whether you\u2019re seeing some smaller chains kind of under more pressure, given the kind of scale benefits with technology and with some inflation that\u2019s going on. So, one, your appetite and the second kind of the environment for acquisitions out there that you\u2019re seeing.\nGene Lee: Yes. I\u2019m going to probably dodge that a little bit and give you the standard answer that we\u2019ll continue to evaluate our current portfolio and evaluate the opportunities to add to the portfolio. As you know we\u2019re -- we continue to look at the opportunities out there, we continue to look at the opportunities internally, and we\u2019ll continue to have those discussions with our management team and our Board. And while we\u2019re doing that, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on running the great brands that we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Tower from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJon Tower: Thanks and happy holidays. Just a quick one for me. So, based on work, it looks like your off-premise business in Olive Garden was greater than 100% of the comp growth in the period. And I believe that off-premise offers, like catering and $5 take-homes only show up in the mix and not traffic. And I think Rick, you hit on it earlier that lunch might have drove down mix a little bit in the period. But, I am curious if you could expand upon the thought that -- maybe these to-go businesses are cannibalizing potential future visits, or maybe you can give us some comfort that it isn\u2019t happening in the market.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. I don\u2019t think -- we don\u2019t believe that they\u2019re cannibalizing future visits. I mean, obviously, I think the people make a choice, am I going to eat in or you out tonight, and we want to be in both those decision sets. I go back inside the quarter and say we started off, we had a great promotion last year with Buy One Take One and we had a promotion that was weaker. I think, it\u2019s important that -- we\u2019re sitting here today admitting that we didn\u2019t hit the mark on Lasagna Mia and we pulled off the promotional advertising to support that. Not everything that we\u2019re going to do is going to work, but you got to -- we recognize that this wasn\u2019t -- something wasn\u2019t right with it and we didn\u2019t put the promotional dollars behind it, and we pivoted. And I think that that put us in a hole in the quarter, and we decided to let it play out. And that\u2019s primarily because we had LongHorn doing well. So, I don\u2019t -- I think that -- I look at it is all one big pool. And we\u2019ve been saying it for you, we\u2019re going to try to feed people Olive Garden where and when they want it. And I think that we\u2019re doing a great job with that. And I\u2019m excited about what we\u2019ve done at launch. We\u2019ve definitely improved that trend. We\u2019re competing more effectively. And I believe into the future, we\u2019ll have to make strategic adjustments to compete more effectively at dinner too. You\u2019re constantly evolving in this business, you\u2019re not staying still. And so, I\u2019m confident in our team, I\u2019m confident in our insights, and all I want to do is sell Olive Garden food to some \u2013 anybody that wants and anywhere they want it.\nJon Tower: And then, just following up on the promotional miss hit or hit and miss in this quarter. Was there anything different about the testing process on this promotion relative to past testing that might have altered the go-to-market or seen -- or what really played out in the market versus what you guys were seeing in test?\nGene Lee: No. I think that anytime you -- testing environment is small and it\u2019s always different than a macro test. So, we\u2019re not sure what else was going on. We made the decision. I think in hindsight we may have made that decision too quickly and didn\u2019t give a chance to play out. But, we did what we thought was right -- right, wrong or indifferent. We made a pivot, and it\u2019s behind us and now we\u2019re moving on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nBrian Vaccaro: Thanks. Hey. Good morning. Just two quick ones for me. Could we circle back on the Olive Garden incentives in the quarter? And if you look across all marketing channels, how do the mix of value and incentives compare year-on-year?\nRick Cardenas: We were definitely out there with a lot more incentives, and that was part of we need to be out there because we pulled back on the advertising spend. So, it\u2019s just -- again, it\u2019s a small channel in which we play in, but we definitely increased and we also were out there doing a ton of testing. So, test and learn just doesn\u2019t apply to our smaller brands. It was test and learn inside of Olive Garden, probably the most test, trying to understand which TDIs would resonate with consumers, how long of time that they need to put on those to activate the consumer. So, we were definitely in the marketplace and it\u2019s a great way for us to talk to our E-club members. So, again, I just think it\u2019s a risk for you to look at all of that in isolation because the media spend was down significantly and we were testing and learning in this channel.\nBrian Vaccaro: And shifting gears to LongHorn. Obviously, a pretty sharp sequential acceleration that you saw, and I know you talked about a few different factors. But, could you possibly rank order to the factors that drove that acceleration in your view? And then, maybe just a little more color on how you drove that improved throughput during the busiest weekend hours that you referenced? Thank you.\nGene Lee: I\u2019ll answer them backwards. I think it\u2019s just focus. I think, we\u2019re focusing on those busiest hours, we\u2019re asking for our top management person in the restaurant to be at the front door to help with that process. It\u2019s like anything else in our business. When we focus on something, we get it. And management team, they\u2019ve done a great job of focusing on that. I think, the beauty of the LongHorn quarter is I can\u2019t point -- I\u2019m not going to point to anything in specific. I believe this is a quarter where four years of investment, a couple of extra weeks of really, really good advertising that\u2019s resonated with the consumer, great stability in the leadership roles in the restaurants, all came together and we had a great quarter. Anybody that tries to isolate and to point to one thing other than a one-time promotion, I believe it\u2019s very hard -- very difficult to do. And I just think everything came together for LongHorn, great quarter, great job to the team. Anybody that\u2019s out there listening, you guys did a great job.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back to Kevin Kalicak for closing remarks.\nKevin Kalicak: Thanks, Carol. That concludes our call for today. I\u2019d like to remind you that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday, March 19th, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today\u2019s call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gene Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we had a good quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.06 billion, an increase of 4.2%, same-restaurant sales increased 2% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.12. Looking at the industry overall. We continue to see that consumers are willing to visit brands with compelling value and strong in-restaurant execution. That's why we remain relentlessly focused on executing our back to basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere and supported with integrated marketing that resonates with our guests. We also continue to strengthen and leverage our four competitive advantages. One of those advantages is our results-oriented culture. Admits record low unemployment, I am proud to see our retention rates continue to improve. We have a compelling employment proposition and our ability to retain and staff our restaurants with the right people is an important driver of our success. Turning to brand highlights for the quarter. Olive Garden delivered its 21st consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 2.6%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 1.5% and 1.1% growth from new restaurants. Olive Garden outperformed the industry benchmark in same-restaurant sales and traffic by 120 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. As a reminder, Olive Garden had a difficult promotional ramp to start the quarter with Lasagna Mia comping over Buy One Take One for the first four weeks. Additionally, we made some changes to our promotional messaging and we reduced marketing spending. As a result, we had to make up some ground from negative same-restaurant sales at the beginning of the quarter. Sales trends improved as we moved into Never Ending Pasta Bowl with more comparable marketing spend. The Olive Garden team continues to focus on operational execution, convenience and everyday value. Delivering exceptional guest experiences remain a key priority for the restaurant teams. Olive Garden also continued to meet their guest need for convenience as off-premise sales grew 17% during the quarter, driven by strong preference for the $5 take-home offer. For the quarter off-premise sales represented 17% of total sales. Digital sales grew approximately 33% and represented 38% of total to go sales. Finally, as we noted last quarter, Olive Garden introduced a new weekday lunch menu with 21 options under $10 to strengthen everyday value. This platform continues to perform well and has seen meaningful improvements in lunch sales trends. Overall, I'm pleased with Olive Garden's performance. They have the right strategy in place, and I'm confident that they will continue to make the appropriate investments and execute at a high level, which will enable them to continue to grow market share. LongHorn Steakhouse had an outstanding quarter. Total sales grew 8.4%, driven by 1.7% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 6.7%, the brand's 27th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth. LongHorn outperformed the industry benchmark in same-restaurant sales and traffic by 640 basis points and 550 basis points, respectively. LongHorn's performance is a result of the adhering to their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement. Over the last four years, the team has made significant investments in the strategy and those investments continue to pay off. During the quarter, they introduced several enhancements to existing core menu items to further strengthen the quality of their food and beverage. And in order to tell their quality story more effectively, LongHorn team evolved their award-winning You Can't Fake Steak advertising campaign to better communicate their expertise and showcase their high quality stakes. The overall LongHorn experience is a key differentiator and their distinctive, relevant advertising continues to resonate with guests. LongHorn was designed as a very simple business and the operations team has done excellent job of finding opportunities to simplify to drive execution. During the quarter, they implemented a number of ideas that would result a direct feedback from restaurant teams. Additionally, our renewed focus on execution standards led to improved throughput during the busiest weekend hours this quarter. And finally, LongHorn continues to leverage the biggest competitive advantage, their unique culture. Manager retention reached another all-time high during the quarter and hourly retention rates remained at industry-leading levels. This high level of engagement is further evidenced by the fact that LongHorn's guest satisfaction rating for the quarter reached record levels across all key metrics. I'm extremely proud of the discipline the LongHorn leadership team brings to the business and I'm confident that adhering to their long-term strategy will continue to drive their momentum. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen total sales increased 4.2%, driven by sales growth in new restaurants of 5.4% and partially offset by same-restaurant sales decline of 1.2%. We continue to see improvement in Cheddar's HR and operations metrics, which we know are foundational elements of running great restaurants. I'm encouraged by these trends, knowing that the restaurants that have made these improvements are operating successfully. Overall staffing levels for manager and team members remain strong during the quarter and retention levels continue to move in the right direction. Hourly turnover improved by nearly 20 points compared to last year, and management turnover showed meaningful improvement as well. From an operations perspective, Cheddar's is a high-volume business that requires efficient throughput. One of the key operations metrics the team focused on during the quarter was speed of service, and they saw significant improvement versus last year. In fact, they saw strong improvement in the guest experience across all key metrics compared to last year. In addition to strengthening HR and operating fundamentals, the team also worked to improve the appeal of the amazing value Cheddar's offers. In October, they began providing every guest with their most craveable and highest rated menu item, their honey butter croissants. This is an element of guest service that we identified as an opportunity when we acquired the brand. Providing every guest with a warm honey butter croissant reinforces the wild value Cheddar's provides. After making the necessary operational adjustments to facilitate this new step of service and given the overall improvements the operations teams have made, this was the right time to roll it out. And the response from the guests and team members has been very positive. As I shared on the last call, this quarter, the Cheddar's team increased their working media spend and conducted numerous test and learns using a variety of marketing channels to drive awareness and trial. They are in the early stages of this learning and still have a lot of work to do. They will continue to invest the time, effort and resources in order to determine the most effective way to market the brand in the future. While I'm encouraged by the results we're seeing, the work at Cheddar's is far from over. Team is working on the right priorities and I'm confident they are moving in the right direction. And finally, the holidays is the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams, as they delight our guests and help create lasting quality memories. This time of the year is also a great reminder that being at service is at the heart of our business. We embrace a higher purpose of enhancing people's lives, which is why we serve with purpose to delight our guests, support our team members and make a better tomorrow. One of the ways we're working to make a better tomorrow is through our harvest program. One in eight households in our country live without consistent access to food. To help fight hunger, every one of our restaurants donates surplus food to local food banks and nonprofits in their communities on a weekly basis. More than 115 million pounds of food has been donated through this program. That's the equivalent of nearly 96 million meals. The impact of our harvest program takes on and added significance during the holidays, and I'm so proud of the passion our team members have for it. On behalf of the management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our 185,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guest and communities. I wish all of you a wonderful holiday season. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. Well, I think we are pretty clear on how sales performed throughout the quarter? We definitely had a tough wrap. And I think that we signaled that at the end of the first quarter that Lasagna Mia wasn't performing as well as we had hoped. We pulled the promotional advertising for that promotion, and we focused on the introduction of $5 take-homes. I did say -- as I stated, as we introduced Never Ending Pasta Bowl and had comparable marketing trends, trends improved throughout the quarter. And I would say, it's -- how we feel about the business is really in how we think about our guidance for the year. We've come back out and reconfirmed our guidance. And we feel as though that that business continues to perform well, continues to take market share in the industry, and we're comfortable with where we're at. Yes. That's a great question, Sara. We did know that LongHorn was performing really well throughout the quarter. And we made a decision not to push extra TRPs into Olive Garden to try to make up for the slow start we had in the quarter. We have levers to pull if we need to. We chose not to pull them and decided to let the quarter play out the way it did. And that's the beauty of the portfolio. We knew that we had really great strength in LongHorn and we didn't upped the marketing spend. We actually spent less money in advertising and marketing in the second quarter than we did the prior year. So, I think, that's -- we have to always pull back and say what's going on in the business. I do think as we do go forward, we will continue to look at how we use value in Olive Garden to drive same-restaurant sales, but also compete effectively against our competitors. And we'll have to continue to watch what our competitors are doing. And we'll have to match that intensity. Olive Garden is -- when you look at what Olive Garden's accomplished over the last four years, it's incredibly impressive. And we believe that it is positioned to continue to dominate in casual dining. And I believe we have more leverage than most to pull, to support that business. John, we had two extra weeks of media in the quarter, you saw that in the restaurant level expenses. I wouldn't give that a lot of the credence for the increase in same-restaurant sales. I think, as I said, the LongHorn team has been investing in this business for four years. Every state today is bigger or better than it was four years ago. They've invested in the bread service, they've invested in many other aspects of the overall operation. But, I think the most unique thing about LongHorn in this environment is that it is a smaller box with less employees than the average casual dining restaurant. Their ability to attract a top-quality employee, train them well and retain them, I believe enables them to execute at a higher level. And if I was to point to one thing that is driving that business, it's that single attribute right there. To answer your question, is this a sustainable trend? I don't know. All I know is this team has made -- has had a great discipline for four years, made a lot of really good investments, and I believe that they continue to do the right things every single day for their team members and their guests. And again, it's a unique operation because it's much smaller inside of smaller box and they deliver at a high level. And it all came together this quarter combined with a couple of extra weeks of media and they had a great quarter. Yes. Great question, David. I think, we'll continue to focus on non-working media spend to see how much we can pull that down to help offset the inflation. But, we will try to spend from media standpoint at the same levels without increasing the overall spend for the brand. Now, I think,, as you know, as you get around the elections, especially when you're doing a lot of national stuff and some spot television, you can get bumped. And try and make sure that we get our full complement of advertising as we move into the last six months prior to election, depending on the marketplace will be a challenge. We'll try to work around that. We've got other levers that we can pull, social, we got TDIs, we've got some other things that we can do to help offset that if we're not getting our full complement of advertising. But, we'll continue to work and focus on making sure we're as lean as we possibly can be on our non-working, so that we can maybe shift a little bit more of that into working to offset the inflation. Yes. I think, what we're seeing in the industry is that there is more pressure on some promotional constructs that have now become permanent parts of menus. You've got a big competitor out there that's stated they're going to be continue to be very, very aggressive. But, I continue to look at -- when I look at Knapp and Black Box, I continue to look at the check average is growing north of 2.5%. So, the consumer is still paying 2.5% or plus more. So, I think that you've got to -- we've got to stay on top of what's happening in the industry. We need to make sure that we're offering value in our large brands across the platform. So, some value in price, some value in portion, as we try to attract and talk to each and all the different constituents that we have for consumers. I would say that Olive Garden is the value leader and that we need to stay focused on that in making sure that we have the appropriate price point for all the consumers that want to use Olive Garden. And I think that we have the ability to lead in that, not just follow. Yes. I think that $5 take-home has been a great addition to the off-premise menu for Olive Garden. It's been well received from -- by consumers, will continue to evolve that platform over time. We think this continues to upside there. As we focus on off-premise, our biggest initiative is to improve the convenience for our consumer. We go back to -- we know the two most important things are on time and accurate. And as we continue to grow this business, we focus on those two things with the addition of ensuring that we have the right capabilities in each one of our restaurants. We're investing capital dollars into our restaurants to ensure that we have the space and the right equipment to handle the additional demand. And that's a big -- that will be a big effort over the next 12 to 18 months. And we think that we can take a little more friction out for the consumer. This is a very highly rated experience for our consumer, and we'll continue to focus on executing at a high level. As long as the consumer demand is still there, we think there is opportunity to grow this space. And I'm really excited about what we're doing. But, more importantly what excites me about what we're doing from an off-premise standpoint is the quality of the experience and the quality of the product that's leaving our restaurant. And, I believe that's why our business continues to grow. Yes. Bottom line is that we're operating better. We've got more stability. I'm starting to see a culture develop inside of Cheddar's for the first time, one culture. Right? So, you go back to when we did the acquisition, we had these three distinct cultures. And for the first time, I'm feeling like we're Cheddar's of one. And I've said all along, this is not a brand issue, this is an operations issue. And I think our teams are making significant progress. And we've got stability in a lot of places for the first time. And again, this is the beginning of a journey. But, you look at the power of LongHorn. We have the stability and what we're able to accomplish. Gaining 20 points a reduction in our employee turnover is huge. And I think we can do -- I think we can continue to do that again. And so, that's really what's got me excited. I think, we're just doing a better job. I had lunch in Cheddar's this week. It was fantastic. It was the best experience I've ever had in the Cheddar's. And so, I mean, that's why I think we're starting to make improvement. It is still -- as I said, there is still pockets in the Company where we don't have that stability yet, we don't have that tenure, and we haven't developed that culture, but we're on a much better path. Sure. When I think of LongHorn, I would just say the management turnover is sub-15%, and it's less than 10% at the managing partner level, which is very, very important. And I think, compared to industry of mid-30s. I mean, we're -- that's just -- it's industry leading, it's leading inside of Darden. We have tremendous tenure there and most importantly, we have tremendous pride in that business. And so, that's a big thing. Employee turnover is in the low 60s. That's looking much more like one of our upscale businesses. And so, you can do so many different things. Think about the lack of training costs that we have in that business and the rest of our businesses, because we're so far below the industry, but especially that one there. And I think that really leads to great operations. And I think that's what's been driving. On off-premise, our position hasn't changed on off-premise with the last mile delivery. We believe today -- we want to control the experience. We do have off-premise last mile delivery in Olive Garden. Again I'll remind everybody $75 -- above $75, and if you let us -- if you call it in before 5 o'clock, the night before, we will deliver. That's a big business. It's a growing business for us. We've got an average check in the 300s. That's business that's really worth chasing and doing. So, we're in it in our own way. But, as I think -- as we think about it as a team, we really like controlling that experience. And we get back to those two most -- those two critical aspects the consumer is looking for, on-time and accurate. And we control those when we control the overall experience. So, our position on the last mile delivery companies has not changed. I think, off-premise will continue to be a driver. I think, the $5 take-home platform will continue to be a strong driver. There's a lot of innovation that we can still do in that platform. I think that we've got other platforms out there that will continue to strengthen whether it's Buy One Take One, Never Ending Pasta Bowl. I think that the promotional pipeline continues to be strong. And I think that I want to pivot back to -- I think, this is an important time that we focus on running great restaurant, and staffing is the most critical thing that we face today in this employment environment. And so, we need to make sure that our Olive Gardens remain staffed with great people. We need to continue to focus on improving our employment proposition. These are high-volume restaurants. And I think that we win if we have the best people inside the box. I'm comfortable with our ability to create a strategy to continue the momentum, and I think there are drivers out there. Well, I think that -- Nicole, it's an interesting question. I think that for some of our consumer -- because it's such a broad audience, some of our consumer values a lot more about what they pay from a dollar standpoint, and they are looking for that entry level price point. For some of our consumers, value is more about portion size compared to price. And so, we try to find value for everybody a little bit differently. And I think you have to -- a brand that has such broad appeal, you have to have value and everything as just which part is important, the numerator, the denominator. We know that there is a guest base inside of Olive Garden that play -- that price plays a very important part of their decision making. And we have to have an offer out there a lot of the time, so that they will come to us. If they don't have an offer, they will go someplace else. We know that through our token analysis. But, we also know that there are folks out there that look at value on say chicken Alfredo. When we increased the size of the portion of chicken, the value scores went way up, and that was very important to them. But, that's on an entry level price point in Olive Garden. And so, we've got to think across a broad spectrum and define value different for each opportunity. But, we have to have something for that consumer that is very deal oriented. And we know we have to have that out -- have to have something out there most of the time. Yes. I mean, the prim demographic is 35 to 55 for Olive Garden. And we've talked about the fact that population for the prime dining out years is going to start to grow and continue to grow for a while. I would say, when we think about millennials, I think the one thing that millennials of all socioeconomic background like to do is have a lot of choice. They like to build their own meal. That's why Cucina Mia has worked so well for that cohort. But, I would tell you that millennials that have lower incomes are looking for value, just the way other groups look for value at that point in time. And I think, we have to be careful with gross generalizations of this cohort as they transition into the next phase of their life. We over-index with millennials. This is a very millennial friendly brand. It is a very social brand. And I would tell you that millennials love the value of Olive Garden because they can stretch their dollars. Yes. I think, the brand that we made the most progress in was a Yard House. And the Yard House was positive before the Thanksgiving shift. So, we are very pleased to see that. And so, we'll continue to find ways to try to use digital to promote these brands. We're doing a lot of test and learn in those brands also to try to be effective. We're trying to make -- we're making progress in all of those brands. I would say that Seasons, as Rick alluded to, Seasons was the most impacted by the holiday switch. I think, we're making progress in that business. I think they had -- I don't know if they had a meaningful impact. I mean, they had some sort of impact on the quarter. I would tell you that this -- we're testing some of this activity on a very small scale, trying to get an understanding of what can move the needle. I would say that this is an evolution. I think that we need to continue to use a new store development backfill strategy, so that we can become more efficient in some more markets to really make some of this stuff pay out a little bit more positively. So, I don't know. I can't give you a time to say, hey, this is when we think we're going to have this all figured out. I would also add that in the digital world today, it is very, very dynamic. And I think test and learn and digital is going to be something that companies are going to be doing forever, because there continues to be new avenues and new channels in which you can get to your consumer, and that audience is very fickle today compared to what it used to be with spot TV. So, I think test and learn is going to be part of our vernacular for a long time. We're still testing. There's really no further update. We continue to analyze the results. But, at this point in time, we're just in the same 10%, and we'll continue to watch how that's maturing. I think that we want to continue to see if there is something there. I mean, we're trying to value the first party -- what's the first party data worth to us and how much can we move sales with the loyalty program. We're trying to get that read. And again these are -- this is a very, very, very big decision and one that's very difficult to undo. And so, we have to have a high confidence level that this is the correct path to go down. And at this point we're not at that level yet. Yes. I mean, I think it's -- we've got -- we've had some huge calendar swings. So, I think the volatility on a comparative basis is still there. I think the environment is a little bit better than it has been in a while. I think that employment is still strong, confidence is rebounding. I think, the near-term risk of a recession has receded. So, I feel pretty good about the overall environment right now. And I don't think that us as a team, we get too worried about day-to-day, week-to-week and volatility. I mean, it's still there. There's volatility around what your competitors are doing and what we're doing. And we're not -- we're cognizant of trying to match promotional weeks, but we've had much -- we've been much more willing to make longer term decisions and let there be a little bit of volatility week-to-week with our marketing activities. So, it's made -- something that makes a little harder to read in the short-term. In the long-term, it all works out. I think it's -- might I have a real brief comment on that. This marketplace is going to be defined by winners and losers. If you have a strong value proposition and you're executing at a high level, and that execution is going to be driven by your employment proposition. In this environment attracting, retaining great employees has never been more difficult. And those that can do that with a strong value proposition are going to win. Again, a little too granular there, all I would say is that our delivery program continues to grow at a good pace. And when we're doing Never Ending Pasta Bowl, that's not a great time, I mean it's not one of our best periods for off-premise comp. It's just not a promotional item that lends itself to that. But overall, I would just say that, $5 take-home was a big piece of what we have for a new offering. It got people excited. But, our overall off-premise business continues to grow with consumer demand. And I'm not going to get into a much more detail than that. Yes. I mean, Thanksgiving has turned into one of the biggest days in upscale, and they didn't have that in the second quarter. So, I think that -- I think these upscale brands are performing really well. I mean, we have two of the best upscale brands out there today, very high volume with Capital Grille and Eddie V's, and they continue to perform at high level. So, I'm excited about what they have going forward. As I've said before, I think their books look good through the holidays. These are exciting businesses and I'm very pleased with their overall performance. Yes. John, I think that we've talked about in the past. I think that these brands are in some of the best retail trade areas in the United States. They continue to face competitive intrusion. And you have to fight that competitive intrusion off. They are small enough for a one or two restaurants being down a significant number. It can have an impact on the overall business. As I said, I'm pleased with the trends in Yard House. Seasons, we're making progress in Seasons. We've been able to pull out of a lot of the discounting that was happening in that business, which we believe was a good long-term decision that's put -- that's had an impact on the headline number. Bahama Breeze, we've had some competitive intrusion. We've also cannibalized ourselves in our biggest market Orlando, opening up a couple of restaurants that have had an impact on the overall system. And we know this market well. Those are places where we want to have restaurants. But, right now, there has been some cannibalization. I don't really pay a whole lot of attention to some of those top line numbers. I pay a lot of attention to the individual restaurants in each group and I understand how they're performing. These are well-positioned brands that continue to perform well. But, they are in the best trade areas in America and they're facing competition. Well, I think that there is a growth opportunity with LongHorn. I mean, we're concentrating on entering new territory slowly and we're focused on trying to backfill where we have opportunities. We think the governor to growth is the human capital. This is a brand that is very important how we develop our culture and how we run it. But, we are on a path to do 15 to 20 this year, which is a pretty good number. We haven't opened up any LongHorns in California. That's really the last big territory available to us. We are going to open up a restaurant this spring in California to see how the brand is received. We'll open a few more and will support that. But, we're very-pleased with this. And I love the controlled growth, because to me that's where -- we're in 43 states. So, I don't know where you got your number from... LongHorn is in 43 states today, over 500 units, closing on $2 billion brand. We're going to continue to grow this. This brand has growth opportunity. We're going to grow it responsibly. We look at every real estate opportunities, what is the best way? If the building has a good enough structure, we will do a rehab. We've done a few of those. If we don't believe the building has the structure to really be a good place for a LongHorn over 30 years, then we'll blow it -- we'll tear it down. But, each individual site is evaluated through an economic lens and say, which is the best economic outcome for the investment. Yes. Stephen, good question. We have not had any emphasis on improving our off-premise sales in Cheddar's. We believe this to be a big opportunity, and it's an opportunity that we will tackle over the next 6 to 18 months. We need to go back and we need to develop good processes, understand what the -- develop good capabilities, implement online ordering, which is not accessible today, all those things are growth opportunity. And it all will be sequenced in when we believe we have the right operational capabilities to handle it. But you have identified a future growth vehicle for Cheddar's. Yes. I believe that you'll see us use that lever appropriately. We have been in the marketplace testing some new offers with some relatively short expiration time to see how they -- how the consumer reacts to them. It is just one piece of our overall tool kit to drive the business. Now we -- again, we have identified as we pulled out and slowed down our TDIs over last year, there is a consumer out there that will only visit our restaurants when we have an incentive out there. So, we need -- we've learned that we need to have something out there for this consumer. And we'll continue to -- we talk about one of our focuses, when we talk about back to basics is our integrated marketing approach. And this is part of our integrated marketing approach is how do we use TDIs, how do we use other discounts or incentives and combined with what we're doing on a promotional level too. We always think about those in unison. So, it is not a lever that we can pull. I will say for those that do look at our frequency, I would urge you not to look at that in isolation, because there are other parts of our media spend that have a lot more impact than our TDI spend, primarily how many total rating points we have in the marketplace. Yes. I'm going to probably dodge that a little bit and give you the standard answer that we'll continue to evaluate our current portfolio and evaluate the opportunities to add to the portfolio. As you know we're -- we continue to look at the opportunities out there, we continue to look at the opportunities internally, and we'll continue to have those discussions with our management team and our Board. And while we're doing that, we're going to continue to focus on running the great brands that we have. No. I think that anytime you -- testing environment is small and it's always different than a macro test. So, we're not sure what else was going on. We made the decision. I think in hindsight we may have made that decision too quickly and didn't give a chance to play out. But, we did what we thought was right -- right, wrong or indifferent. We made a pivot, and it's behind us and now we're moving on. I'll answer them backwards. I think it's just focus. I think, we're focusing on those busiest hours, we're asking for our top management person in the restaurant to be at the front door to help with that process. It's like anything else in our business. When we focus on something, we get it. And management team, they've done a great job of focusing on that. I think, the beauty of the LongHorn quarter is I can't point -- I'm not going to point to anything in specific. I believe this is a quarter where four years of investment, a couple of extra weeks of really, really good advertising that's resonated with the consumer, great stability in the leadership roles in the restaurants, all came together and we had a great quarter. Anybody that tries to isolate and to point to one thing other than a one-time promotion, I believe it's very hard -- very difficult to do. And I just think everything came together for LongHorn, great quarter, great job to the team. Anybody that's out there listening, you guys did a great job."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene. Good morning, everyone. We had another good quarter with second quarter total sales growth of 4.2%, driven by 2.2% growth from the addition of 37 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2%. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, same-restaurant sales benefited by about 80 basis points this quarter, driven by two factors. First, an increase of approximately 100 basis points due to Thanksgiving moving from the second quarter in fiscal 2019 into the third quarter in fiscal 2020. As a reminder, the third quarter should see a corresponding decrease to same-restaurant sales because of this shift. And second, approximately 20 basis points of headwind due to the impact of Hurricane Dorian early in the second quarter. Second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.12, an increase of 21.7% from last year's diluted net earnings per share. We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $136 million in shares, returning over $240 million to our shareholders this quarter. Additionally this quarter, we had $0.91 of adjustments to our reported diluted net earnings per share. This was primarily the result of a $147 million pretax charge related to the termination of our primary noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, most of which was non-cash. The termination of this plan and the anticipated expense was previously communicated in our fiscal 2019 Form 10-K. Now turning to our detailed margin results. Food and beverage costs were 20 basis points favorable to last year, as pricing of just over 2% and continued cost savings initiatives offset commodity inflation of approximately 1.7% and continued investments. Second quarter restaurant labor was unfavorable 10 basis points to last year. Total labor inflation of 4% was offset by pricing, check mix and productivity improvements in new and existing restaurants. We continue to manage labor well in this environment, given the heightened inflationary pressures we still face. Marketing expense was 30 basis points unfavorable to last year. Approximately 40% of this was related to LongHorn marketing and timing shift from the first to the second quarter, and the remainder was driven by increased media spending in our other segments, primarily Cheddar's. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin of 16.5% was 20 basis points lower than last year. General and administrative expense was 40 basis points better than last year, as we wrapped on higher incentive expense and sales leverage. Our second quarter effective tax rate of 5.9% was favorably impacted by the resolution of prior year's tax projects that were contemplated in our earlier guidance. Excluding these projects, our effective tax rate would have been closer to 11% for the quarter. All of this culminated in adjusted earnings after tax margin of 6.7%, 90 basis points higher than last year. Turning to our segment performance, Olive Garden grew sales and profit in the quarter driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin increased by 20 basis points by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing costs effectively. LongHorn also grew sales and segment profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. However, segment profit margin decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to the marketing timing shift I mentioned earlier, which increased marketing as a percent of sales in the quarter for LongHorn. In addition, LongHorn continued to have slightly elevated beef inflation, while making continued investments during the quarter. Fine Dining segment grew sales and profit in the quarter as well, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin decreased versus last year 10 basis points due to higher pre-opening expense and inefficiencies related to our four new restaurants opened year-to-date. Sales for our Other Business segment grew 3.5%, driven by net new restaurants. Both segment profit dollars and margin decreased this quarter due to incremental marketing expense, primarily at Cheddar's and margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales growth. As you saw in the press release this morning, we reiterated all aspects of our fiscal 2020 outlook. As we look forward to the second half of fiscal 2020, we feel confident in our ability to achieve same-restaurant sales between 1% to 2% for the year, resulting in adjusted diluted net earnings per share of between $6.30 and $6.45. Finally, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we will modify the reporting of same-restaurant sales to align with our four reportable business segments: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Fine Dining, and Other Business. This change will better align the current reporting of segment profits with reportable segment sales growth metrics. Before I close, I'd like to wish all of our 185,000 team members, and each of you a safe and happy holiday season. And with that, we'll take your questions. Yes. John, we still feel comfortable of our guidance for total commodity inflation of 1% to 2%. We were a little higher -- at the higher end of that range of 1.7% this quarter. A couple of things on beef. We're really not seeing significant changes to what we thought would be in the beef market. The only thing we're seeing from ASF right now, as we said a couple of quarters ago, we only have about 2% of our pork -- of our buy as pork. But, there could be an impact, 18 months from now into overall proteins. We are seeing a little bit in ground beef right now but we're covered for the year on ground beef. So, we still feel really good about where we are. Chicken, we are starting to see a little bit of inflation, but we're again we're covered for that as well. A couple of things. One, we've said quite a few times that we don't expect to have labor below last year for quite a while as we keep inflation. And so, this quarter played out, we're about 10 basis points lower than last year in labor. The productivity, if you remember, a lot of that started with new restaurants last year around the third quarter and we started to see a little bit of an increase in productivity from new restaurants. That should start lapping itself. So, we still feel pretty good about managing our labor well the way -- based on inflation, what's going on now. And we've all contemplated that in our guidance of 1% to 2% total inflation. I'm sorry. 2.5% total inflation. Yes. Jeff, every year at the beginning of the year when we guide, we guide what we think is appropriate and we adjust as things play out. And things have been playing out exactly as we thought, which is why we haven't changed our guide. In the past, things have been a little bit better than what we thought in the beginning of the year. So, that's why we've adjusted up. But, I wouldn't say that we were more aggressive in this year's guide than we have in the past. We used the same philosophy that we always have. It just happens that the first quarter and the second quarter didn't outperform what we thought as much as it has in the prior year. That's why we didn't raise our performance. And we still have, coming into the back half of this fiscal year, chances of weather, chances of election and everything else is going on in talking about consumers having other things to think about. So, again, we didn't change anything the way we've done things in the past, and we feel pretty good about where our guide is right now. Hey, Brett. It's Rick. In regards to the calendar shift -- lot of questions there, but, in regards to the calendar shift, they impacted -- it impacted brand differently. So, the casual brands were impacted favorably in general and the finer dining brands were impacted unfavorably in general, and each brand was impacted a little differently. Within the casual brands, Cheddar's having the smallest positive impact. The regionality of that really wasn't that different. So, it's basically -- Thanksgiving shift was no different in one region than another. The only regionality would be whether. And market share gap for the quarter by month, we don't really want to get into the change in share gap by months, other than what Gene said about Olive Garden being negative in the first month and having to dig out of that a little bit to get to be positive for the quarter. And then, on operating metrics for Olive Garden specifically, their operating metrics are at all time highs. So, there guest satisfaction, a lot of their different metrics operationally are all-time highs and they were at all-time highs for every month of the quarter. So, hopefully that answers those questions. But, thanks Brett. Chris, this is Rick. The check benefit from the $5 take-home was not negated by the NEPB, Never Ending Pasta Bowl. It was really the lunch investment that we made earlier in the fiscal year that drove our check down. If you think about Olive Garden check, Olive Garden's check grew by 2.7% for the quarter. 2% of that was pricing, about 80 basis points was catering, and everything else washed. So, if you think about the 80 basis points of catering, you can think about that, like guest counts, since we don't talk about -- we don't give them credit for guests. But, to answer your question, no, $5 take-home was not offset by NEPB. Hey, Katy. This is Rick. The Olive Garden, LongHorn were pretty similar in benefit for the Thanksgiving shift. Hey, John. It's Rick. The calendar shift for Darden was 100 basis points favorable. As I said on the call, the casual brands were benefited by that and the upscale Fine Dining brands were hurt. And the upscale Fine Dining brands were hurt more than the casual dining brands were helped, but the casual dining brands are bigger. That's why we're at about 100 basis points. There weren't really many brands in the middle. We've pretty much had casual. I also mentioned that Cheddar's was the least benefited of the casual brands. And again, everything that's Fine Dining that takes reservations was hurt. Yes. I don't think -- we don't believe that they're cannibalizing future visits. I mean, obviously, I think the people make a choice, am I going to eat in or you out tonight, and we want to be in both those decision sets. I go back inside the quarter and say we started off, we had a great promotion last year with Buy One Take One and we had a promotion that was weaker. I think, it's important that -- we're sitting here today admitting that we didn't hit the mark on Lasagna Mia and we pulled off the promotional advertising to support that. Not everything that we're going to do is going to work, but you got to -- we recognize that this wasn't -- something wasn't right with it and we didn't put the promotional dollars behind it, and we pivoted. And I think that that put us in a hole in the quarter, and we decided to let it play out. And that's primarily because we had LongHorn doing well. So, I don't -- I think that -- I look at it is all one big pool. And we've been saying it for you, we're going to try to feed people Olive Garden where and when they want it. And I think that we're doing a great job with that. And I'm excited about what we've done at launch. We've definitely improved that trend. We're competing more effectively. And I believe into the future, we'll have to make strategic adjustments to compete more effectively at dinner too. You're constantly evolving in this business, you're not staying still. And so, I'm confident in our team, I'm confident in our insights, and all I want to do is sell Olive Garden food to some \u2013 anybody that wants and anywhere they want it. We were definitely out there with a lot more incentives, and that was part of we need to be out there because we pulled back on the advertising spend. So, it's just -- again, it's a small channel in which we play in, but we definitely increased and we also were out there doing a ton of testing. So, test and learn just doesn't apply to our smaller brands. It was test and learn inside of Olive Garden, probably the most test, trying to understand which TDIs would resonate with consumers, how long of time that they need to put on those to activate the consumer. So, we were definitely in the marketplace and it's a great way for us to talk to our E-club members. So, again, I just think it's a risk for you to look at all of that in isolation because the media spend was down significantly and we were testing and learning in this channel."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode and we will have question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please take note that we'll only take one question and one follow-up. Now, let me hand the call over to your host, Kevin Kalicak. You may begin. \nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Ray. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings on December 19 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and Rick will provide more detail on our financial results from the first quarter. As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated Knapp-Track excluding Darden, specifically, Olive Garden and LongHorn. During our first fiscal quarter, industry total sales growth was flat, industry same-restaurant sales declined 1.2% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 3.3%. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene. \nGene Lee: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we had a solid quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.1 billion, an increase of 3.5%. Same-restaurant sales increased 0.9% and diluted net earnings per share were $1.38. Comparable same-restaurant sales for the industry continued to weaken during the quarter as the industry once again faced tougher comparisons. However, the industry comping negative is surprising considering unemployment remains at all-time low and there continues to be strong wage growth, which historically has been a positive for the industry. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, given the industry performance and their difficult comparisons over the first quarter of last year. We remain focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy and leveraging our four competitive advantages. And I'm pleased, we continued to take share and protect our margins. Turning to brand highlights for the quarter. Olive Garden had strong quarter, which resulted in its 20th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 3.6%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 2.2% and 1.4% growth in new restaurants. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales gap to the industry was 340 basis points this quarter, representing the largest gap to the industry since the first quarter of fiscal 2019. And on a two-year basis Olive Garden grew total sales by nearly 10%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 840 basis points. Olive Garden's results were driven by the team's ongoing focus on flawless execution, everyday value, and convenience. Guest satisfaction ratings remain impressive, and catering delivery metrics reflect the highest intent to recommend within the brand giving us confidence that our teams are delivering great experiences inside and outside the four walls of our restaurants. The Olive Garden team made a strategic decision to change the order of their first quarter promotions. This was necessary to separate their two strongest value promotions; Buy One Take One, and Never Ending Pasta Bowl to more evenly deliver the value messaging throughout the year. While this change along with associated media shifts and weakening industry trends resulted in lower traffic than last year, it was the right strategic decision for the long term. Recognizing the strength of Buy One Take One promotion, Olive Garden added $5 take-home entr\u00e9es to the Everyday value lineup, which was supported with national advertising to drive awareness. It has been met with strong guest demand, and it will be a catalyst to continue to grow the off-premise business. Everyday value was also strengthened with the introduction of a new weekday lunch menu with 21 options under $10, including guest favorites like Chicken Parmigiana and items from the Taste of the Mediterranean menu like Chicken Margarita. This initiative was supported by integrated marketing and resulted in stronger weekday lunch traffic and guest preference. Finally, the Olive Garden team remains focused on their off-premise capabilities to meet their guests' needs for convenience. A key part of that focus has been optimizing the digital sales channel for both mobile and desktop. During the quarter, digital sales grew by more than 30% and represented approximately 40% of to go sales. Overall, off-premise sales grew 12%, representing 14% of total sales. Olive Garden remains a truly iconic and broadly appealing brand and the team is doing an excellent job of focusing on this strategy and competing effectively. LongHorn Steakhouse had a strong quarter as well. Total sales grew 4.6%, driven by 2% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.6%, the 26th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. On a two-year basis, LongHorn grew total sales by 11%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 940 basis points. The LongHorn team remains focused on their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution, and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement. During the quarter, the LongHorn team ran two successful menu promotions; Grill Master Favorite and Fire Crafted Flavors, which were supported by their award-winning You Can't Fake Steak advertising campaign. They also supported these promotions by reinforcing their quality story through multiple guest touch points. The team also continued to focus on ensuring the to go experience equals their in-restaurant experience for guests who choose this convenience. The team simplified the online ordering process, which significantly reduced the order time. During the quarter, digital sales grew almost 50% and represented more than one-third of total to go sales. Additionally, they have now completed a dedicated to go area in more than half of their restaurants. These actions led to continued improvement in guest satisfaction scores for order accuracy and timeliness and helped to drive to go sales growth nearly 12%. Finally, LongHorn's industry-leading retention rates continue to even get better despite the tight labor market. Team member turnover during the quarter was 68% compared to approximately 120% for casual dining, and management turnover during the quarter was 13% compared to approximately 36% for casual dining. We know that engaged team members provide better guest experiences, and the LongHorn team's ongoing focus on retention and culture building is a key driver of the strong business performance. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen total sales decreased 2%, driven by same-restaurant sales decline of 5.4%, and partially offset by sales growth from new restaurants of 3.4%. The trend change was driven by reduced marketing efforts and overall industry softness in the quarter. In addition, the same-restaurant sales decline continued to be more pronounced in the former franchise locations. These restaurants experienced significant disruption during the quarter as they were the last restaurants to complete the kitchen transformation project. While it's disappointing to see the sales trend decline, the Cheddar's team made significant progress against their priorities during the quarter. At the beginning of the new fiscal year, they established three new strategic priorities; create a people focused results-oriented culture, reduce friction in the guest experience, and build a brand people talk about with the goal of building on the progress they made last year repairing [ph] fundamental elements of the business and improving the sales trajectory. During the quarter, the Cheddar's team continued to see improvements in both the manager and team member turnover trends as they implemented initiatives that led to higher retention levels. Overall, staffing levels for both the manager and team members improved during the quarter. Because of the progress made this quarter in staffing and intention, the Cheddar's team was able to better execute operational improvements designed to enhance the guest experience. For example, they implemented standard that significantly upgraded their abilities to successfully serve large parties. With these and other improvements, they saw a better guest experience results compared to last year across all key metrics. Near the end of the quarter, Cheddar's introduced the new menu with more price diversity within categories and they launched their Quick Pick Lunch Combos starting at $5.99. These combos are generating strong preference at lunch and have led to higher value and intend to return ratings compared to last year. I recognized there's still a lot of work to do, but the progress the Cheddar's team has made operationally and their improved HR metrics are encouraging. Now that they feel they're moving in the right direction from an operation and staffing perspective, they will begin to increase their working media spend. Cheddar's has the highest guest frequency of any Darden brand and this investment is intended to build upon the strong position, improve brand awareness and drive trial. They will be leveraging Darden resources and best practices to implement the media plan. Finally, during the quarter, we acquired four previously franchise restaurant locations in Texas, and I'm pleased to say that each of these four restaurants is performing at a very high level. In closing, I\u2019m pleased with the progress our teams made executing against the strategic initiatives. Our strategy is working, allowing us to continue to grow sales, increased market share, improve margins and invest in our people and brands, all while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Of course, none of this would be possible of having the best people in the business, so I want to take this opportunity to thank you our 185,000 team members who continued to create memorable dining experiences for our guests. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. We had another good quarter with total sales growth of 3.5%, driven by 2.6% growth from the addition of 40 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%. First quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, an increase of 3% from last year's diluted net earnings per share. We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $95 million in shares, returning over $200 million to shareholders this quarter. Before I get into the detailed results from this quarter, I want to mention that we adopted the new accounting standard for leases at the beginning of this fiscal year. Consistent with the expectation discussed on last quarter's call, we estimate that this will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.05 in fiscal 2020. However, the more meaningful impact was to our balance sheet, as you saw from this morning's press release. This quarter, we also updated our segment reporting. Beginning in fiscal 2020, our calculation of segment profit now excludes non-cash real estate related expenses and fiscal 2019 has been restated for comparability. This change allows for more consistent evaluation of our business across segments and fiscal periods. Now turning to our detailed margin results. Food and beverage costs were flat to last year, as pricing of 2% and continued cost savings initiatives offset commodity inflation of approximately 1.5% and continued investments. I'm impressed with restaurant labor being flat to last year, particularly in light of same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%. Total labor inflation of 4% was offset by pricing, check mix and productivity improvements in new and existing restaurants. Restaurant expense was unfavorable 10 basis points due to deleverage, as our comp sales growth was below inflation. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin of 18.1% was 10 basis points unfavorable to last year. General and administrative expense was 50 basis points lower than last year and favorable mark-to-market expense, which is generally offset in the tax line, lower management incentive expense and sales leverage. Our Q1 effective tax rate of 9.8% was slightly below the range in our annual guidance. We still anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11% for the fiscal year. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter and impressed with our strong EAT margin of 8.1%. Turning to our segment performance. Olive Garden grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin increased 40 basis points, by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing cost-effectively. LongHorn also grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin decreased slightly, due to elevated beef inflation and continued investments during the quarter. Fine Dining grew sales and profit in the quarter as well, driven by a positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin decreased because of higher pre-opening expense and inefficiencies related to three new restaurants. Sales for our Other Business segment grew 1.8%, driven by net new restaurants. Both segment profit dollars and margin decreased this quarter due to margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter. As you saw in the press release, we reiterated all aspects of our fiscal 2020 outlook. Looking ahead at our second quarter performance, there are two things I would like to address before we open up the call for questions. Both of which are contemplated in our annual guidance. First, the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday this year, relative to last, is shifting from the second quarter, into the third quarter. Since we are closed in the majority of our restaurants on this day, this shift should positively impact Darden's second quarter same-restaurant sales, by approximately 80 to 100 basis points with a corresponding offset in the third quarter. Second, given a prolonged media coverage and the storms duration, Hurricane Dorian had a meaningful impact on the first two weeks of our fiscal second quarter. We are currently estimating a drag of 20 to 30 basis points to same-restaurant sales in the second quarter. And with that, we'll take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open, sir.\nMatt DiFrisco: Thank you. My question is with respect to the Cheddar's, I guess, lagging in difference between Olive Garden and LongHorn. Would you attribute that mostly, it sounds like to the marketing spend? Can you sort of bracket or compare how much pullbacks of marketing spend there was versus last year in either terms of dollars or in terms of weeks of support, so we could get a better understanding of that?\nGene Lee : I'm not -- we're not going to get that granular with our spending in Cheddar's. I would just say that we now have enough transactional data to look at some things in Cheddar's we haven't had the opportunity to do before. And one of the big insights is that our frequency in Cheddar's is higher than any other Darden brand. And we married that up with some of the research that we were doing, and we recognized that our awareness for this brand is extremely low. And our primary advertising had been more driven towards a frequency play. And we decided, once we have this insight during the quarter, we were pulling -- we pulled back from that type of activity, and now we're going go out and we're going to test and learn and understand how to best increase our awareness in markets. We also recognize the fact that it's going to be more important than ever in this environment to continue to build out our markets, develop our -- become more efficient in those markets from a media standpoint, and I would say more -- use more traditional media to increase our awareness to drive this business. And so, it was a really good quarter from that -- from an insight standpoint for us to really recognize, and we decided we were going to change direction and that's where we pulled back a little bit of the media spend during the quarter.\nMatt DiFrisco: Okay. And then, I guess, is there something different to the menu that may be triggered a change in frequency to the heavy, heavy user from the past, or is it the change in ownership that they noticed or something like that?\nGene Lee : No, it's just the fact that we actually now have the transactional data to be able to analyze and have that insight. That's why it's so important when we do an acquisition for us to put our systems in, so that we can get the data and then do our analysis.\nMatt DiFrisco: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. Sir, your line is open.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. Gene, I just wanted to talk to about the industry trends that you're seeing. It seems like your analysis in the prepared remarks that this was a little surprising that we've seen such soft trends, especially in the most recent months. So just curious to get your thoughts on why you think that's happening? And secondly, do you think you need to adjust any of your marketing or promotional strategies to the new environment so to speak? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Yeah. Good morning, David. As I said in my prepared remarks, the backdrop appears to be very strong for the consumer. We have good wage growth. We have strong employment. Historically, that's been really good for us. As we look at the data and we when look at behaviors, when we look at confidence I have -- I personally believe that there's some uncertainty entering into the consumer, and it's impacting their confidence. How long? I\u2019ve got to believe there with all the media attention around what's happening, how long does this continue -- this environment continue? So, there's nothing structural that we see that's changed out there other than there appears to be a little bit more uncertainty today than there was in the future. As far as what do we need to do? We need to continue to create compelling guest experiences and come up with -- and reinforce our value propositions. I do think that we have to think about how we're going to market in our smaller brands and how do we advertise those brands in different channels and become more effective and compete more effectively? I think that's an important change that we need to make in the upcoming quarters. I think we have the luxury of being patient and test and learn and really make great long-term decisions as we try to figure out how to support those brands and compete more effectively in this marketplace. We're pleased that we're heading into Never Ending Pasta Bowl in Olive Garden, it\u2019s a great promotion for us. We had a lot of buzz around our Pasta Pass this year. And so, I think it's a good promotion going into this time of year and where the consumer\u2019s at.\nDavid Tarantino: And maybe just a follow-up Gene, does the current environment, or what you've seen recently make you think differently about the degree of difficulty in hitting your comp guidance for the year? I know you have maybe lesser fiscal [ph] comparisons coming up. And how should we think about the middle of the comp guidance or the upper end of the comp guidance relative to where you were three months ago?\nGene Lee: Well, I guess, we reiterated our guidance today. We believe our same restaurant sales for the year will be somewhere between 1% and 2%.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is actually Neal [ph] on for Will. Thanks for taking the question. Just quick one here. Wondering if you can give any insights into commodity costs? You spoke to some elevated beef costs there. Just wondering how you're feeling about this going forward, whether you\u2019ve seen any effects from African swine fever?\nRicardo Cardenas: Thanks, Neal. This is Rick. We were about 1.5% inflation in the first quarter, which is around where we expected it to be. We have seen a little bit of elevation in beef, but the boards are coming back down and are a little bit more in our favor. So, we still expect our inflation to be where we thought at the beginning of this fiscal year. As a result, or as an answer to your African Swine Flu question, we still haven't seen a very big impact in African Swine Flu. As we mentioned in the last call, pork is really only about 2% of our sales. So, it's a relatively small impact. And we haven't seen the downstream impacts of pork prices yet.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Joshua Long from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.\nJoshua Long: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back to the trends you've seen here lately and maybe any sort of regional variations, or any regional variations you've seen across the system? And then, also, in terms of your initiatives and kind of the underlying trends you've seen, any sort of differences in the weekday, weekend trends? You've got some very strong lunch offerings in there, but didn't know if that was may be moving the needle like you expected or may be ahead of expectations?\nGene Lee: No. I really don't have a lot to add to your question. We\u2019ve really not seen much from a geographic standpoint and there's really been no trend change to any of the weekday, weekday night, weekday lunch or a weekend business. I would say that, the trends have weakened in all areas of the business.\nJoshua Long: Great. Thanks. And then one follow-up, if I may, in terms of your work on the To Go business, the strength there is still very promising. Any sort of learnings you've had as you stuck with this and worked on the fulfillment internally, versus the thought process of working with external partners? I know, you're always testing and always learning. But curious on what you're seeing there, if there's any update.\nGene Lee: I think, the biggest thing our teams are doing is, they\u2019re taking friction out of the process. And, I think, we're getting -- it\u2019s like anything else, repetition is a great thing. You continued to get better and better with it, as you do more business. So, I think LongHorn has made tremendous progress. We've seen their scores go up, their satisfaction scores go up. Olive Garden has really honed in on this process. They continue to find ways. Very, very impressed with the digital growth in both of those businesses. We think that's something to continue to look at. So to me, it's really about making that experience as compelling as we possibly can with great value, right. I think, it's -- and that's been our strategy is, to make sure that we have strong value on the off premise and not have the consumer be willing to come pick it up, versus it being delivered.\nJoshua Long: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Levy from MKM Partners. Your line is open.\nBrett Levy: Good morning. Thanks for taking the call, gentlemen. If we could just hone in a little bit more, I'm going to ask the consumer question a different way and hopefully get some sentiment of a different answer. When you think about\u2026\nGene Lee: We could try.\nBrett Levy: I'll try. When you think about the consumers right now, are you seeing any changes in how they're using you? Obviously, take-home is further building out your off premise, but are you seeing any changes in terms of full price value add-ons, size of parties, something like that? Thank you.\nGene Lee: No, Brett. No, we haven't seen any change at all. And -- when I look at the quarter -- let me put it back to look at the quarter. Let's think about what Olive Garden has done in the last two years. Even though the industry has weakened, I'm incredibly impressed that we've grown our business approximately 10% at Olive Garden with two-year comp that I think is extremely impressive. And so the industry and a lot of the comments that I made today about the industry decelerating, I look at our two large brands; I think they're competing very effectively. The gaps are very, very strong to the industry. So, I think we have a way to compete very effectively with these two brands and I'm excited. And yes, we watch the industry and we give you some insight to it, but our job and our leaders' jobs are to find a way to compete effectively in any environment and I think that's what our teams have done really well in this first quarter. \nBrett Levy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJohn Ivankoe: Yes. Hi. Thank you. It\u2019s also just an industry question for you Gene. Obviously, Knapp all-store traffic has actually been negative and what I think you said to a previous question is a relatively strong underlying consumer environment, especially in terms of some of topline trending. Where do you see -- that consumer actually going? I mean where -- if that consumer is working and that consumer has higher income, where is that consumer currently dining -- whether it\u2019s in the house or out of the house is kind of the first question? Secondly, do you see independence -- being great cycle as we are as potentially taking care versus chains? And what would you look out to maybe a shake that some supply growth that\u2019s been added in the space over the last several years? And then the final point, I think, you kind of you mentioned a few times more value at Olive Garden and in Cheddar\u2019s. Is there any thought of bringing back couponing and doing other things that are going to be direct call to action for the consumer for you to maintain traffic and what you described earlier as any industry environment?\nGene Lee: John, you get the award for most questions inside a one question.\nJohn Ivankoe: It's all related. I think you can do it in one paragraph. \nGene Lee: I got independence, I got discount. What was the first?\nJohn Ivankoe: The first one was\u2026\nGene Lee: Where are people are going. John we are definitely seeing some strength in limited service both fast casual and quick-serve, there's no doubt about that. And you think about there is good income growth on the lower end of the curve and those folks seem to be trading or dining out a little bit more frequently. And I don't know where people are trading out of in casual when you look at a 10-year period, that's been a big question. I'm not sure we\u2019ve had -- we as an industry, you have an answer. Again, we focused on our brands and we seem to be getting more than our fair share. The data that we're looking at is saying that large chains are still taking more share and they're taking that share from independence. Where you see independence and small regional change are in really what I would call the better, better trade areas, the higher income trade areas, where they are having an impact and I think performing well. But I think on a national scale, when you look at it, independence are still donating share and large brands continue to do better and take share from both smaller probably a little bit older brands and independents. As far as discounting, we're going to continue to use, whatever levers we can use to grow our business. When you look at -- when we look at incentives, we don't look at just as one piece. We have to look at our overall advertising program. What is going on from a television standpoint, what's going on from a digital and online, what are we doing from an incentive standpoint. We have multiple ways to put incentives out there. And so we have a lot of leverage that we can pull over time depending on the environment. And we will use those appropriately to drive our business in a profitable way. The one thing that, I think that we are proud of, and I'm very proud of our teams is that we continue to drive our business, while protecting our margins. And we continue to invest in our business, invest in quality, invest in food, invest in portion size, invest in our people, and we're able to do that in a way that has protected our margins. And as Rick talked about, our plus 8% EBIT margins are incredibly impressive in this environment. And so when we think about incentives, we think about it holistically and all that we're doing to build our brands over the long-term.\nJohn Ivankoe: That's great, very helpful, excellent answer.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Over the last couple of months, we've been hearing a lot more about delivery take rates coming down, being renegotiated lower. Wondering if that changes your perspective on the liability of delivery for Darden at all, especially as you've kind of highlighted some of the changes on the digital side and the willingness given the numbers that you cited for customers to engage with the brands digitally, if your thoughts are evolving at all on delivery?\nGene Lee: No. We haven't -- we really haven't -- have any -- thoughts haven't evolved at all. We will acknowledge that the cost burden does appear to be shifting from the company to the consumer, and we are going to watch that closely. But I think -- I have a lot of concerns about that. This is still -- we're still -- it's all about value and how much of the overall experience are you willing to dedicate towards convenience? And so it's something to watch. It's definitely a shift that we internally predicted that would happen. And we'll watch it, but I want to pivot back to what I said earlier, our job is to create a compelling off-premise experience right now that -- with so much value that consumer is willing to come and get it. That seems to be working for us and we're going to continue to focus on that.\nAndrew Strelzik: If I could just follow-up on the value piece then just quickly. The Olive Garden price was about 2% for the quarter. Was that what the underlying price was? Not that it's a huge deviation from where you've been prior, but should be thinking about a little bit more price broadly at Olive Garden going forward?\nRick Cardenas: Andrew, this is Rick. The price was 2.2%, I believe in the first quarter and that's just due to timing of pricing year-over-year. We still expect our price to be below 2%, which is our long-term goal to keep pricing below our inflation and below our competitors to increase our value perception in the marketplace, while still making great investments. So, yes, this was just a little bit of a timing anomaly for the quarter.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Anderson from Maxim. Your line is open.\nStephen Anderson: Yes. Good morning. I would actually want to ask about the test you have underway for your rewards programs to see a multi-concept. As I recall, it\u2019s about 7% of your storage, you're testing that out right now. I wanted to ask about how the test is progressing? And whether you are ready to roll that out to additional locations, or potentially entire system? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Stephen, this is Rick again. Thanks for the question. As you said, yes, we have our loyalty program in about 7% of our restaurants and that -- across the nation. We're still monitoring that test. As we have said quite a few times, this is going to take a long time to understand the frequency driving nature of the loyalty program and how much we\u2019d have to provide discounts to our most loyal consumers to come to us, versus other incentives for them to come. The test is going okay. It's going well, but we're not ready to pull the trigger on adding more restaurants. We're going nationally. And when we do, I am sure all of you will be to first to know. But, right now, we're kind of holding steady on our test. The fact that it's still out there, tells you that it's not going well, but we want to just make sure that it's the right thing to do in the long run, as part of what Gene says, our overall strategy of how do we market to our consumers.\nStephen Anderson: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Also, please limit your question to one question and one follow-up. Thank you. Our next question is from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is open.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you. Just wanted to ask about mix, and I guess specifically on Olive Garden, is the impact that you saw in the quarter was roughly in line with expectation prior to the quarter? And then, more importantly, just looking out over the next few quarters, anything that would make you think the mix contribution could remain above kind of a long-term steady state? I guess if you could just kind of highlight some of the mix considerations this year, some of the puts and takes, thinking about incentives, trade-up promos, catering delivery or catering off-premise, et cetera. Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Two things, I think, that will probably drive mix maybe a little bit above our target will be continued growth in catering and catering delivery and the addition of the $5 Take Homes. Those two things probably are going to drive that mix slightly above our long-term expectations. The $5 Take Home is a great value offering and it's something that we think is a real catalyst to continue to drive the off premise business, which should have a little bit more of a positive mix than what we want to try to do for a long-term.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I think in the first quarter you benefited from a few extra weeks of the Buy One Take One as you pull that forward. But I think you said in your comment that it was a drag on traffic due to media shift. So I was wondering if you can maybe clarify what you meant there. And I know you had the hurricane impact, but perhaps you can quantify what the impact of not having those extra weeks of the Buy One Take One in the early part of the second quarter? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: No. We're not going to talk about the second quarter impact. And we shifted some media; we moved things around, which is always going to move our comparisons somewhat. But I'll go back to my statement; this was something we think strategically needed to be done. And -- again, I would also add this also always shifts in our media spending, as we -- it's the only way you can really discern what is working and what is not working and what -- and where to put more weight against, whether it's promotion or lunch or value is that you have to change the media spend to learn. And so we shifted a little bit inside the quarter. I wouldn't get caught up in that I point back to a great two-year stack great our performance in the industry. We made a strategic -- a big strategic choice to separate the two value promotions that gives us more balance in our value messaging throughout the year, which is really important. Let's not get hung up on a week-to-week media shifts.\nEric Gonzalez: If I could maybe sneak in a follow-up there. On the $5 take-home and the Buy One Take One are similar type of -- they are sort of similar programs, are you moving away from Buy One Take One next year or is that something that's on the table?\nGene Lee: No, I think they're similar, but different. And so there are different types of value offering and our team will continue to reenergize Buy One Take One, it's an important part of our value proposition. And if it's done right, it will continue to support the $5 take-home. It shouldn't be a cannibalistic thing. It should -- it really should support it and move it after you run Buy One Take One that should be the springboard for a $5 take-home for the rest of the year and you can reenergize the promotion each year. So, that's how we're thinking about that. So, it should be additive not -- it shouldn't be dilutive at all.\nEric Gonzalez: That's helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJohn Glass: Thanks. Thanks very much. First just on the other brands and the continued softness there. I think you commented last quarter that there is increased competition. So, maybe what we're seeing here is just more of that. But can you talk about how you think about -- what it's a breakthrough strategy to help market those brands better if you can achieve them national advertising scale of those brands? And does delivery makes sense in some -- we talk about delivery holistically, do you like delivery or not. But does it make sense in some brands, may be some of these smaller brands, it's worth giving a try given that they don't have that scale and delivery through the aggregator sort of provide scale that they don't otherwise have?\nGene Lee: Well, it's an interesting concept John. As you think about the smaller brands, we've been reluctant to really add a lot of marketing costs to these businesses. They are unique; they've got great strong value propositions. But I think in this environment, I think we finally come to grips with that we're probably going to have to spend a little bit more money and become -- and try to find which channels in the digital environment can work best for them. I think there's not one channel that would work across all our small brands. And so each of them are so unique, we have to figure out what's the best way to talk to the consumer. As far as off-premise, our third-party delivery for the smaller brands, I really don't see that as upside. We do have one of our tests in the majority of the Yard House's. We are using a provider. Just think about where Yard House is located. It's embedded in a lifestyle center with no parking and so it's more difficult even for the last-mile provider to get in there and pick up the food. So, it's not a big part of the business. So, I don't really think about that as a way to grow the business. I think that, we need to make really good long-term decisions. We've been able to protect our margins in these businesses. We've got to continue to innovate and make them attractive. We also have to recognize -- there's a lot of volatility in these businesses. And it goes back to -- if you open an another restaurant that looks like you are in the same development. It's going to have a one year impact on the comps. And we have that once in a while. These are great brands. We're going to, obviously, try to compete a little differently as we go forward. I wouldn't look for a big change here in the next couple of quarters because we're going to test and learn and we're going to do it responsively. These are strong business models and I'm not going to put the brands on sale to get a headline number. We're going to protect the overall business for the long-term.\nJohn Glass: Thank you. I'm sorry to belabor the value point on Olive Garden. I just want to make sure I understand this correctly. You spent last year reducing some of the couponing or discounting and reserving that value power if you needed in the future. Are you now suggesting you need that today, or is this still, it's in the reserve, but you are not really changing your view on increased value promotions in 2020 as it stands today?\nGene Lee: I mean as it stands today, I think, our position is exactly the same as it was the past couple of quarters that Olive Garden continues to perform extremely well, in over 300 basis points gap to the industry. We'll continue to look at each promotion, and what kind of support that promotion needs, depending what we're doing from a television standpoint. I do think that the analyst community and investor community is looking at things too much in isolation. And you don't have the whole picture of what's happening from overall media spend. And because we run a TBI or a TBI test, you read into a situation that things must be bad. I think that's not the way to look -- to analyze our business. It's just one of many levers that we have to pull to support our business. And right now I think, we're looking at the Olive Garden business as being competing extremely well in the environment.\nJohn Glass: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jake Bartlett from SunTrust. Your line is open.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. My question was about Cheddar's. And I'm wondering where you think you are now in the integration of the business, the turnaround of operations, the improvements and in the context of your acquisition and strategy going forward? Do you feel like you're in a position now, where you might get more active on acquisitions?\nGene Lee: Well, that's a two-part question. I think where are we on Cheddar's? I think today, I'm more optimistic than I've ever been. I think, as I acknowledge in my opening comments there\u2019s still a ton of work to do there. This is a high volume complex operation that has some operational challenges that aren't systemic. Where we have strong leadership and great human resource metrics, we're running great businesses. We have to stabilize some of these other businesses and start with getting that right General Manager in place, managing partner and then building a great team. So, I think that, I'm very encouraged; the HR metrics are really starting to improve. I'm encouraged that our operation metrics are improving. I'm encouraged that our controls are better today than ever. I'm encouraged that our restaurant is staffed. And I'm encouraged with the new insight that we've really uncovered that we've got a real awareness problem. And an awareness problem is with people within 10 miles of our restaurants. So I'm encouraged that we can solve that. But we're going to solve these problems for the long-term. We\u2019re going to build a strong foundation and we're going to do it right. This represents less than 8% of our overall business and I'm really resolute in the fact that I want to fix this and fix it right for the long-term. I think this is still a huge opportunity. And as much urgency as I'm putting behind it, I'm more concerned about doing it right. As far as M&A activity, I use a standard statement. But the management and the board are going to continue to look at opportunities to add to our portfolio when it's appropriate. And I really have no further comment on that at this point in time.\nJake Bartlett: Got it. And I had a follow-up question on your level of incentives and your approach to incentives. And your traffic has been negative the last two quarters at Olive Garden, obviously, outperforming the space significantly. As you look at that, are you focused more on the outperformance or your absolute level? And I'm kind of wondering how long you're going to -- you would kind of tolerate negative traffic versus kind of trying to insert more incentives to try to drive that positive?\nGene Lee: Yeah. First of all, let's look at the magnitude of the negative traffic. I mean half of the negative traffic that we reported last month is just due to catering delivery. And that piece of the off premise business grows -- we're not giving ourselves any guest counts for that. We're not doing that for multiple reasons. And we could go ahead and change our methodology and have positive traffic if we chose to do that. I think that when we look at traffic and we look at the overall business, there are going to be times that there's traffic available to you and it's worth driving. There are other times when you look at the business, and you say, I'm okay with losing 10, or 15, 20 guests a week and being able to protect our business model. And so, I don't think you can just have, let's do everything we can to grow traffic, or let's do everything we can to protect our business model. I think it all has to be done in balance. And I think our management teams and this leadership team have done an outstanding job over the last four years of really balancing these efforts.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Chris O\u2019Cull from Stifel. Your line is open.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning. First just a point of clarification and a question. Is the $5 Take Home entr\u00e9e promotion considered a new off premise transaction, or is it just an add-on to the dining check? And then, Gene, can you provide some more detail about how Cheddar's plans to broaden reach with its advertising? And when we might start to see that investment?\nGene Lee: Yeah. The $5 Take Home is an off premise transaction. And as far as Cheddar's goes, I mean, we're out there testing and learning with different digital vehicles to see and other traditional media to see what we can -- what kind of awareness we can generate with that. So we're out there at a small scale and we'll continue to increase that scale as we learn.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks. Gene, just a couple of questions on Cheddar's, can we just go back and talk about the guest satisfaction scores, may be direction that you're seeing there? Are those improving, or have those kind of started to go backwards? And then on the turnover at Cheddar's both manager and the crew level, are those -- how far are those off of Darden's average? How much more work is yet to be done there? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Good question, Peter. Guest satisfaction scores are increasing across the board as we've improved management, employee staffing and there is still opportunity there and I would say that the virgins, the differential between the better operating stores and the one for challenges is still too great and we've got to close that gap down. As far as turnover, the metrics are still outside Darden norms, but they are inside industry norms for the first time, which is I think is a really good trend. And it's going to take us a while to get them -- hopefully get them to Darden norms, but they are on their way and again inside industry trends at this point in time.\nPeter Saleh: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. One clarification first. Gene, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned the industry comps continued to weaken and then you did mention -- I'm just trying to gauge whether you think it\u2019s older to tough compare because I think that was what you mention initially as a rationale or whether you do see that there is some sort of change in the consumer behavior, because when you look at past couple of quarters, it seems like the two-year trend on comp and traffic seems relatively stable. So, maybe you're looking at broader industry data that we don't get a chance to see more holistically or whether you think it's again more just the two-year comp compare being more difficult or where there's actual change in the consumer?\nGene Lee: Well, I think that, I think it's a combination of both. I think that's what I was trying to allude to in the comment was that, the industry was facing some tougher comparison, but I think you all talked about that is that overall industry comparisons were little bit more difficult. But I think, what I was trying to get at is, we were surprised that it went all the way to negative. We thought that our view was to the industry would stay positive in this environment. It may not -- the growth rate would've come back just like, if you look at GDP growth, it's still strong, but it has decelerated. So, we were just I think a little surprised that the industry went all the way back to negative.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just want to talk about Cheddar's, I'm just wondering things like the under-the-hood metrics are getting better and you seem excited about the opportunity longer term. I was just wondering whether frustration on the sales in the short-term might lead you to delay when you would otherwise ramp-up the new unit growth which seem like that was the big opportunity over time, I'm just wondering whether that timeframe might have changed or have been pushed back at all?\nGene Lee: Only the timeframe has changed. I think we've been pretty consistent with our talking point around that is the biggest thing for a new unit ramp-up growth would be human resources and I'm not so sure that I haven't said that we won that battle yet. And so, every time you open a new restaurant, you make that investment, you got to have a great managing partner. And I don't think that we're there at that point yet that we can ramp-up growth. We're still doing five or six a year, which is the right number at this point in time. And I want -- I really want to see the management depth continue to build. And then when you get to that point that's when you can start to ramp-up growth. But I don't think that's -- we haven't given a timeline to that and I'm going to give a timeline today. I'm focused on really, really getting great managing partners in these restaurants. And I know when we do that our likelihood of success increases dramatically.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. No more questions at this time. Let me now hand the call over to Kevin Kalicak.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Ray. That concludes our call. I want to remind you all that we plan to release second quarter results on Thursday, December 19th before the market opens with conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today's call. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gene Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, we had a solid quarter. Total sales from continuing operations were $2.1 billion, an increase of 3.5%. Same-restaurant sales increased 0.9% and diluted net earnings per share were $1.38. Comparable same-restaurant sales for the industry continued to weaken during the quarter as the industry once again faced tougher comparisons. However, the industry comping negative is surprising considering unemployment remains at all-time low and there continues to be strong wage growth, which historically has been a positive for the industry. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, given the industry performance and their difficult comparisons over the first quarter of last year. We remain focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy and leveraging our four competitive advantages. And I'm pleased, we continued to take share and protect our margins. Turning to brand highlights for the quarter. Olive Garden had strong quarter, which resulted in its 20th consecutive quarter same-restaurant sales growth. Total sales grew 3.6%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 2.2% and 1.4% growth in new restaurants. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales gap to the industry was 340 basis points this quarter, representing the largest gap to the industry since the first quarter of fiscal 2019. And on a two-year basis Olive Garden grew total sales by nearly 10%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 840 basis points. Olive Garden's results were driven by the team's ongoing focus on flawless execution, everyday value, and convenience. Guest satisfaction ratings remain impressive, and catering delivery metrics reflect the highest intent to recommend within the brand giving us confidence that our teams are delivering great experiences inside and outside the four walls of our restaurants. The Olive Garden team made a strategic decision to change the order of their first quarter promotions. This was necessary to separate their two strongest value promotions; Buy One Take One, and Never Ending Pasta Bowl to more evenly deliver the value messaging throughout the year. While this change along with associated media shifts and weakening industry trends resulted in lower traffic than last year, it was the right strategic decision for the long term. Recognizing the strength of Buy One Take One promotion, Olive Garden added $5 take-home entre\u0301es to the Everyday value lineup, which was supported with national advertising to drive awareness. It has been met with strong guest demand, and it will be a catalyst to continue to grow the off-premise business. Everyday value was also strengthened with the introduction of a new weekday lunch menu with 21 options under $10, including guest favorites like Chicken Parmigiana and items from the Taste of the Mediterranean menu like Chicken Margarita. This initiative was supported by integrated marketing and resulted in stronger weekday lunch traffic and guest preference. Finally, the Olive Garden team remains focused on their off-premise capabilities to meet their guests' needs for convenience. A key part of that focus has been optimizing the digital sales channel for both mobile and desktop. During the quarter, digital sales grew by more than 30% and represented approximately 40% of to go sales. Overall, off-premise sales grew 12%, representing 14% of total sales. Olive Garden remains a truly iconic and broadly appealing brand and the team is doing an excellent job of focusing on this strategy and competing effectively. LongHorn Steakhouse had a strong quarter as well. Total sales grew 4.6%, driven by 2% growth from new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.6%, the 26th consecutive quarter of same-restaurant sales growth. On a two-year basis, LongHorn grew total sales by 11%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 940 basis points. The LongHorn team remains focused on their long-term strategy of investing in the quality of the guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution, and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement. During the quarter, the LongHorn team ran two successful menu promotions; Grill Master Favorite and Fire Crafted Flavors, which were supported by their award-winning You Can't Fake Steak advertising campaign. They also supported these promotions by reinforcing their quality story through multiple guest touch points. The team also continued to focus on ensuring the to go experience equals their in-restaurant experience for guests who choose this convenience. The team simplified the online ordering process, which significantly reduced the order time. During the quarter, digital sales grew almost 50% and represented more than one-third of total to go sales. Additionally, they have now completed a dedicated to go area in more than half of their restaurants. These actions led to continued improvement in guest satisfaction scores for order accuracy and timeliness and helped to drive to go sales growth nearly 12%. Finally, LongHorn's industry-leading retention rates continue to even get better despite the tight labor market. Team member turnover during the quarter was 68% compared to approximately 120% for casual dining, and management turnover during the quarter was 13% compared to approximately 36% for casual dining. We know that engaged team members provide better guest experiences, and the LongHorn team's ongoing focus on retention and culture building is a key driver of the strong business performance. Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen total sales decreased 2%, driven by same-restaurant sales decline of 5.4%, and partially offset by sales growth from new restaurants of 3.4%. The trend change was driven by reduced marketing efforts and overall industry softness in the quarter. In addition, the same-restaurant sales decline continued to be more pronounced in the former franchise locations. These restaurants experienced significant disruption during the quarter as they were the last restaurants to complete the kitchen transformation project. While it's disappointing to see the sales trend decline, the Cheddar's team made significant progress against their priorities during the quarter. At the beginning of the new fiscal year, they established three new strategic priorities; create a people focused results-oriented culture, reduce friction in the guest experience, and build a brand people talk about with the goal of building on the progress they made last year repairing [ph] fundamental elements of the business and improving the sales trajectory. During the quarter, the Cheddar's team continued to see improvements in both the manager and team member turnover trends as they implemented initiatives that led to higher retention levels. Overall, staffing levels for both the manager and team members improved during the quarter. Because of the progress made this quarter in staffing and intention, the Cheddar's team was able to better execute operational improvements designed to enhance the guest experience. For example, they implemented standard that significantly upgraded their abilities to successfully serve large parties. With these and other improvements, they saw a better guest experience results compared to last year across all key metrics. Near the end of the quarter, Cheddar's introduced the new menu with more price diversity within categories and they launched their Quick Pick Lunch Combos starting at $5.99. These combos are generating strong preference at lunch and have led to higher value and intend to return ratings compared to last year. I recognized there's still a lot of work to do, but the progress the Cheddar's team has made operationally and their improved HR metrics are encouraging. Now that they feel they're moving in the right direction from an operation and staffing perspective, they will begin to increase their working media spend. Cheddar's has the highest guest frequency of any Darden brand and this investment is intended to build upon the strong position, improve brand awareness and drive trial. They will be leveraging Darden resources and best practices to implement the media plan. Finally, during the quarter, we acquired four previously franchise restaurant locations in Texas, and I'm pleased to say that each of these four restaurants is performing at a very high level. In closing, I'm pleased with the progress our teams made executing against the strategic initiatives. Our strategy is working, allowing us to continue to grow sales, increased market share, improve margins and invest in our people and brands, all while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Of course, none of this would be possible of having the best people in the business, so I want to take this opportunity to thank you our 185,000 team members who continued to create memorable dining experiences for our guests. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. I'm not -- we're not going to get that granular with our spending in Cheddar's. I would just say that we now have enough transactional data to look at some things in Cheddar's we haven't had the opportunity to do before. And one of the big insights is that our frequency in Cheddar's is higher than any other Darden brand. And we married that up with some of the research that we were doing, and we recognized that our awareness for this brand is extremely low. And our primary advertising had been more driven towards a frequency play. And we decided, once we have this insight during the quarter, we were pulling -- we pulled back from that type of activity, and now we're going go out and we're going to test and learn and understand how to best increase our awareness in markets. We also recognize the fact that it's going to be more important than ever in this environment to continue to build out our markets, develop our -- become more efficient in those markets from a media standpoint, and I would say more -- use more traditional media to increase our awareness to drive this business. And so, it was a really good quarter from that -- from an insight standpoint for us to really recognize, and we decided we were going to change direction and that's where we pulled back a little bit of the media spend during the quarter. No, it's just the fact that we actually now have the transactional data to be able to analyze and have that insight. That's why it's so important when we do an acquisition for us to put our systems in, so that we can get the data and then do our analysis. Yeah. Good morning, David. As I said in my prepared remarks, the backdrop appears to be very strong for the consumer. We have good wage growth. We have strong employment. Historically, that's been really good for us. As we look at the data and we when look at behaviors, when we look at confidence I have -- I personally believe that there's some uncertainty entering into the consumer, and it's impacting their confidence. How long? I've got to believe there with all the media attention around what's happening, how long does this continue -- this environment continue? So, there's nothing structural that we see that's changed out there other than there appears to be a little bit more uncertainty today than there was in the future. As far as what do we need to do? We need to continue to create compelling guest experiences and come up with -- and reinforce our value propositions. I do think that we have to think about how we're going to market in our smaller brands and how do we advertise those brands in different channels and become more effective and compete more effectively? I think that's an important change that we need to make in the upcoming quarters. I think we have the luxury of being patient and test and learn and really make great long-term decisions as we try to figure out how to support those brands and compete more effectively in this marketplace. We're pleased that we're heading into Never Ending Pasta Bowl in Olive Garden, it's a great promotion for us. We had a lot of buzz around our Pasta Pass this year. And so, I think it's a good promotion going into this time of year and where the consumer's at. Well, I guess, we reiterated our guidance today. We believe our same restaurant sales for the year will be somewhere between 1% and 2%. No. I really don't have a lot to add to your question. We've really not seen much from a geographic standpoint and there's really been no trend change to any of the weekday, weekday night, weekday lunch or a weekend business. I would say that, the trends have weakened in all areas of the business. I think, the biggest thing our teams are doing is, they're taking friction out of the process. And, I think, we're getting -- it's like anything else, repetition is a great thing. You continued to get better and better with it, as you do more business. So, I think LongHorn has made tremendous progress. We've seen their scores go up, their satisfaction scores go up. Olive Garden has really honed in on this process. They continue to find ways. Very, very impressed with the digital growth in both of those businesses. We think that's something to continue to look at. So to me, it's really about making that experience as compelling as we possibly can with great value, right. I think, it's -- and that's been our strategy is, to make sure that we have strong value on the off premise and not have the consumer be willing to come pick it up, versus it being delivered. We could try. No, Brett. No, we haven't seen any change at all. And -- when I look at the quarter -- let me put it back to look at the quarter. Let's think about what Olive Garden has done in the last two years. Even though the industry has weakened, I'm incredibly impressed that we've grown our business approximately 10% at Olive Garden with two-year comp that I think is extremely impressive. And so the industry and a lot of the comments that I made today about the industry decelerating, I look at our two large brands; I think they're competing very effectively. The gaps are very, very strong to the industry. So, I think we have a way to compete very effectively with these two brands and I'm excited. And yes, we watch the industry and we give you some insight to it, but our job and our leaders' jobs are to find a way to compete effectively in any environment and I think that's what our teams have done really well in this first quarter. John, you get the award for most questions inside a one question. I got independence, I got discount. What was the first? Where are people are going. John we are definitely seeing some strength in limited service both fast casual and quick-serve, there's no doubt about that. And you think about there is good income growth on the lower end of the curve and those folks seem to be trading or dining out a little bit more frequently. And I don't know where people are trading out of in casual when you look at a 10-year period, that's been a big question. I'm not sure we've had -- we as an industry, you have an answer. Again, we focused on our brands and we seem to be getting more than our fair share. The data that we're looking at is saying that large chains are still taking more share and they're taking that share from independence. Where you see independence and small regional change are in really what I would call the better, better trade areas, the higher income trade areas, where they are having an impact and I think performing well. But I think on a national scale, when you look at it, independence are still donating share and large brands continue to do better and take share from both smaller probably a little bit older brands and independents. As far as discounting, we're going to continue to use, whatever levers we can use to grow our business. When you look at -- when we look at incentives, we don't look at just as one piece. We have to look at our overall advertising program. What is going on from a television standpoint, what's going on from a digital and online, what are we doing from an incentive standpoint. We have multiple ways to put incentives out there. And so we have a lot of leverage that we can pull over time depending on the environment. And we will use those appropriately to drive our business in a profitable way. The one thing that, I think that we are proud of, and I'm very proud of our teams is that we continue to drive our business, while protecting our margins. And we continue to invest in our business, invest in quality, invest in food, invest in portion size, invest in our people, and we're able to do that in a way that has protected our margins. And as Rick talked about, our plus 8% EBIT margins are incredibly impressive in this environment. And so when we think about incentives, we think about it holistically and all that we're doing to build our brands over the long-term. No. We haven't -- we really haven't -- have any -- thoughts haven't evolved at all. We will acknowledge that the cost burden does appear to be shifting from the company to the consumer, and we are going to watch that closely. But I think -- I have a lot of concerns about that. This is still -- we're still -- it's all about value and how much of the overall experience are you willing to dedicate towards convenience? And so it's something to watch. It's definitely a shift that we internally predicted that would happen. And we'll watch it, but I want to pivot back to what I said earlier, our job is to create a compelling off-premise experience right now that -- with so much value that consumer is willing to come and get it. That seems to be working for us and we're going to continue to focus on that. No, I think they're similar, but different. And so there are different types of value offering and our team will continue to reenergize Buy One Take One, it's an important part of our value proposition. And if it's done right, it will continue to support the $5 take-home. It shouldn't be a cannibalistic thing. It should -- it really should support it and move it after you run Buy One Take One that should be the springboard for a $5 take-home for the rest of the year and you can reenergize the promotion each year. So, that's how we're thinking about that. So, it should be additive not -- it shouldn't be dilutive at all. Well, it's an interesting concept John. As you think about the smaller brands, we've been reluctant to really add a lot of marketing costs to these businesses. They are unique; they've got great strong value propositions. But I think in this environment, I think we finally come to grips with that we're probably going to have to spend a little bit more money and become -- and try to find which channels in the digital environment can work best for them. I think there's not one channel that would work across all our small brands. And so each of them are so unique, we have to figure out what's the best way to talk to the consumer. As far as off-premise, our third-party delivery for the smaller brands, I really don't see that as upside. We do have one of our tests in the majority of the Yard House's. We are using a provider. Just think about where Yard House is located. It's embedded in a lifestyle center with no parking and so it's more difficult even for the last-mile provider to get in there and pick up the food. So, it's not a big part of the business. So, I don't really think about that as a way to grow the business. I think that, we need to make really good long-term decisions. We've been able to protect our margins in these businesses. We've got to continue to innovate and make them attractive. We also have to recognize -- there's a lot of volatility in these businesses. And it goes back to -- if you open an another restaurant that looks like you are in the same development. It's going to have a one year impact on the comps. And we have that once in a while. These are great brands. We're going to, obviously, try to compete a little differently as we go forward. I wouldn't look for a big change here in the next couple of quarters because we're going to test and learn and we're going to do it responsively. These are strong business models and I'm not going to put the brands on sale to get a headline number. We're going to protect the overall business for the long-term. I mean as it stands today, I think, our position is exactly the same as it was the past couple of quarters that Olive Garden continues to perform extremely well, in over 300 basis points gap to the industry. We'll continue to look at each promotion, and what kind of support that promotion needs, depending what we're doing from a television standpoint. I do think that the analyst community and investor community is looking at things too much in isolation. And you don't have the whole picture of what's happening from overall media spend. And because we run a TBI or a TBI test, you read into a situation that things must be bad. I think that's not the way to look -- to analyze our business. It's just one of many levers that we have to pull to support our business. And right now I think, we're looking at the Olive Garden business as being competing extremely well in the environment. Well, that's a two-part question. I think where are we on Cheddar's? I think today, I'm more optimistic than I've ever been. I think, as I acknowledge in my opening comments there's still a ton of work to do there. This is a high volume complex operation that has some operational challenges that aren't systemic. Where we have strong leadership and great human resource metrics, we're running great businesses. We have to stabilize some of these other businesses and start with getting that right General Manager in place, managing partner and then building a great team. So, I think that, I'm very encouraged; the HR metrics are really starting to improve. I'm encouraged that our operation metrics are improving. I'm encouraged that our controls are better today than ever. I'm encouraged that our restaurant is staffed. And I'm encouraged with the new insight that we've really uncovered that we've got a real awareness problem. And an awareness problem is with people within 10 miles of our restaurants. So I'm encouraged that we can solve that. But we're going to solve these problems for the long-term. We're going to build a strong foundation and we're going to do it right. This represents less than 8% of our overall business and I'm really resolute in the fact that I want to fix this and fix it right for the long-term. I think this is still a huge opportunity. And as much urgency as I'm putting behind it, I'm more concerned about doing it right. As far as M&A activity, I use a standard statement. But the management and the board are going to continue to look at opportunities to add to our portfolio when it's appropriate. And I really have no further comment on that at this point in time. Yeah. First of all, let's look at the magnitude of the negative traffic. I mean half of the negative traffic that we reported last month is just due to catering delivery. And that piece of the off premise business grows -- we're not giving ourselves any guest counts for that. We're not doing that for multiple reasons. And we could go ahead and change our methodology and have positive traffic if we chose to do that. I think that when we look at traffic and we look at the overall business, there are going to be times that there's traffic available to you and it's worth driving. There are other times when you look at the business, and you say, I'm okay with losing 10, or 15, 20 guests a week and being able to protect our business model. And so, I don't think you can just have, let's do everything we can to grow traffic, or let's do everything we can to protect our business model. I think it all has to be done in balance. And I think our management teams and this leadership team have done an outstanding job over the last four years of really balancing these efforts. Yeah. The $5 Take Home is an off premise transaction. And as far as Cheddar's goes, I mean, we're out there testing and learning with different digital vehicles to see and other traditional media to see what we can -- what kind of awareness we can generate with that. So we're out there at a small scale and we'll continue to increase that scale as we learn. Good question, Peter. Guest satisfaction scores are increasing across the board as we've improved management, employee staffing and there is still opportunity there and I would say that the virgins, the differential between the better operating stores and the one for challenges is still too great and we've got to close that gap down. As far as turnover, the metrics are still outside Darden norms, but they are inside industry norms for the first time, which is I think is a really good trend. And it's going to take us a while to get them -- hopefully get them to Darden norms, but they are on their way and again inside industry trends at this point in time. Well, I think that, I think it's a combination of both. I think that's what I was trying to allude to in the comment was that, the industry was facing some tougher comparison, but I think you all talked about that is that overall industry comparisons were little bit more difficult. But I think, what I was trying to get at is, we were surprised that it went all the way to negative. We thought that our view was to the industry would stay positive in this environment. It may not -- the growth rate would've come back just like, if you look at GDP growth, it's still strong, but it has decelerated. So, we were just I think a little surprised that the industry went all the way back to negative. Only the timeframe has changed. I think we've been pretty consistent with our talking point around that is the biggest thing for a new unit ramp-up growth would be human resources and I'm not so sure that I haven't said that we won that battle yet. And so, every time you open a new restaurant, you make that investment, you got to have a great managing partner. And I don't think that we're there at that point yet that we can ramp-up growth. We're still doing five or six a year, which is the right number at this point in time. And I want -- I really want to see the management depth continue to build. And then when you get to that point that's when you can start to ramp-up growth. But I don't think that's -- we haven't given a timeline to that and I'm going to give a timeline today. I'm focused on really, really getting great managing partners in these restaurants. And I know when we do that our likelihood of success increases dramatically."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. We had another good quarter with total sales growth of 3.5%, driven by 2.6% growth from the addition of 40 net new restaurants and same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%. First quarter diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.38, an increase of 3% from last year's diluted net earnings per share. We paid $108 million in dividends and repurchased $95 million in shares, returning over $200 million to shareholders this quarter. Before I get into the detailed results from this quarter, I want to mention that we adopted the new accounting standard for leases at the beginning of this fiscal year. Consistent with the expectation discussed on last quarter's call, we estimate that this will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.05 in fiscal 2020. However, the more meaningful impact was to our balance sheet, as you saw from this morning's press release. This quarter, we also updated our segment reporting. Beginning in fiscal 2020, our calculation of segment profit now excludes non-cash real estate related expenses and fiscal 2019 has been restated for comparability. This change allows for more consistent evaluation of our business across segments and fiscal periods. Now turning to our detailed margin results. Food and beverage costs were flat to last year, as pricing of 2% and continued cost savings initiatives offset commodity inflation of approximately 1.5% and continued investments. I'm impressed with restaurant labor being flat to last year, particularly in light of same-restaurant sales growth of 0.9%. Total labor inflation of 4% was offset by pricing, check mix and productivity improvements in new and existing restaurants. Restaurant expense was unfavorable 10 basis points due to deleverage, as our comp sales growth was below inflation. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin of 18.1% was 10 basis points unfavorable to last year. General and administrative expense was 50 basis points lower than last year and favorable mark-to-market expense, which is generally offset in the tax line, lower management incentive expense and sales leverage. Our Q1 effective tax rate of 9.8% was slightly below the range in our annual guidance. We still anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11% for the fiscal year. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter and impressed with our strong EAT margin of 8.1%. Turning to our segment performance. Olive Garden grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin increased 40 basis points, by leveraging the same-restaurant sales growth and managing cost-effectively. LongHorn also grew sales and profit in the quarter, driven by positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin decreased slightly, due to elevated beef inflation and continued investments during the quarter. Fine Dining grew sales and profit in the quarter as well, driven by a positive same-restaurant sales and net new restaurant growth. Segment profit margin decreased because of higher pre-opening expense and inefficiencies related to three new restaurants. Sales for our Other Business segment grew 1.8%, driven by net new restaurants. Both segment profit dollars and margin decreased this quarter due to margin deleverage from negative same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter. As you saw in the press release, we reiterated all aspects of our fiscal 2020 outlook. Looking ahead at our second quarter performance, there are two things I would like to address before we open up the call for questions. Both of which are contemplated in our annual guidance. First, the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday this year, relative to last, is shifting from the second quarter, into the third quarter. Since we are closed in the majority of our restaurants on this day, this shift should positively impact Darden's second quarter same-restaurant sales, by approximately 80 to 100 basis points with a corresponding offset in the third quarter. Second, given a prolonged media coverage and the storms duration, Hurricane Dorian had a meaningful impact on the first two weeks of our fiscal second quarter. We are currently estimating a drag of 20 to 30 basis points to same-restaurant sales in the second quarter. And with that, we'll take your questions. Andrew, this is Rick. The price was 2.2%, I believe in the first quarter and that's just due to timing of pricing year-over-year. We still expect our price to be below 2%, which is our long-term goal to keep pricing below our inflation and below our competitors to increase our value perception in the marketplace, while still making great investments. So, yes, this was just a little bit of a timing anomaly for the quarter. Hey, Stephen, this is Rick again. Thanks for the question. As you said, yes, we have our loyalty program in about 7% of our restaurants and that -- across the nation. We're still monitoring that test. As we have said quite a few times, this is going to take a long time to understand the frequency driving nature of the loyalty program and how much we'd have to provide discounts to our most loyal consumers to come to us, versus other incentives for them to come. The test is going okay. It's going well, but we're not ready to pull the trigger on adding more restaurants. We're going nationally. And when we do, I am sure all of you will be to first to know. But, right now, we're kind of holding steady on our test. The fact that it's still out there, tells you that it's not going well, but we want to just make sure that it's the right thing to do in the long run, as part of what Gene says, our overall strategy of how do we market to our consumers. Yes. Two things, I think, that will probably drive mix maybe a little bit above our target will be continued growth in catering and catering delivery and the addition of the $5 Take Homes. Those two things probably are going to drive that mix slightly above our long-term expectations. The $5 Take Home is a great value offering and it's something that we think is a real catalyst to continue to drive the off premise business, which should have a little bit more of a positive mix than what we want to try to do for a long-term. No. We're not going to talk about the second quarter impact. And we shifted some media; we moved things around, which is always going to move our comparisons somewhat. But I'll go back to my statement; this was something we think strategically needed to be done. And -- again, I would also add this also always shifts in our media spending, as we -- it's the only way you can really discern what is working and what is not working and what -- and where to put more weight against, whether it's promotion or lunch or value is that you have to change the media spend to learn. And so we shifted a little bit inside the quarter. I wouldn't get caught up in that I point back to a great two-year stack great our performance in the industry. We made a strategic -- a big strategic choice to separate the two value promotions that gives us more balance in our value messaging throughout the year, which is really important. Let's not get hung up on a week-to-week media shifts."

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, President and COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of those measurements are included in the presentation. Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing fourth quarter performance as a comparison to our fourth quarter of fiscal '19 and the annual reference to pre-COVID is the trailing 12 months, ending February of fiscal '20. This is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic impact on the business as dining rooms closed and we pivoted to go only model during the fourth quarter of fiscal '20. We plan to release fiscal '22 first quarter earnings on September 23 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks, Rick will give an update on our operating performance, and Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for fiscal '22. Now I'll turn the call over to Gene.\nGene Lee: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, we had a very strong quarter that exceeded our expectations as sales quickly accelerated from the third quarter. During our call a year ago, I talked about the resiliency of the full-service dining segment and the confidence we had in the industry's ability to bounce back from the impacts of the pandemic, and we've begun to see demand come back at strong levels. As we think about the industry, our consumer insights team has done a lot of good work to better understand the size of the full-service dining segment. There are multiple sources of data that offers sales estimates for the restaurant industry, and the size of the industry and the full-service industry, specifically varies considerably across these sources. This year, we are adopting Technomic as our data source, which we believe better reflects the sales contribution from independent operators, provides a broader view of the restaurant industry, and aligns more closely with the census data. Going forward, we will be referencing industry data provided by Technomic, which sizes the casual dining and fine dining categories for fiscal 2020 at $189 billion and for fiscal 2019 at $222 billion. Given the strong demand we're seeing in the financial health of the consumer, we believe the categories will return to that size or greater despite having approximately 10% fewer units than before the onset of the pandemic. Over the last 15 months, we have made numerous strategic investments. At the restaurant level, we've invested in food quality and portion size that will help strengthen long-term value perceptions for each brand. We also made considerable investments in our team members to ensure our employment proposition remains a competitive advantage. And we invested in technology, particularly within our To Go capabilities, to meet our guests' growing need for convenience and desire for the off-premise experience. Our business model has evolved and is much stronger today. As we begin our new fiscal year, we will remain disciplined in our approach to growing sales, more specifically, our focus is on driving profitable sales growth. Given the business transformation work we have done and the demand we are seeing from the consumer, we are well positioned to thrive in this operating environment. Before I turn it over to Rick, I want to say thank you to our team members in our restaurants and our support center. This was, without a doubt, the most challenging year in our company's history, but thanks to your dedication and perseverance, we have emerged stronger. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the senior leadership team, thank you for all you do to take care of our guests and each other. Rick?\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Our results this quarter are a combination of the business model transformation work that Gene referenced as well as the simplification efforts we implemented throughout the year. Significant process and menu simplification at each brand has enabled us to drive high levels of execution and strengthen margins, further positioning our brands for long-term success. As we began the quarter, our restaurant teams remained disciplined, while continuing to operate in a difficult and unpredictable environment. As restrictions continue to ease and dine-in traffic increased, our teams successfully managed through it, thanks to their focus on being brilliant with the basics, ensuring we provided great food with outstanding service in an enjoyable atmosphere for all of our guests. This enabled us to deliver record-setting results. For example, Olive Garden broke its all-time, single-day sales record on Mother's Day. Additionally, both Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse achieved the highest quarterly segment profit in their history. Even as capacity restrictions eased and we were able to utilize more of our dining rooms, off-premise sales remained strong during the quarter. Off-premise sales accounted for 33% of total sales at Olive Garden, 19% at LongHorn, and 16% at Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Guest demand for off-premise has been stickier than we originally thought, and this is driven by the focus of our restaurant teams and the investments we made to improve our digital platform throughout the year. Technology enhancements to online ordering and the introduction of new capabilities such as To Go capacity management and Curbside I'm Here notification, improves the experience for our guests, while making it easier for our operators to execute. As a result, during the quarter, 64% of Olive Garden's to-go orders were placed online and 14% of Darden's total sales were digital transactions. Thanks to additional technology enhancements, we continue to see guests utilize our digital tools even when they were dining in our restaurants. Nearly half of all guest checks were scheduled digitally either online on our tabletop tablets or via mobile pay. The business model improvements we have made also reinforced our ability to open value-creating new restaurants across all of our brands. During the quarter, we opened 14 new restaurants, and these restaurants are outperforming our expectations. While Raj will discuss specific new restaurant targets for fiscal '22, we are working to develop a pipeline of restaurants and future leaders that would put us at the higher end of our long-term framework of 2% to 3% sales growth from new units as we enter fiscal 2023. Finally, the strength of the Darden platform has helped our brands navigate near-term external challenges. The employment environment has been an issue for the industry. However, the power of our employment proposition strengthened by the investments we have in our people, continue to pay off as we retain our best talent and recruit new team members to more fully staff our restaurants. So, while there are staffing challenges in some areas, we are not experiencing systematic issues. Additionally, the strength of our platform has helped us avoid significant supply chain interruptions. Our supply chain team continues to leverage our scale to ensure our restaurant teams have the key products they need to serve our guests. Notably, the few spot outages we have experienced are related to warehouse staffing and driver shortages, not product availability. To wrap up, I also want to recognize our outstanding team members. During my restaurant visits, I'm inspired by the positive attitude and flexibility you demonstrate every day. Thank you for all you have done and continue to do to deliver great experiences for our guests. Now, I'll turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.3 billion, 79.5% higher than last year, driven by 90.4% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 30 net new restaurants, partially offset by one less week of operations this year. The improvements we made to our business model, combined with fourth quarter sales accelerating faster than cost, drove strong profitability, resulting in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.03. Our reported earnings were $0.76 higher due to a nonrecurring tax benefit of $99.7 million. This benefit primarily relates to our estimated federal net operating loss for fiscal year 2021, which will carry back to the preceding five years. Looking at our performance throughout the quarter, we saw same-restaurant sales versus pre-COVID improving from negative 4.1% in March to positive 2.4% in May. And same-restaurant sales for the first three weeks of June were 2.5% compared to two years ago. To Go sales for Olive Garden and LongHorn continue to be significantly higher than pre-COVID levels. We have seen a gradual decline in weekly To Go sales. However, that decline is being more than offset by an increase in dine-in sales. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L. Compared to pre-COVID results, food and beverage expenses were 90 basis points higher, driven by investments in both food quality and pricing below inflation. For reference, food inflation in Q4 was 4.3% versus last year. Restaurant labor was 190 basis points lower, driven by hourly labor improvement of 320 basis points due to efficiencies gained from the operation simplification and was partially offset by continued wage pressures. Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 200 basis points of favorability. G&A expense was 30 basis points lower, driven primarily by savings from the corporate restructuring earlier in the year. As a result, we achieved record restaurant level EBITDA margin for Darden of 22.6%, 310 basis points above pre-COVID levels and record quarterly EBITDA of $412 million. We had $5 million in impairments due to the write-off of multiple restaurant-related assets. And our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12%, excluding the impact of the non-recurring tax benefit I previously mentioned. Looking at our segments. We achieved record segment profit dollars and margins at Olive Garden, LongHorn and the other business segment this quarter. Fine Dining improved segment profit margins versus pre-COVID despite sales decline. These results were driven by reduced labor and marketing expenses as we continue to focus on simplified operations, while also continuing to invest in food quality and pricing below inflation. 2021 was a year like no other. And despite the challenges of constantly shifting capacity restrictions an uncertain guest demand, we delivered $7.2 billion in total sales. The actions we took in response to COVID-19 to solidify our cash position and transform our business model helped build solid foundation for recovery and resulted in over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $920 million of free cash flow results. As a result, we repaid our term loan, reinstated our pre-COVID dividend and quickly built up our cash position. Our disciplined approach to simplifying operations and driving profitable sales growth positions us well for the future. As a result of our strong performance, cash position and the fiscal 2022 outlook, this morning, we also announced our Board approved a 25% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share, implying an annual dividend of $4.40. This results in a yield of 3.2% based on yesterday's closing share price. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022, we assume full operating capacity for essentially all restaurants, and we do not anticipate any significant business interruptions related to COVID-19. Based on these assumptions, we expect total sales of $9.2 billion to $9.5 billion, representing growth of 5% to 8% from pre-COVID levels, same-restaurant sales growth of 25% to 29% and 35 to 40 new restaurants. Capital spending of $375 million to $425 million; total inflation of approximately 3%, with commodities inflation of approximately 2.5% and hourly labor inflation of approximately 6%; EBITDA of $1.5 billion to $1.59 billion; an annual effective tax rate of 13% to 14% and approximately $131 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in a diluted net earnings per share between $7 and $7.50. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. Gene, you stated that Darden is well positioned to thrive in this operating environment, and I think that's just a pretty powerful statement given all the labor challenges and cost issues that we're hearing from all of your peers. What is your reaction to these dynamics and why specifically do you believe Darden is standing out from the crowd as it relates to the near-term impacts from these issues?\nGene Lee: Well, let's start with -- on the labor front. I mean, we've made significant investments over time in our people starting way back when we had the tax reform. We made the choice to invest in our people at that point in time. We've invested in our people throughout the pandemic. Our best people have stayed with us through this. We have an attractive employment proposition. We're able to attract people to our businesses to work for us. We think that we're fairly well staffed right now, and as the environment continues to improve, we see no reason why we're not the employer of choice in our businesses. I've been pretty clear saying, I think the restaurant industry is going to continue to struggle attracting workers, but there's enough great hospitality workers out there to staff all Darden restaurants if we provide the best employment proposition. And not just an employment proposition today, it's about potential growth. Our ability to promote from within, we're promoting 1,000 team members a year into management. We\u2019re providing other opportunities through training and going out and opening new restaurants. I think our team members really love the experience. And so, I think that we're in great shape from an employment standpoint. We'll continue to invest. We'll manage -- we'll do a great salary administration to ensure that we're paying competitive wages, and I think that we have the flexibility to manage the wage inflation because of our margin structure. And combined with our pricing philosophy, I think we have some room there if need be to offset that and to be able to increase wages if we need to. As far as food inflation goes, I mean, our team has done a fantastic job. We're fairly long on the things that we need to be long on, and I think using our platform and our scale to our advantage through this has been a big advantage, and we feel like we're very well positioned to manage whatever inflation comes our way in the near term and even in the long term.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks Gene. And just a quick follow-up for Raj. We're no longer talking about 90% sales recapture, thankfully. We're on the other side of this. It feels in your guidance for '22 is 5% to 8% above pre-COVID level. So, obviously, over 100% recapture. And I believe the EBITDA margins at the midpoint of that guidance are 16.5%, so 250 basis points above pre-COVID. So what is the philosophy on communicating investments to us now and the philosophy on communicating how you're thinking about EBITDA margins now that this path for sales above pre-COVID levels is so much more clear?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Brian, I think as we look at where our guidance is, let me just start with that. When you think about what we guided this morning for fiscal 2022, that implies EBITDA margin growth of between 200 on the lower end to 250 on the higher end. And so clearly, our sales have recovered. The -- some of the flow-through we're letting it flow to the bottom line. But we have made some investments -- continue to make investments. And as Gene mentioned, we are pricing well below inflation. In fact, I think this morning, we said we expect overall inflation to be around 3%, and our pricing is in the middle of our one to two target. So we are pricing well below inflation. That's the biggest investment we're making, but it also gives us some extra dry powder if there was additional inflation that was to come our way. So, we do think the $200 million to $250 million is a good target for us now, but as we think beyond that, I think we need to better understand the economic and competitive environment as we hone in on the business model. And I would say based on where we are today, we expect to retain most of that margin improvement we'll see in FY '22.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nEric Gonzalez: Thanks for question. My question is on the inflation outlook. Clearly, there have been some big moves in commodities in recent weeks. Can you talk about some of the key variables included in that 3% inflation? I think you said 2.5% on the food side, and perhaps how that might stage throughout the year? Do you expect inflation to be higher in the beginning of the fiscal year before perhaps leveling out towards the end?\nRaj Vennam: Hi, Eric. So yes, as you look at inflation, we said commodities is around 2.5% for the full year. But it is -- the front half of the year is somewhere between 3.5% to 4% and then it is a little bit -- it tapers off a little bit as we go into the back. And as I said in my prepared remarks, Q4 this year was 4.3%, which implies -- which is where we think as we wsrap on next year, we expect Q4 to be more closer to flat. And so that's kind of the cadence. And then about the drivers of commodity inflation, I'd say chicken and seafood are high, and we\u2019re also seeing significant inflation in cooking oil, a little bit in dairy, and I'd say the other thing is packaging. Packaging continues to be -- especially with the resin costs going up, packaging is another factor. So all in all, those are the big drivers of inflation on the commodity side. And on the labor side, overall labor, we expect to be somewhere between 4%, 4.5%. But wage rate itself, we expect that to be around 6%.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. I'm wondering related to Olive Garden or perhaps your overall sales, how much do you think capacity constraints are still in play in terms of weighing down the performance? And I guess, relatedly, what do you think the upside is, Gene, as you see the restaurants come back to full capacity now that you're seeing some of these To Go sales stick more than you thought they would?\nGene Lee: Yes, David. Good morning. It is very limited capacity restrictions out there. There are still a few states and municipalities that have some restrictions on us, but we\u2019ve got California back last week and we got New York back. So, there's no major market that has restrictions. I think that when we think about where we're at from a sales perspective, we think there's still more room inside the restaurants as we continue to work on -- we think the work we do with our menus and our business model are going to help us with throughput, which is going to enable us to, in these high-volume periods, get more volume to the restaurant. I think Rick's commented in his prepared remarks about what the teams were able to do and execute on Mother's Day to have the biggest -- the best Mother's Day we've ever had before. It says a lot about our ability to execute and get more people through our restaurants in a limited time period. So I don't think we have any capacity restrictions. Obviously, we're seeing less sales growth on the weekends than when we are mid-week just because there's less opportunity in a lot of our high-volume restaurants to get through extra volume. So I mean there's still -- the word I use a lot is we're still in search equilibrium, and we're not there yet. And I don't know when we're going to be there when we see consumers really get into what I would call a normative behavior pattern, and we kind of get to where we understand what the in-restaurant dining is going to be, what the off-premise is going to be. Rick in his comments talk about that we're pleased with where the off-premise is leveling out, even though it's declining slightly. And I said this a while ago, and I think you guys -- a lot of you guys disagree with me. I think you were right and I was wrong that some of this off-premise was stickier than what we thought. And I think a lot has to do with the capabilities we created through the pandemic to make it a lot less frictionless. But we're searching for equilibrium, understanding when and where the business is going to come from. I think we're still in the early innings of that. I think we still got a lot more upside.\nDavid Tarantino: Thanks for that Gene. And then I guess one other follow-up question on this point is the gap between how LongHorn is performing and how Olive Garden is performing relative to pre-COVID is very significant. I was wondering if you could give your thoughts on why either LongHorn is outperforming by so much or Olive Garden is kind of lagging the performance you're seeing for LongHorn?\nGene Lee: Well, first thing I would say is Olive Garden is not lagging. I mean I'm just thrilled with their performance. When you're looking at 25.5 restaurant level margins and getting back to pre-COVID sales levels, that's just amazing. That performance is unbelievable. When you look at what's going on in LongHorn, we've been investing in that business for five years since Todd's come back. And he and his team have just done a great job of improving the value perception. When we look at where they are in Technomic and the ratings, they are number one in most categories. They moved from middle of the pack to number one. And so I think LongHorn's performance is just a culmination of a lot of work over a great period of time. And I also -- I want to also recognize that the whole Steakhouse segment is moving. The whole Steakhouse segment has outperformed the other segments, and I believe that's has outperformed the other segments, and I believe that's perceptions. So they're definitely getting a segment lift, but they've also done a great job and they're executing at an extremely high level.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two quick ones, actually. The first one, just on the first quarter as we now seemingly exit, hopefully, the pandemic. I think you said June, your month-to-date comps are up 2.5%. I think that's actually identical to what you said for May. I'm just wondering how does that compare to expectation whether you would have expected further acceleration with additional markets, like you said, having recently reopened? Or any kind of thoughts you can give us having given us full year guidance? Just wondering, I want to make sure with this being the first quarter of lapping full COVID? Any thoughts on those sales or whether there's any parameter around the earnings that you want us to think about? And then one follow-up.\nRaj Vennam: Jeff, this is Raj. So when you think about the cadence, I mean, I think May to June, I mean, it's three weeks, 2.5%. That's -- we feel pretty good about where we are on that in terms of same-restaurant sales. I would argue they are actually a little bit better than what we had expected going into the fiscal year. And then as you look at the cadence of some of as the markets open up as the capacity restrictions are lifted, we are seeing some movement, especially in California and places like that. But when you blend everything at the Darden level, some of these brands that are impacted the most are brands that are not a big portion -- playing a big part of our overall portfolio. So, it takes a lot to move the needle on our blended same-restaurant sales. And then there are other factors you got to take into consideration, especially, as you look at versus fiscal '19, because we're not doing some of the promotional activity. We're not doing things that would have stimulated demand in the past that we're doing now, right? So there is that we are basically comparing to a level that was different when we had a lot more spend in marketing and other stuff. But as Gene said, I think the continuation of the same team that we are thrilled with where we are, and we're also thrilled with our business model. However -- and the fact that we're able to make investments not only our people, but also in our guests through food quality, food portion and pricing. So we're giving a lot back to the guests, while actually getting a strong business model. And so I think that's how I would, I guess, address the question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. And then just my follow-up, just wondering as you think about fiscal '22, what do you think is the greatest risk? I mean seemingly, you're feeling quite good about current quarter-to-date trends and thriving in the outlook commentary. But in terms of risks to fiscal '22, would you say it's more on the sales or the cost side? Maybe where you think yourself and/or the industry would be most vulnerable as we come out on the other side? Thank you.\nGene Lee: I think the greatest risk still is COVID. I mean I think we're getting to the point where we think we're getting to the other side of that. But when I look at what we've put out there for guidance and I think that -- I think we -- obviously, we think we can achieve that. But I look at the greatest risk as being external, not internal, and I don't see risk from a sales perspective or a cost perspective. I think we've got the flexibility, and we've set this up to have the flexibility to deal with almost anything that is thrown at us, with the exception of another outbreak in COVID, where we had to have some restrictions on our business. To me, that's the greatest risk to what we look for.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets.\nChris Carril: Good morning and thanks for the question. So just in looking at the segment margins, holding aside the performance at Olive Garden and LongHorn, the other business segment margin was particularly strong and well above 2019. So curious to hear what some of the key drivers of the performance were in that segment? And maybe how much of a factor that segment's improvement is contributing to your '22 outlook? And I know last quarter you had discussed the improvement at Cheddar's, so any additional color or update there would be great as well?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. So I think as we look at our -- Chris, as we look at the other segment, I'd point out a couple of the brands -- business model transformation was significant. I'll say Cheddar's is a big part of that and Bahama Breeze in another brand where we saw a significant improvement in the business model. And part of this is going back to the simplification. We had a chance to kind of break down everything, rebuild back up and kind of figure out a way to transform the business model. So those two brands are primarily contributing to the significant growth we have in the other segment. And as we look at next fiscal year, they still play a decent role, right? I mean when you look at the other segment, it's about 20% of it. So they're not going to be a huge contributor. But related to their size, they are going to be outperforming on the segment margin.\nGene Lee: Yes, Chris, on Cheddar's, I would just say that we're extremely pleased with this business at this point. As Raj indicated, the biggest improvement in the business model in all of our business came in Cheddar's. We continue to focus on strengthening the restaurant leadership teams to be able to handle the future growth. But overall, we're very pleased with where this business is at today and very excited about the potential.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of James Rutherford with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJames Rutherford: I wanted to start off with a technology question for Rick. Last quarter, you mentioned being in the middle of developing a new three-year road map for technology. And I wanted -- I was curious if you -- where you expect to see the biggest returns, whether it's consumer-facing in the box, online, back-of-the-house support center or in some other area? I mean where are the biggest opportunities and priorities for the next three years on the tech side?\nGene Lee: Yes, James, thanks for the question. We have completed our three-year road map and what we're working on. And we look at it in a few places. But the primary -- I would say, the primary theme is reducing friction. So what we're doing with technology is reducing friction in the guest experience, in the team member experience and in the manager experience in what we do. And so that would mean continue to enhance our off-premise capabilities to make it easier for guests to order repeat orders and to pick up their off-premise experience. In the restaurant, we're looking at a revamp of our point-of-sale system. It's a pretty old system that we developed years ago. We're going to revamp that to make it much easier for our team members to handle the guest experience and to handle off-premise. And for the managers, we're simplifying the way things look in the back of the house. So a lot of our systems, while they have great back-end -- very great back-end, the user interface isn't as great. So, we're working on improving the user interface. But all of those are under the theme of reducing friction.\nJames Rutherford: Okay. Excellent. And then Raj, just one follow-up. I think last quarter you said you were sitting at 115,000 hourly employees across the Company. Could you update us on where you stand today? And where you view full employment given the demand environment here today?\nRaj Vennam: I don't know that we're comfortable sharing the total number of employees at this point, but I'd just say we have made significant progress. In fact, going back, I don't know that we -- I don't remember if we said 115, I think it was a little bit more than that. But anyway, at this point, I'm not so sure we want to get into the exact number of employees other than just let you know we feel pretty good with the way we're staffed, and we don't see any gap.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thanks. Raj, you guys impressively raised your dividend 25% to $1.10. And if we think about the historical 50% to 60% targeted payout ratio, this would imply EPS of $7.33 to $8.80 versus the formal guidance of $7 to $7.50. Can you help rectify that a little bit? Is it just conservatism reflected in the formal guidance?\nRaj Vennam: Okay. Great question. Let me start with, when you think about how we look at our dividend, the 50% to 60% is our target range, right? But at this point, given where we are with our cash on the balance sheet, we felt pretty good about going to the higher end of that range. So as you pointed out, if you look at 60%, then we're right. It's closer to the middle of our guidance. So if you take the middle of our guidance, we're basically at 61% payout. So that's not that -- I would argue that's not that different from the 50% to 60%, especially given we're sitting at a $1.2 billion cash flow, and we expect to still generate significant free cash flow. And at the end of the day, when we look at our business model, this bill only -- the proposed dividend or the dividend that we actually announced this morning, only it's up about 50% of our free cash flow. So we feel really good about where we are. And also, just remember, the target is over time. We had a year where we're below the target. So think of this as a way to kind of make up for a little bit of that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett.\nJeff Farmer: Thank you. On the March earnings call, you reported that hourly labor productivity had improved by, I think, you said over 20% for the system. So I'm just curious, two things. How are you measuring labor productivity? And I think you touched on it a little bit earlier, but how have you driven this level of improvement in productivity?\nRick Cardenas: Jeff, this is Rick. Yes, we did mention that productivity was about 20% better across the system. And we measured on an hour per guest basis. So how many guests can we serve per hour -- per labor hour? And we're still seeing significant labor productivity improvements. As Raj mentioned, we had a significant improvement in labor per labor margin, even with inflation. And the way we did it was what we've been talking about for the last year is continue to improve our processes from the food coming into the backdoor to getting to the table, which means significant menu design work, significant prep design work, which took a lot of the steps and procedures out of the kitchen. And what I would say is we are never done with that. We redesigned our processes over the last year. We have to look at them again, and we have to redesign. So we're going to continue to do that to drive efficiencies where redesign. So we're going to drive efficiencies so that we can reinvest those savings in our plate and give a better experience for our guests.\nJeff Farmer: And then just as a quick follow-up, and I might have missed this earlier, I apologize. But of the 25 states or so that have ended the supplemental unemployment benefits early, what has the hiring or staffing dynamic looked like since that's happened in those states?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Jeff, a lot of those states announced something either late May or early June that would take effect sometime in June. And I think the first date took effect maybe last week. And anecdotally, we have seen a little bit of an improvement in the trend of applicant flow, but we've seen it all across the country, not just states that have eliminated the UI, but even states that haven't yet. It could be because the states that haven't yet are actually starting to open and so you're going to see applicant flow. But we feel really good about our applicant flow into our restaurants. We're hiring -- we're not hiring a lot of people every week, we had a record hiring quarter in the fourth quarter, and we feel really good about where we are.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners.\nBrett Levy: Great. Thanks for taking the call and good morning. I guess just two separate questions. You're obviously talking about some significant EBITDA margin expansion. How should we be thinking about that from a split between the recovery of G&A spending as well as the unit level profitability? And does the progress you've seen of late change what you think the longer-term ceilings are for your restaurant level margin? And then the second question is on the development side, we've obviously seen a lot of news out there of delays of inflation of labor availability. Are you -- what are you seeing on those fronts? And how confident are you about either the cadence of the 35 to 40 or the ability to reach the higher end? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Brad, let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Rick for the development question. So as you look at our margins, I would argue the margin that you saw in Q4, where bulk of it came from the restaurant level, there's a little bit at the G&A. I say a little bit. It's actually 30, 40 basis points, which is huge. So I think as you look forward, I think the way to think about G&A is probably going to be in that somewhere around 40 basis points of favorability, but then the rest is going to come from the restaurant level margins. And the way I would kind of categorize that is the restaurant labor and marketing are going to see an improvement. However, we're going to continue some increase in food cost because of the investments. That's a deliberate choice we made. And then -- so that's how I'd kind of categorize that. And then the restaurant expenses, why should be a little bit better, but not as significant because that's one -- especially because we're not pricing in line with overall inflation. You got to have an impact on all the line items across the P&L.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Brett, on the development side, this is Rick. On the development side, we have a couple of things. One is we shut down our pipeline at the beginning of COVID, and we restarted the pipeline during this fiscal year as we saw us coming out of that. We feel really good about the 14 restaurants we opened. But I would say, you hear a lot about shortages in construction and about product shortages in construction, we're getting out in front of that. So we're ordering product a lot further in advance than we used to. So to make sure that we've got a stainless steel in the kitchen to do the things that we need to do. The good news is you're seeing some of these input costs come down. So hopefully, by the time we're starting to build our restaurants, those input costs are more back to a more reasonable level. I said, the margin improvements we've made in our restaurants and our restaurant profitability has really helped even if the inflation was where people are hearing about it. In terms of cadence of openings, as I said, we got in front of this and started ordering product earlier for our restaurant. But we typically open mid-teen restaurants in the fourth quarter. And of our 30 to 40 restaurants we're going to open this year, we'll probably have mid-teens in the fourth quarter, and the other ones will be kind of spread throughout this fiscal year.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Okay, great. So, on the To Go, you talked about To Go being stickier than perhaps you originally thought. Are you seeing any discernible differences across markets that have recaptured more on-premise sales? And then is there anything that you can share on how consumers are using the To Go occasion? And whether that's a replacement for on-premise versus in that whole meal?\nGene Lee: Well, I think the -- for off-premise, they're using it as a home meal replacement or maybe in the workplace during the day, I think there's no behavioral change there at all. And there's really no difference in what's happening throughout the country as more restaurants, more dinners open. It's been the kind of the same kind of shift. You took down a couple of hundred basis points and you pick more of that up in the dining room. Again, I think that, as I said earlier, I just think this -- I think I'll give the analyst community credit on this. This was stickier than what we thought. We know we've reached some new consumers here. And the experience is very, very good. And so, I think that we don't know where it's coming net out. It's going to net out a lot higher than it was pre-COVID. And I think it's something that's part of our business, we have to pay a lot more attention to as we move forward.\nLauren Silberman: Great. And just if I could do a follow-up on June running at 2.5%. Are there any seasonality considerations in June relative to May? Or are you largely seeing similar average weekly sales?\nRaj Vennam: I'd say, yes, the similar average weekly sales once you take out the north of the holidays.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel.\nChris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Raj, I believe you stated that demand came back at a faster pace than cost. I was hoping you could elaborate on what those costs were given staffing hasn't been an issue and maybe the impact of that timing dynamic?\nRaj Vennam: Well, I would say a little bit of it was staffing. We had to catch up on staffing through the quarter as they accelerated faster than we hired. But by the end of the quarter, we're in a good place. So there was a little bit of that. But beyond that, I think as you look at our P&L, you can see, obviously, the marketing didn't grow as we had sales come in. We didn't have the level of travel was a lot less. Some of these costs that we have, the other cost is really more around growth cost that we said we're going to want to bring back, especially because we want to kind of have the right pipeline of talent for new openings. And those costs are -- we were holding off on some of these to wait for the sales to get back to the levels where we thought we were delivering the right level of returns. And so -- now that the sales are at the levels that are above the pre-COVID, some of these costs will have -- we want to put that back into the P&L. And that's part of the guidance that we provided this morning.\nChris O'Cull: Can you quantify the impact to the store level labor that -- from that timing mismatch during the quarter?\nRaj Vennam: I'd say it's in the 10, 20 basis points. It's not huge.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo.\nJon Tower: Rick, I just wanted to circle back on a comment you made about unit growth in fiscal '23, potentially being above -- or sorry, towards the higher end of that 2% to 3% range that you've historically guided to. I'm just curious, how sustainable do you feel that level of growth is into the future beyond just fiscal '23 in terms of that potentially being a catch-up year of growth from this kind of more disruptive period? And then perhaps you can dig into the components of that growth. Obviously, Olive Garden has been a bigger piece of the gross new store -- excuse me, a bigger piece of growth historically, But going forward, how should we think of that relative to the other brands in the portfolio?\nGene Lee: Jon, thanks. First of all, on the sustainability of the growth going forward, the only thing that can slow us down in growth after this kind of ramp-up is having enough people to open our restaurants, right, having enough general managers ready and able to open our restaurants. We believe that we can stay in the higher end of our range for a little while. Now the economic environment could be different in a year or two that might change that. But we feel really confident that we can get closer to the higher end of our range because of the business model improvements we have made, and it gives the ability to open even more Olive Gardens, right? So when we were opening in Olive Garden before, we would impact many Olive Gardens around them. But with the business model enhancements to Olive Garden has made, we feel even more confident being able to open some of those. Raj had already mentioned Cheddar's and how much they've improved their business model. That has given us more confidence in being able to open more Cheddar's. So that gives us the ability to get towards the higher end of that range. But every one of our brands has the ability to grow, and that's the important thing. We've made significant improvements in the business model at Bahama Breeze, while someone asked about the other segment. I want to tell you that Season 52 has also made a huge business model improvement, even though their sales growth wasn't as strong as Bahama Breeze because of their clientele. That's all coming back. We've opened some pretty darn good Seasons 52 recently, and we opened a great Bahama Breeze recently. So we feel really good about our open all of our brands and be at the higher end of our range for the foreseeable future, unless the environment changes.\nJon Tower: Got it. And then just following up to the comments on To Go business, I think you had mentioned that 64% of To Go orders were online. And I'm just curious to get your thoughts on how you're communicating with those customers today? I mean this is essentially opening up a new channel of marketing that you've already put in place? Or is that something that you're not necessarily even doing today but down the line could harvest as a new marketing channel?\nGene Lee: John, because they're ordering online, we do get a little bit more information about them than we would on a phone order or other orders. And that gives us the ability to market them in the future. We haven't really done a whole lot of marketing in the last year, right? Olive Garden has done TV, because we've bought that media already. We've done some digital marketing just to keep the digital marketing just to keep the digital marketing moving, but we haven't really started focusing on those new customers and demand speaking directly to them. As we start thinking that we need to ramp things up, that's a great source of people to market to now that weren't coming to us before.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks. Gene, I appreciate the commentary on the industry and the industry size, and then shrinking supply. Just wondering if there's anything more that you can share on whether you've been able to identify gains for your brands from the restaurants that have permanently closed? Or if you have any updated thoughts going forward on how you're thinking about your opportunity to gain share from that percentage of supply that's going away?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think, Dennis, I think our opportunity to gain share is gets back to our ability to execute at a really high level. And the fact that we have continued to invest in portion size and quality, and I think that's the key. I think this is all about running great restaurants and executing at a high level. And I think we have a huge opportunity to gain share in all of our restaurants, through comp store sales growth and through organic growth. That's why we're excited about the ability -- our ability to add a lot of new restaurants.\nDennis Geiger: That's great. And then just kind of building on that. Just one more, if I could, on Olive Garden, kind of just following up on the solid recovery that following up on the solid recovery that the brand has seen already. If you could talk just a bit more about the drivers of the continued AUV growth over, let's say, the near to medium term. So I just want to make sure that I understand correctly that it's probably really a function of further capacity increases from the brand from here. But if it's kind of specific drivers, if it's the marketing that you were just talking about turning that on, if it's potential promotional activities that you have in your back pocket, if it's digital, it's probably all of that and more. But Gene, just curious if you could kind of speak to some of those drivers perhaps?\nGene Lee: I believe there's one significant driver, and that's how we have to improve the cravability of the food. And we continue to do that by investing in portions and quality. The team is laser-focused on this. And I think that's the best driver of overall profitable sales growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on Dennis' question, Gene, around the industry. I know you said there's been about 10% fewer units coming out of the industry, yet we're seeing a labor shortage. And just curious if you're seeing any sort of benefits on rent or availability of real estate or anything more specific around development that may be a benefit to Darden?\nGene Lee: No. There's tremendous speculation in the real estate market driving prices up.\nPeter Saleh: Okay. And then just lastly, on menu innovation, how are you guys thinking about menu innovation and expanding the menu? Is the labor squeeze right now? And I know you guys said it's not really as much impacting you guys, but is that keeping a little bit on menu innovation? Are you guys still focusing on some of the core? Any thoughts there?\nGene Lee: We're focused on the core. All innovation right now is trying to improve the products the majority of our consumers buy. We love that focus. We think we're improving cravability. We're improving -- we're continuing to keep our restaurants simplifying and we're sticking to one on, one-off. The teams have great discipline around that right now. And I think that, that's key to our ability to execute at a high level. And as Rick talked about, the improvement in productivity and it's resulting in these record margins.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler.\nNicole Miller: I wanted to ask about the specialty restaurant group of content, specifically around the higher end. I was wondering if you could just kind of give an indication of which brands are above 2019 and which ones are slightly below maybe? And really getting at the ones that are above, what is the likelihood of that structurally being the new run rate? Or is there some reason that demand could pull back? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Well, I don't think there's any reason why demand would pull back. I mean demand might shift from suburban to urban a little bit as business travel starts to reignite. I've been thrilled with the recovery in the last six to seven weeks in Fine Dining. I was surprised how resilient the business was in suburbia through the pandemic. We still got seven or eight really large restaurants in what I would call the heavy urban core that are starting to come back slowly. But overall, I think this business is doing really, really well. And the one business that has started to come back in the last couple of weeks was Seasons 52, which was hit pretty hard when you think about who their consumer was. And so upscale Fine Dining is performing well above where we thought it would be and it's coming back very quickly as we get our three major restaurants in New York City back up and running and downtown Boston and downtown D.C. Those five restaurants are core to what we do, and they're starting to come back quickly.\nNicole Miller: And anything you would change in the -- or excuse me, comment briefly on the customer profile, same guests, different guests eating differently coming at different times, they're just more of the same like it used to be?\nGene Lee: Well, I think, again, we're seeing a little bit -- on the suburban business, we're seeing a little bit more weekend business than what we did. We've seen a little bit of shift without the business travel and what midweek looks like. But overall, that's dynamic, and I go back to my overused word of equilibrium, not transitory. Equilibrium, we'll wait for equilibrium in that business. And we're going to get there the next six months, so we'll understand what the new norms are. But I think we've exposed a lot of people to our Fine Dining brands through this. And I think that they really love the experience.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO.\nAndrew Strelzik: First, I wanted to just clarify quickly on the margin commentary, the 200 to 250 basis point improvement. Is that from an AV perspective relative to pre-COVID levels? Is that at fiscal '22 levels just some context around that? And then my other question is just on the off-premise business. I think there's some uncertainty about how to think about the growth of that channel after kind of the step function we've seen over the last 12-plus months. So kind of what's the growth rate that you would expect from To Go kind of over the next 18 to 24 months or maybe longer term whoever you want to think about that and the drivers behind it?\nGene Lee: I'll take the off-premise question and then Rob can take the margin question. I think on off-premise, until we understand where equilibrium is and where do we get to balance, where is the new level, then we can think about growth. We do think we have more avenues to grow that business. We've learned a lot about that business through the pandemic that we can use to, I think, grow it into the future. Consumer desire for convenience is not going away, and I think we can fulfill that need with our brands and our technology.\nRaj Vennam: And Andrew, on the margin question, we are referencing pre-COVID. So I think the way to think about it is our EBITDA margin at the pre-COVID was around 14%. I think it was actually 14.1%. So the $200 million to $250 million is relative to that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. Obviously, you have -- you doubled your off-premise sales per unit at Olive Garden, basically fourth quarter '21 versus fourth quarter of '19. So that does leave a pretty substantial amount of capacity that kind of remains for on-premise dining. So I wanted to ask a few points on that. You mentioned that much of off-premise is being used as a home meal replacement that would suggest, I guess, the lack of cannibalization for on-premise dining. But can you possibly update those if you know the cannibalization numbers between the percentage of off-premise sales that are coming from on-premise? And I guess, at this point, I mean, do you think it's an opportunity -- a necessity to basically bring back those on-premise customers here was Olive Garden is so busy before that maybe people aren't getting to eat at the times that they want? But just to think about getting that off-premise sales -- on-premise sales per unit back to the 100% level that you previously had in 2019? And if there's anything that you can talk about, whether it's age or that level of vaccination, state by state, what have you, that shows different levels of success of achieving on-premise sales '21 versus '19?\nGene Lee: Yes, John, that was -- there's a lot in there. All I would say, and I want to be brief here is we're going to do whatever we can to drive as much on-premise dining inside Olive Garden as we possibly can profitable sales in the dining room. And we're going to try to grow as profitably as we can in the off-premise channel. We also have to recognize at this point in time, there's still a lot of people out there in our trade that aren't comfortable going into restaurants yet. And so we still have a ways to go to understand where that natural sales level for Olive Garden is going to level out and a lot to learn. And so we haven't been that granular yet to understand who the consumer is. We'll get there once we reach this new place. But our goal is to drive business as we possibly can -- profitable business as we can in restaurant and do as much profitably as we possibly can off-premise.\nJohn Ivankoe: And do you have a sense of the amount of sales transfer between on-premise and off-premise? Or is that data that still needs to come?\nGene Lee: This data needs to come. I mean the environment is so dynamic, and we will need to analyze that. We've got the analytics to be able to really look at that once we've got to this equilibrium that I'm talking about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: I'm actually going to follow up on that. If we assume the 15% sales mix at Olive Garden pre-COVID was off-premise, you're looking at something like down high teens on-premise on a two-year basis. If that right, what constraints do you think we're on the on-premise business in May? And is it really this consumer comfort that that's driving that decline? And how are you thinking about those factors as we go through 2022? I'd be curious to hear whether you think there are any constraints that you would imagine to the on-premise business getting back to, you say, flat or even higher than 2019?\nGene Lee: Well, I mean, I think you have to think about what our promotional and marketing strategy was. Right now, we're just -- we're out there on television just doing some brand advertising. We've been able to remove all incentives and all discounts from the business, and we'll continue to analyze when might be the right opportunity to put some of that back in. I mean this is a complicated question. Olive Garden has never ever operated at these margin levels at this sales volume. And so we need to move slowly. And I don't think that we're looking at what capacity was in '19 and trying to triangulate this the way you guys are talking about it. We're trying to drive as much profitable sales as we possibly can. And so -- and we're just extremely pleased with where this business is. And we're not going to run the business and try to chase an index and get back to some level that -- and deal with and look at our business -- we're looking at our business differently than maybe others are looking at it. And I just couldn't be happier where we've repositioned the Olive Garden business and the record profitability that this business is throwing off.\nDavid Palmer: I'm thinking back to some of our earlier conversations on these earnings calls, and I know you were thinking that you might actually have this on-premise swell where you would overshoot on the on-premise. It's -- I wonder if we might be a couple of quarters away from that if the comfort levels continue to build? If that happens, do you think the capacity in terms of labor, the seats, the lack of cannibalization from off-premise, I mean, do you think that that could happen? Do you still see that potential?\nGene Lee: I think that this -- let me put one thing. This is not -- this is being held back by labor. I mean our restaurants are fully staffed on the weekends. We're doing our three to four turns in Olive Garden. I think the issue is -- if you told me that we could get back to 100% of sales in Olive Garden and spend $100 million less in advertising, I didn't think we could do that. And I'm thrilled with where we're at based on what we're spending and how we're -- and what our profit is per guest at these levels? And we'll continue to focus on driving profitable sales growth and where that ends up, that ends up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thank you very much. First, just, Gene, back on the industry and your outlook, capacity is being reduced, your margins are high, how do you think about M&A in the portfolio right now? Is this a good time to think about adding brands? Is pricing difficult? Are you just very pleased with the current business and portfolio that you really don't think about M&A in this environment?\nGene Lee: Well, we're always talking with the Board and the senior management about what the possibilities are to add a brand to our portfolio that would benefit from being -- I mean our platform being on our platform, and we would benefit that they would come on to our platform. So, we're always thinking about that. But more so today, we're thrilled with the business model transformations in our business. And we're very happy to invest our capital into our businesses and capture the return that we're getting today on those new businesses.\nJohn Glass: And Raj, if I could just clarify. You said you thought in '23, you could hold most of the gains in margins this year. Historically, Darden has talked about 20 to 40 basis points maybe of margin gain year-on-year just on natural leverage. Is there some reason why '23 and beyond may be different, like maybe marketing may be a risk that you've got to add some of that back? How do we think about beyond the current year in terms of margin expansion?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. I think, John, that's where I think there's still some time until we get to fiscal '23 and beyond. And really, I think we need to better understand the economic and competitive environment. And just we got to get holding on this business model, we had the real -- I will use Gene's term of equilibrium is. And just kind of really want to get to find that. But I think where we are today, given the dry powder we have, whether it's with pricing or other levers we can pull, we do feel confident we'll be able to keep most of the margin gains. And like I said, we'll play out and we'll have more to share next time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.\nJake Bartlett: Gene, I was wondering, it's great to see the recovery with Olive Garden. But as a percentage showing it increased versus '19, it is less than some of the other publicly traded companies that have reported. Can you just maybe give us a couple of the reasons why you think that is? I imagine because you're at high capacity in '19 or you have less marketing? But maybe just help us understand why Olive Garden has recovered, I think, to a less degree than a lot of the others?\nGene Lee: Well, because we're not participating in giving our way of food through third-party channels. We're not discounting not discounting heavily. We're not discounting our cash like others are through selling gift cards. And we're running a business here to drive profitable sales growth. We've got a business that's doing over $5 million for average unit volumes. In the fourth quarter, we put up 25% restaurant level margins. Isn't our job to drive profitable sales growth? And that's what we're focused on. And so there are a lot of reasons why we're not keeping up with where some of the other people are going. There's a lot that's changed in two years and how they're handling their businesses. All of them have virtual brands and all this other stuff that's out there. I mean guys, you got to get off this. I mean this is the best business in casual dining, not even by a little bit anymore, by a lot. And we're doing $5 million in average unit volume, with 25-plus restaurant level margins and growing. And we've got -- our guests are loving the experience. They love the credibility of the food. They love the changes that we made, and we're executing at a very, very high level. I think we're going to continue to grow. But I'm really -- I'm not chasing an index, so we're not chasing where we were in the past. We love our position today.\nJake Bartlett: Great. I appreciate that. And I guess also just a question about the industry and about the cadence of the comps from April to May to June. We've seen people getting vaccinated, capacity restrictions being lifted. Why do you think the cadence is not increasing? Why don't you think May versus -- June versus May versus April is increasing? What are the offsets to some of the benefits, which are capacity restrictions being lifted and people getting vaccinated?\nGene Lee: I'm not sure I understand. We did see sequential improvement throughout these months. These look like pretty strong numbers as I look at them across. We saw Fine Dining go from 12 down to 6 in May, that's without our New York restaurants. We've gone from other businesses, 8 to 4 from 14 in March. I mean we're seeing sequential improvement. And again, I think that as we think about it, this has been a very, very fast recovery. And as people start to live more normal than normal -- get back to some normal behaviors, we think it's implied in our guidance that we're going to get back to a pretty good level here.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs.\nJared Garber: Gene and Rick, you talked a little bit about the technology initiatives and some of the success you're having with the tabletop tablets. And I think, last quarter, you talked also about how this is maybe attracting a younger consumer to some of the brands. I just wanted to know if you had any update there on what you're seeing on consumer side related to some of this technology? And maybe if you think the next kind of several years out, what are some of the consumer-facing technologies do you think you'll see or we'll see enter the restaurant space in the in-dining room part of the business?\nRick Cardenas: Jared, thanks. This is Rick. The investments that we have made, is really recently is more about the off-premise experience, right? And so there are just anybody who's coming to our restaurants off-premise. The people that used to come inside that may not still feel comfortable to come inside or going to off-premise. And we are getting a new consumer. At Cheddar's, we have a new consumer that didn't come to Cheddar's before. I don't want to get into the details on that, which gives us more confidence in their ability. They do have the tabletop tablet. I am not going to say that their consumer is younger or older because of the tabletop tablets. It's because they're learning about Cheddar's. And so we're going to continue to invest, as I said, in removing friction to make it easier for our guests to eat where they want, when they want and how they want, and make it easier for our team members to serve them. And so that's what we're going to continue to do without getting into the detail on the new guests or if technology is driving new guests. I'm not going to say technology is driving new guests.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James.\nBrian Vaccaro: Thanks and good morning. Gene, I just want to quickly circle back on the positive industry view in a post-COVID world. And kind of as specifically, how do you expect consumer behavior to normalize as it relates specifically to cooking at home versus ordering in? And also how you see that consideration that may have expanded for the average consumer to utilize casual dining for an off-premise occasion where that was not in the consideration set pre-COVID? Anything in the Technomic data or other data to sort of size that opportunity to capture share of previously at-home cooking occasions?\nGene Lee: Brian, I'm not sure I can quantify that, but I think you answered -- maybe you answered your question and your question is that the casual dining off-premise experience definitely got more exposure through COVID. And I think people that would have never used that experience probably because they weren't casual dining users, and now determined, that's a really good option for home meal replacement. So I think that's an area where you're going to be able to hold on to this new consumer and maybe continue to market to them effectively. We don't have a whole lot of insight on cooking at home and home meal replacement. I do think that you're seeing mobility increase significantly, especially in the states that were heavily locked down. I mean I spent a lot of time in the Northeast, the last couple of weeks. It's still very quiet compared to what I see in Georgia and Florida when I travel. So still has some opportunity to increase in these marketplaces. I don't know where -- I think we've still got another six to nine months to understand what -- if we don't have any more problems with COVID, what are going to be the normal behaviors that are going to develop out of this? And what's -- what was an adaptive behavior? And what was normal? And we'll get through over the next 9 -- 6 to 12 months, and we'll have a better understanding of consumer behaviors. And then I think you start developing your marketing plans and you get tactical on how to get to these folks and try to get them into your restaurants or use you as an off-premise dining occasion.\nBrian Vaccaro: That makes total sense. And a quick follow-up on the guidance. And Raj, sorry if I missed it. But what does the guidance embed in terms of G&A and marketing spend in fiscal '22? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: We did not necessarily share that detail, but I'll just tell you, like I think the G&A is -- you could expect to get leverage on G&A, and we expect marketing to be significantly reduced from pre-COVID. Without getting into the exact numbers, that's what I tell you.\nOperator: And I'll now turn the conference back over of consumer behaviors and any final remarks.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you, we plan to release first quarter results on Thursday, September 23, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gene Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, we had a very strong quarter that exceeded our expectations as sales quickly accelerated from the third quarter. During our call a year ago, I talked about the resiliency of the full-service dining segment and the confidence we had in the industry's ability to bounce back from the impacts of the pandemic, and we've begun to see demand come back at strong levels. As we think about the industry, our consumer insights team has done a lot of good work to better understand the size of the full-service dining segment. There are multiple sources of data that offers sales estimates for the restaurant industry, and the size of the industry and the full-service industry, specifically varies considerably across these sources. This year, we are adopting Technomic as our data source, which we believe better reflects the sales contribution from independent operators, provides a broader view of the restaurant industry, and aligns more closely with the census data. Going forward, we will be referencing industry data provided by Technomic, which sizes the casual dining and fine dining categories for fiscal 2020 at $189 billion and for fiscal 2019 at $222 billion. Given the strong demand we're seeing in the financial health of the consumer, we believe the categories will return to that size or greater despite having approximately 10% fewer units than before the onset of the pandemic. Over the last 15 months, we have made numerous strategic investments. At the restaurant level, we've invested in food quality and portion size that will help strengthen long-term value perceptions for each brand. We also made considerable investments in our team members to ensure our employment proposition remains a competitive advantage. And we invested in technology, particularly within our To Go capabilities, to meet our guests' growing need for convenience and desire for the off-premise experience. Our business model has evolved and is much stronger today. As we begin our new fiscal year, we will remain disciplined in our approach to growing sales, more specifically, our focus is on driving profitable sales growth. Given the business transformation work we have done and the demand we are seeing from the consumer, we are well positioned to thrive in this operating environment. Before I turn it over to Rick, I want to say thank you to our team members in our restaurants and our support center. This was, without a doubt, the most challenging year in our company's history, but thanks to your dedication and perseverance, we have emerged stronger. On behalf of the Board of Directors and the senior leadership team, thank you for all you do to take care of our guests and each other. Rick? Well, let's start with -- on the labor front. I mean, we've made significant investments over time in our people starting way back when we had the tax reform. We made the choice to invest in our people at that point in time. We've invested in our people throughout the pandemic. Our best people have stayed with us through this. We have an attractive employment proposition. We're able to attract people to our businesses to work for us. We think that we're fairly well staffed right now, and as the environment continues to improve, we see no reason why we're not the employer of choice in our businesses. I've been pretty clear saying, I think the restaurant industry is going to continue to struggle attracting workers, but there's enough great hospitality workers out there to staff all Darden restaurants if we provide the best employment proposition. And not just an employment proposition today, it's about potential growth. Our ability to promote from within, we're promoting 1,000 team members a year into management. We're providing other opportunities through training and going out and opening new restaurants. I think our team members really love the experience. And so, I think that we're in great shape from an employment standpoint. We'll continue to invest. We'll manage -- we'll do a great salary administration to ensure that we're paying competitive wages, and I think that we have the flexibility to manage the wage inflation because of our margin structure. And combined with our pricing philosophy, I think we have some room there if need be to offset that and to be able to increase wages if we need to. As far as food inflation goes, I mean, our team has done a fantastic job. We're fairly long on the things that we need to be long on, and I think using our platform and our scale to our advantage through this has been a big advantage, and we feel like we're very well positioned to manage whatever inflation comes our way in the near term and even in the long term. Yes, David. Good morning. It is very limited capacity restrictions out there. There are still a few states and municipalities that have some restrictions on us, but we've got California back last week and we got New York back. So, there's no major market that has restrictions. I think that when we think about where we're at from a sales perspective, we think there's still more room inside the restaurants as we continue to work on -- we think the work we do with our menus and our business model are going to help us with throughput, which is going to enable us to, in these high-volume periods, get more volume to the restaurant. I think Rick's commented in his prepared remarks about what the teams were able to do and execute on Mother's Day to have the biggest -- the best Mother's Day we've ever had before. It says a lot about our ability to execute and get more people through our restaurants in a limited time period. So I don't think we have any capacity restrictions. Obviously, we're seeing less sales growth on the weekends than when we are mid-week just because there's less opportunity in a lot of our high-volume restaurants to get through extra volume. So I mean there's still -- the word I use a lot is we're still in search equilibrium, and we're not there yet. And I don't know when we're going to be there when we see consumers really get into what I would call a normative behavior pattern, and we kind of get to where we understand what the in-restaurant dining is going to be, what the off-premise is going to be. Rick in his comments talk about that we're pleased with where the off-premise is leveling out, even though it's declining slightly. And I said this a while ago, and I think you guys -- a lot of you guys disagree with me. I think you were right and I was wrong that some of this off-premise was stickier than what we thought. And I think a lot has to do with the capabilities we created through the pandemic to make it a lot less frictionless. But we're searching for equilibrium, understanding when and where the business is going to come from. I think we're still in the early innings of that. I think we still got a lot more upside. Well, first thing I would say is Olive Garden is not lagging. I mean I'm just thrilled with their performance. When you're looking at 25.5 restaurant level margins and getting back to pre-COVID sales levels, that's just amazing. That performance is unbelievable. When you look at what's going on in LongHorn, we've been investing in that business for five years since Todd's come back. And he and his team have just done a great job of improving the value perception. When we look at where they are in Technomic and the ratings, they are number one in most categories. They moved from middle of the pack to number one. And so I think LongHorn's performance is just a culmination of a lot of work over a great period of time. And I also -- I want to also recognize that the whole Steakhouse segment is moving. The whole Steakhouse segment has outperformed the other segments, and I believe that's has outperformed the other segments, and I believe that's perceptions. So they're definitely getting a segment lift, but they've also done a great job and they're executing at an extremely high level. I think the greatest risk still is COVID. I mean I think we're getting to the point where we think we're getting to the other side of that. But when I look at what we've put out there for guidance and I think that -- I think we -- obviously, we think we can achieve that. But I look at the greatest risk as being external, not internal, and I don't see risk from a sales perspective or a cost perspective. I think we've got the flexibility, and we've set this up to have the flexibility to deal with almost anything that is thrown at us, with the exception of another outbreak in COVID, where we had to have some restrictions on our business. To me, that's the greatest risk to what we look for. Yes, Chris, on Cheddar's, I would just say that we're extremely pleased with this business at this point. As Raj indicated, the biggest improvement in the business model in all of our business came in Cheddar's. We continue to focus on strengthening the restaurant leadership teams to be able to handle the future growth. But overall, we're very pleased with where this business is at today and very excited about the potential. Yes, James, thanks for the question. We have completed our three-year road map and what we're working on. And we look at it in a few places. But the primary -- I would say, the primary theme is reducing friction. So what we're doing with technology is reducing friction in the guest experience, in the team member experience and in the manager experience in what we do. And so that would mean continue to enhance our off-premise capabilities to make it easier for guests to order repeat orders and to pick up their off-premise experience. In the restaurant, we're looking at a revamp of our point-of-sale system. It's a pretty old system that we developed years ago. We're going to revamp that to make it much easier for our team members to handle the guest experience and to handle off-premise. And for the managers, we're simplifying the way things look in the back of the house. So a lot of our systems, while they have great back-end -- very great back-end, the user interface isn't as great. So, we're working on improving the user interface. But all of those are under the theme of reducing friction. Well, I think the -- for off-premise, they're using it as a home meal replacement or maybe in the workplace during the day, I think there's no behavioral change there at all. And there's really no difference in what's happening throughout the country as more restaurants, more dinners open. It's been the kind of the same kind of shift. You took down a couple of hundred basis points and you pick more of that up in the dining room. Again, I think that, as I said earlier, I just think this -- I think I'll give the analyst community credit on this. This was stickier than what we thought. We know we've reached some new consumers here. And the experience is very, very good. And so, I think that we don't know where it's coming net out. It's going to net out a lot higher than it was pre-COVID. And I think it's something that's part of our business, we have to pay a lot more attention to as we move forward. Jon, thanks. First of all, on the sustainability of the growth going forward, the only thing that can slow us down in growth after this kind of ramp-up is having enough people to open our restaurants, right, having enough general managers ready and able to open our restaurants. We believe that we can stay in the higher end of our range for a little while. Now the economic environment could be different in a year or two that might change that. But we feel really confident that we can get closer to the higher end of our range because of the business model improvements we have made, and it gives the ability to open even more Olive Gardens, right? So when we were opening in Olive Garden before, we would impact many Olive Gardens around them. But with the business model enhancements to Olive Garden has made, we feel even more confident being able to open some of those. Raj had already mentioned Cheddar's and how much they've improved their business model. That has given us more confidence in being able to open more Cheddar's. So that gives us the ability to get towards the higher end of that range. But every one of our brands has the ability to grow, and that's the important thing. We've made significant improvements in the business model at Bahama Breeze, while someone asked about the other segment. I want to tell you that Season 52 has also made a huge business model improvement, even though their sales growth wasn't as strong as Bahama Breeze because of their clientele. That's all coming back. We've opened some pretty darn good Seasons 52 recently, and we opened a great Bahama Breeze recently. So we feel really good about our open all of our brands and be at the higher end of our range for the foreseeable future, unless the environment changes. John, because they're ordering online, we do get a little bit more information about them than we would on a phone order or other orders. And that gives us the ability to market them in the future. We haven't really done a whole lot of marketing in the last year, right? Olive Garden has done TV, because we've bought that media already. We've done some digital marketing just to keep the digital marketing just to keep the digital marketing moving, but we haven't really started focusing on those new customers and demand speaking directly to them. As we start thinking that we need to ramp things up, that's a great source of people to market to now that weren't coming to us before. Yes. I think, Dennis, I think our opportunity to gain share is gets back to our ability to execute at a really high level. And the fact that we have continued to invest in portion size and quality, and I think that's the key. I think this is all about running great restaurants and executing at a high level. And I think we have a huge opportunity to gain share in all of our restaurants, through comp store sales growth and through organic growth. That's why we're excited about the ability -- our ability to add a lot of new restaurants. I believe there's one significant driver, and that's how we have to improve the cravability of the food. And we continue to do that by investing in portions and quality. The team is laser-focused on this. And I think that's the best driver of overall profitable sales growth. No. There's tremendous speculation in the real estate market driving prices up. We're focused on the core. All innovation right now is trying to improve the products the majority of our consumers buy. We love that focus. We think we're improving cravability. We're improving -- we're continuing to keep our restaurants simplifying and we're sticking to one on, one-off. The teams have great discipline around that right now. And I think that, that's key to our ability to execute at a high level. And as Rick talked about, the improvement in productivity and it's resulting in these record margins. Well, I don't think there's any reason why demand would pull back. I mean demand might shift from suburban to urban a little bit as business travel starts to reignite. I've been thrilled with the recovery in the last six to seven weeks in Fine Dining. I was surprised how resilient the business was in suburbia through the pandemic. We still got seven or eight really large restaurants in what I would call the heavy urban core that are starting to come back slowly. But overall, I think this business is doing really, really well. And the one business that has started to come back in the last couple of weeks was Seasons 52, which was hit pretty hard when you think about who their consumer was. And so upscale Fine Dining is performing well above where we thought it would be and it's coming back very quickly as we get our three major restaurants in New York City back up and running and downtown Boston and downtown D.C. Those five restaurants are core to what we do, and they're starting to come back quickly. Well, I think, again, we're seeing a little bit -- on the suburban business, we're seeing a little bit more weekend business than what we did. We've seen a little bit of shift without the business travel and what midweek looks like. But overall, that's dynamic, and I go back to my overused word of equilibrium, not transitory. Equilibrium, we'll wait for equilibrium in that business. And we're going to get there the next six months, so we'll understand what the new norms are. But I think we've exposed a lot of people to our Fine Dining brands through this. And I think that they really love the experience. I'll take the off-premise question and then Rob can take the margin question. I think on off-premise, until we understand where equilibrium is and where do we get to balance, where is the new level, then we can think about growth. We do think we have more avenues to grow that business. We've learned a lot about that business through the pandemic that we can use to, I think, grow it into the future. Consumer desire for convenience is not going away, and I think we can fulfill that need with our brands and our technology. Yes, John, that was -- there's a lot in there. All I would say, and I want to be brief here is we're going to do whatever we can to drive as much on-premise dining inside Olive Garden as we possibly can profitable sales in the dining room. And we're going to try to grow as profitably as we can in the off-premise channel. We also have to recognize at this point in time, there's still a lot of people out there in our trade that aren't comfortable going into restaurants yet. And so we still have a ways to go to understand where that natural sales level for Olive Garden is going to level out and a lot to learn. And so we haven't been that granular yet to understand who the consumer is. We'll get there once we reach this new place. But our goal is to drive business as we possibly can -- profitable business as we can in restaurant and do as much profitably as we possibly can off-premise. This data needs to come. I mean the environment is so dynamic, and we will need to analyze that. We've got the analytics to be able to really look at that once we've got to this equilibrium that I'm talking about. Well, I mean, I think you have to think about what our promotional and marketing strategy was. Right now, we're just -- we're out there on television just doing some brand advertising. We've been able to remove all incentives and all discounts from the business, and we'll continue to analyze when might be the right opportunity to put some of that back in. I mean this is a complicated question. Olive Garden has never ever operated at these margin levels at this sales volume. And so we need to move slowly. And I don't think that we're looking at what capacity was in '19 and trying to triangulate this the way you guys are talking about it. We're trying to drive as much profitable sales as we possibly can. And so -- and we're just extremely pleased with where this business is. And we're not going to run the business and try to chase an index and get back to some level that -- and deal with and look at our business -- we're looking at our business differently than maybe others are looking at it. And I just couldn't be happier where we've repositioned the Olive Garden business and the record profitability that this business is throwing off. I think that this -- let me put one thing. This is not -- this is being held back by labor. I mean our restaurants are fully staffed on the weekends. We're doing our three to four turns in Olive Garden. I think the issue is -- if you told me that we could get back to 100% of sales in Olive Garden and spend $100 million less in advertising, I didn't think we could do that. And I'm thrilled with where we're at based on what we're spending and how we're -- and what our profit is per guest at these levels? And we'll continue to focus on driving profitable sales growth and where that ends up, that ends up. Well, we're always talking with the Board and the senior management about what the possibilities are to add a brand to our portfolio that would benefit from being -- I mean our platform being on our platform, and we would benefit that they would come on to our platform. So, we're always thinking about that. But more so today, we're thrilled with the business model transformations in our business. And we're very happy to invest our capital into our businesses and capture the return that we're getting today on those new businesses. Well, because we're not participating in giving our way of food through third-party channels. We're not discounting not discounting heavily. We're not discounting our cash like others are through selling gift cards. And we're running a business here to drive profitable sales growth. We've got a business that's doing over $5 million for average unit volumes. In the fourth quarter, we put up 25% restaurant level margins. Isn't our job to drive profitable sales growth? And that's what we're focused on. And so there are a lot of reasons why we're not keeping up with where some of the other people are going. There's a lot that's changed in two years and how they're handling their businesses. All of them have virtual brands and all this other stuff that's out there. I mean guys, you got to get off this. I mean this is the best business in casual dining, not even by a little bit anymore, by a lot. And we're doing $5 million in average unit volume, with 25-plus restaurant level margins and growing. And we've got -- our guests are loving the experience. They love the credibility of the food. They love the changes that we made, and we're executing at a very, very high level. I think we're going to continue to grow. But I'm really -- I'm not chasing an index, so we're not chasing where we were in the past. We love our position today. I'm not sure I understand. We did see sequential improvement throughout these months. These look like pretty strong numbers as I look at them across. We saw Fine Dining go from 12 down to 6 in May, that's without our New York restaurants. We've gone from other businesses, 8 to 4 from 14 in March. I mean we're seeing sequential improvement. And again, I think that as we think about it, this has been a very, very fast recovery. And as people start to live more normal than normal -- get back to some normal behaviors, we think it's implied in our guidance that we're going to get back to a pretty good level here. Brian, I'm not sure I can quantify that, but I think you answered -- maybe you answered your question and your question is that the casual dining off-premise experience definitely got more exposure through COVID. And I think people that would have never used that experience probably because they weren't casual dining users, and now determined, that's a really good option for home meal replacement. So I think that's an area where you're going to be able to hold on to this new consumer and maybe continue to market to them effectively. We don't have a whole lot of insight on cooking at home and home meal replacement. I do think that you're seeing mobility increase significantly, especially in the states that were heavily locked down. I mean I spent a lot of time in the Northeast, the last couple of weeks. It's still very quiet compared to what I see in Georgia and Florida when I travel. So still has some opportunity to increase in these marketplaces. I don't know where -- I think we've still got another six to nine months to understand what -- if we don't have any more problems with COVID, what are going to be the normal behaviors that are going to develop out of this? And what's -- what was an adaptive behavior? And what was normal? And we'll get through over the next 9 -- 6 to 12 months, and we'll have a better understanding of consumer behaviors. And then I think you start developing your marketing plans and you get tactical on how to get to these folks and try to get them into your restaurants or use you as an off-premise dining occasion."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.3 billion, 79.5% higher than last year, driven by 90.4% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 30 net new restaurants, partially offset by one less week of operations this year. The improvements we made to our business model, combined with fourth quarter sales accelerating faster than cost, drove strong profitability, resulting in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.03. Our reported earnings were $0.76 higher due to a nonrecurring tax benefit of $99.7 million. This benefit primarily relates to our estimated federal net operating loss for fiscal year 2021, which will carry back to the preceding five years. Looking at our performance throughout the quarter, we saw same-restaurant sales versus pre-COVID improving from negative 4.1% in March to positive 2.4% in May. And same-restaurant sales for the first three weeks of June were 2.5% compared to two years ago. To Go sales for Olive Garden and LongHorn continue to be significantly higher than pre-COVID levels. We have seen a gradual decline in weekly To Go sales. However, that decline is being more than offset by an increase in dine-in sales. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L. Compared to pre-COVID results, food and beverage expenses were 90 basis points higher, driven by investments in both food quality and pricing below inflation. For reference, food inflation in Q4 was 4.3% versus last year. Restaurant labor was 190 basis points lower, driven by hourly labor improvement of 320 basis points due to efficiencies gained from the operation simplification and was partially offset by continued wage pressures. Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 200 basis points of favorability. G&A expense was 30 basis points lower, driven primarily by savings from the corporate restructuring earlier in the year. As a result, we achieved record restaurant level EBITDA margin for Darden of 22.6%, 310 basis points above pre-COVID levels and record quarterly EBITDA of $412 million. We had $5 million in impairments due to the write-off of multiple restaurant-related assets. And our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12%, excluding the impact of the non-recurring tax benefit I previously mentioned. Looking at our segments. We achieved record segment profit dollars and margins at Olive Garden, LongHorn and the other business segment this quarter. Fine Dining improved segment profit margins versus pre-COVID despite sales decline. These results were driven by reduced labor and marketing expenses as we continue to focus on simplified operations, while also continuing to invest in food quality and pricing below inflation. 2021 was a year like no other. And despite the challenges of constantly shifting capacity restrictions an uncertain guest demand, we delivered $7.2 billion in total sales. The actions we took in response to COVID-19 to solidify our cash position and transform our business model helped build solid foundation for recovery and resulted in over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA and over $920 million of free cash flow results. As a result, we repaid our term loan, reinstated our pre-COVID dividend and quickly built up our cash position. Our disciplined approach to simplifying operations and driving profitable sales growth positions us well for the future. As a result of our strong performance, cash position and the fiscal 2022 outlook, this morning, we also announced our Board approved a 25% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share, implying an annual dividend of $4.40. This results in a yield of 3.2% based on yesterday's closing share price. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022, we assume full operating capacity for essentially all restaurants, and we do not anticipate any significant business interruptions related to COVID-19. Based on these assumptions, we expect total sales of $9.2 billion to $9.5 billion, representing growth of 5% to 8% from pre-COVID levels, same-restaurant sales growth of 25% to 29% and 35 to 40 new restaurants. Capital spending of $375 million to $425 million; total inflation of approximately 3%, with commodities inflation of approximately 2.5% and hourly labor inflation of approximately 6%; EBITDA of $1.5 billion to $1.59 billion; an annual effective tax rate of 13% to 14% and approximately $131 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in a diluted net earnings per share between $7 and $7.50. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Yes, Brian, I think as we look at where our guidance is, let me just start with that. When you think about what we guided this morning for fiscal 2022, that implies EBITDA margin growth of between 200 on the lower end to 250 on the higher end. And so clearly, our sales have recovered. The -- some of the flow-through we're letting it flow to the bottom line. But we have made some investments -- continue to make investments. And as Gene mentioned, we are pricing well below inflation. In fact, I think this morning, we said we expect overall inflation to be around 3%, and our pricing is in the middle of our one to two target. So we are pricing well below inflation. That's the biggest investment we're making, but it also gives us some extra dry powder if there was additional inflation that was to come our way. So, we do think the $200 million to $250 million is a good target for us now, but as we think beyond that, I think we need to better understand the economic and competitive environment as we hone in on the business model. And I would say based on where we are today, we expect to retain most of that margin improvement we'll see in FY '22. Hi, Eric. So yes, as you look at inflation, we said commodities is around 2.5% for the full year. But it is -- the front half of the year is somewhere between 3.5% to 4% and then it is a little bit -- it tapers off a little bit as we go into the back. And as I said in my prepared remarks, Q4 this year was 4.3%, which implies -- which is where we think as we wsrap on next year, we expect Q4 to be more closer to flat. And so that's kind of the cadence. And then about the drivers of commodity inflation, I'd say chicken and seafood are high, and we're also seeing significant inflation in cooking oil, a little bit in dairy, and I'd say the other thing is packaging. Packaging continues to be -- especially with the resin costs going up, packaging is another factor. So all in all, those are the big drivers of inflation on the commodity side. And on the labor side, overall labor, we expect to be somewhere between 4%, 4.5%. But wage rate itself, we expect that to be around 6%. Jeff, this is Raj. So when you think about the cadence, I mean, I think May to June, I mean, it's three weeks, 2.5%. That's -- we feel pretty good about where we are on that in terms of same-restaurant sales. I would argue they are actually a little bit better than what we had expected going into the fiscal year. And then as you look at the cadence of some of as the markets open up as the capacity restrictions are lifted, we are seeing some movement, especially in California and places like that. But when you blend everything at the Darden level, some of these brands that are impacted the most are brands that are not a big portion -- playing a big part of our overall portfolio. So, it takes a lot to move the needle on our blended same-restaurant sales. And then there are other factors you got to take into consideration, especially, as you look at versus fiscal '19, because we're not doing some of the promotional activity. We're not doing things that would have stimulated demand in the past that we're doing now, right? So there is that we are basically comparing to a level that was different when we had a lot more spend in marketing and other stuff. But as Gene said, I think the continuation of the same team that we are thrilled with where we are, and we're also thrilled with our business model. However -- and the fact that we're able to make investments not only our people, but also in our guests through food quality, food portion and pricing. So we're giving a lot back to the guests, while actually getting a strong business model. And so I think that's how I would, I guess, address the question. Yes. So I think as we look at our -- Chris, as we look at the other segment, I'd point out a couple of the brands -- business model transformation was significant. I'll say Cheddar's is a big part of that and Bahama Breeze in another brand where we saw a significant improvement in the business model. And part of this is going back to the simplification. We had a chance to kind of break down everything, rebuild back up and kind of figure out a way to transform the business model. So those two brands are primarily contributing to the significant growth we have in the other segment. And as we look at next fiscal year, they still play a decent role, right? I mean when you look at the other segment, it's about 20% of it. So they're not going to be a huge contributor. But related to their size, they are going to be outperforming on the segment margin. I don't know that we're comfortable sharing the total number of employees at this point, but I'd just say we have made significant progress. In fact, going back, I don't know that we -- I don't remember if we said 115, I think it was a little bit more than that. But anyway, at this point, I'm not so sure we want to get into the exact number of employees other than just let you know we feel pretty good with the way we're staffed, and we don't see any gap. Okay. Great question. Let me start with, when you think about how we look at our dividend, the 50% to 60% is our target range, right? But at this point, given where we are with our cash on the balance sheet, we felt pretty good about going to the higher end of that range. So as you pointed out, if you look at 60%, then we're right. It's closer to the middle of our guidance. So if you take the middle of our guidance, we're basically at 61% payout. So that's not that -- I would argue that's not that different from the 50% to 60%, especially given we're sitting at a $1.2 billion cash flow, and we expect to still generate significant free cash flow. And at the end of the day, when we look at our business model, this bill only -- the proposed dividend or the dividend that we actually announced this morning, only it's up about 50% of our free cash flow. So we feel really good about where we are. And also, just remember, the target is over time. We had a year where we're below the target. So think of this as a way to kind of make up for a little bit of that. Brad, let me start, and then I'll hand it over to Rick for the development question. So as you look at our margins, I would argue the margin that you saw in Q4, where bulk of it came from the restaurant level, there's a little bit at the G&A. I say a little bit. It's actually 30, 40 basis points, which is huge. So I think as you look forward, I think the way to think about G&A is probably going to be in that somewhere around 40 basis points of favorability, but then the rest is going to come from the restaurant level margins. And the way I would kind of categorize that is the restaurant labor and marketing are going to see an improvement. However, we're going to continue some increase in food cost because of the investments. That's a deliberate choice we made. And then -- so that's how I'd kind of categorize that. And then the restaurant expenses, why should be a little bit better, but not as significant because that's one -- especially because we're not pricing in line with overall inflation. You got to have an impact on all the line items across the P&L. I'd say, yes, the similar average weekly sales once you take out the north of the holidays. Well, I would say a little bit of it was staffing. We had to catch up on staffing through the quarter as they accelerated faster than we hired. But by the end of the quarter, we're in a good place. So there was a little bit of that. But beyond that, I think as you look at our P&L, you can see, obviously, the marketing didn't grow as we had sales come in. We didn't have the level of travel was a lot less. Some of these costs that we have, the other cost is really more around growth cost that we said we're going to want to bring back, especially because we want to kind of have the right pipeline of talent for new openings. And those costs are -- we were holding off on some of these to wait for the sales to get back to the levels where we thought we were delivering the right level of returns. And so -- now that the sales are at the levels that are above the pre-COVID, some of these costs will have -- we want to put that back into the P&L. And that's part of the guidance that we provided this morning. I'd say it's in the 10, 20 basis points. It's not huge. And Andrew, on the margin question, we are referencing pre-COVID. So I think the way to think about it is our EBITDA margin at the pre-COVID was around 14%. I think it was actually 14.1%. So the $200 million to $250 million is relative to that. Yes. I think, John, that's where I think there's still some time until we get to fiscal '23 and beyond. And really, I think we need to better understand the economic and competitive environment. And just we got to get holding on this business model, we had the real -- I will use Gene's term of equilibrium is. And just kind of really want to get to find that. But I think where we are today, given the dry powder we have, whether it's with pricing or other levers we can pull, we do feel confident we'll be able to keep most of the margin gains. And like I said, we'll play out and we'll have more to share next time. We did not necessarily share that detail, but I'll just tell you, like I think the G&A is -- you could expect to get leverage on G&A, and we expect marketing to be significantly reduced from pre-COVID. Without getting into the exact numbers, that's what I tell you."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. Our results this quarter are a combination of the business model transformation work that Gene referenced as well as the simplification efforts we implemented throughout the year. Significant process and menu simplification at each brand has enabled us to drive high levels of execution and strengthen margins, further positioning our brands for long-term success. As we began the quarter, our restaurant teams remained disciplined, while continuing to operate in a difficult and unpredictable environment. As restrictions continue to ease and dine-in traffic increased, our teams successfully managed through it, thanks to their focus on being brilliant with the basics, ensuring we provided great food with outstanding service in an enjoyable atmosphere for all of our guests. This enabled us to deliver record-setting results. For example, Olive Garden broke its all-time, single-day sales record on Mother's Day. Additionally, both Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse achieved the highest quarterly segment profit in their history. Even as capacity restrictions eased and we were able to utilize more of our dining rooms, off-premise sales remained strong during the quarter. Off-premise sales accounted for 33% of total sales at Olive Garden, 19% at LongHorn, and 16% at Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Guest demand for off-premise has been stickier than we originally thought, and this is driven by the focus of our restaurant teams and the investments we made to improve our digital platform throughout the year. Technology enhancements to online ordering and the introduction of new capabilities such as To Go capacity management and Curbside I'm Here notification, improves the experience for our guests, while making it easier for our operators to execute. As a result, during the quarter, 64% of Olive Garden's to-go orders were placed online and 14% of Darden's total sales were digital transactions. Thanks to additional technology enhancements, we continue to see guests utilize our digital tools even when they were dining in our restaurants. Nearly half of all guest checks were scheduled digitally either online on our tabletop tablets or via mobile pay. The business model improvements we have made also reinforced our ability to open value-creating new restaurants across all of our brands. During the quarter, we opened 14 new restaurants, and these restaurants are outperforming our expectations. While Raj will discuss specific new restaurant targets for fiscal '22, we are working to develop a pipeline of restaurants and future leaders that would put us at the higher end of our long-term framework of 2% to 3% sales growth from new units as we enter fiscal 2023. Finally, the strength of the Darden platform has helped our brands navigate near-term external challenges. The employment environment has been an issue for the industry. However, the power of our employment proposition strengthened by the investments we have in our people, continue to pay off as we retain our best talent and recruit new team members to more fully staff our restaurants. So, while there are staffing challenges in some areas, we are not experiencing systematic issues. Additionally, the strength of our platform has helped us avoid significant supply chain interruptions. Our supply chain team continues to leverage our scale to ensure our restaurant teams have the key products they need to serve our guests. Notably, the few spot outages we have experienced are related to warehouse staffing and driver shortages, not product availability. To wrap up, I also want to recognize our outstanding team members. During my restaurant visits, I'm inspired by the positive attitude and flexibility you demonstrate every day. Thank you for all you have done and continue to do to deliver great experiences for our guests. Now, I'll turn it over to Raj. Jeff, this is Rick. Yes, we did mention that productivity was about 20% better across the system. And we measured on an hour per guest basis. So how many guests can we serve per hour -- per labor hour? And we're still seeing significant labor productivity improvements. As Raj mentioned, we had a significant improvement in labor per labor margin, even with inflation. And the way we did it was what we've been talking about for the last year is continue to improve our processes from the food coming into the backdoor to getting to the table, which means significant menu design work, significant prep design work, which took a lot of the steps and procedures out of the kitchen. And what I would say is we are never done with that. We redesigned our processes over the last year. We have to look at them again, and we have to redesign. So we're going to continue to do that to drive efficiencies where redesign. So we're going to drive efficiencies so that we can reinvest those savings in our plate and give a better experience for our guests. Yes, Jeff, a lot of those states announced something either late May or early June that would take effect sometime in June. And I think the first date took effect maybe last week. And anecdotally, we have seen a little bit of an improvement in the trend of applicant flow, but we've seen it all across the country, not just states that have eliminated the UI, but even states that haven't yet. It could be because the states that haven't yet are actually starting to open and so you're going to see applicant flow. But we feel really good about our applicant flow into our restaurants. We're hiring -- we're not hiring a lot of people every week, we had a record hiring quarter in the fourth quarter, and we feel really good about where we are. Yes, Brett, on the development side, this is Rick. On the development side, we have a couple of things. One is we shut down our pipeline at the beginning of COVID, and we restarted the pipeline during this fiscal year as we saw us coming out of that. We feel really good about the 14 restaurants we opened. But I would say, you hear a lot about shortages in construction and about product shortages in construction, we're getting out in front of that. So we're ordering product a lot further in advance than we used to. So to make sure that we've got a stainless steel in the kitchen to do the things that we need to do. The good news is you're seeing some of these input costs come down. So hopefully, by the time we're starting to build our restaurants, those input costs are more back to a more reasonable level. I said, the margin improvements we've made in our restaurants and our restaurant profitability has really helped even if the inflation was where people are hearing about it. In terms of cadence of openings, as I said, we got in front of this and started ordering product earlier for our restaurant. But we typically open mid-teen restaurants in the fourth quarter. And of our 30 to 40 restaurants we're going to open this year, we'll probably have mid-teens in the fourth quarter, and the other ones will be kind of spread throughout this fiscal year. Jared, thanks. This is Rick. The investments that we have made, is really recently is more about the off-premise experience, right? And so there are just anybody who's coming to our restaurants off-premise. The people that used to come inside that may not still feel comfortable to come inside or going to off-premise. And we are getting a new consumer. At Cheddar's, we have a new consumer that didn't come to Cheddar's before. I don't want to get into the details on that, which gives us more confidence in their ability. They do have the tabletop tablet. I am not going to say that their consumer is younger or older because of the tabletop tablets. It's because they're learning about Cheddar's. And so we're going to continue to invest, as I said, in removing friction to make it easier for our guests to eat where they want, when they want and how they want, and make it easier for our team members to serve them. And so that's what we're going to continue to do without getting into the detail on the new guests or if technology is driving new guests. I'm not going to say technology is driving new guests."

Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene.\nGene Lee: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. It's hard to believe it\u2019s been a year since the pandemic began to significantly impact our business. When I reflect back on everything that has transpired, it is clear to me the strategy we developed six years ago provided a strong foundation to help us navigate this period of unprecedented change and uncertainty. Our portfolio of iconic brands has been focused on executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy while leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results oriented culture. And while our four competitive advantages were critical to our business and operational success this past year, our significant scale and results oriented culture have played an outsized role in our ability to emerge stronger. Our significant scale enabled us to quickly react to the turbulent operating environment. The depth and breadth of our supply chain relationships ensured that we could adjust our product supply as needed without experiencing any significant interruptions. We have our own dedicated distribution network, and the assurance of an uninterrupted supply chain provided consistency and a high level of certainty for our operators. Our scale also enabled us to significantly accelerate the development of online ordering and several other digital initiatives and cascade them across our brands quickly and effectively. The robust expansion of our digital platform over the past year has provided us a richer set of first-party data on new and existing guest. Finally, our scale provided us with multiple levers to pull to ensure we have the liquidity we needed during the early days of COVID-19. As soon as our liquidity needs were solved for, our brands were able to focus on strengthening their value propositions and transforming their business models. As our Founder, Bill Darden said, the greatest competitive advantage our company has is the quality of our employees evidenced by the excellent job they do every day. Throughout this past year, Darden and our brands have emerged stronger and our success is a direct result of our team members and their relentless commitment to delivering safe and exceptional guest experiences. That is why we've continued to invest in our team members throughout the past year. Since March of 2020, we've invested more than $200 million in our people through programs such as paid sick leave. COVID-19 emergency pay and covering insurance payments and benefit deductions for team members who were furloughed. These investments also include our recent decision to provide all hourly restaurant team members up to four hours of paid time off for the purpose of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, these investments include the one-time bonus we announced today totaling approximately $17 million, which will impact nearly 90,000 hourly team members. As we continue to grow our business and welcome guests back into our restaurants, continuing to attract and retain the best talent in the industry will be critical to our success. While we're proud that on average, our hourly restaurant team members earn more than $17 per hour today, which includes our servers and bartenders who earn more than $20 an hour. I'm excited about the announcement we made this morning. Beginning Monday, every hourly team member tipped and non-tipped will earn at least $10 per hour, inclusive of tip income. Additionally, we are committed to raising that amount to $11 per hour in January 2022 and to $12 per hour in January 2023. These investments further strengthen our industry leading employment proposition. Lastly, I continue to be impressed and inspired by our team members who have shown extraordinary resilience and passion during the past year. Once again, I thank you for your commitment to delivering exceptional guest experiences in our dining room and through curbside to go. You are the heart and soul of our company. And on behalf of the management team, we're extremely grateful to you. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. As Gene said, it's hard to believe we've been operating in this environment for a year. In addition to executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy, our restaurant teams have continued to successfully manage this \u2013 through this situation by remaining focused on the four key priorities we established at the onset of the pandemic: One, ensuring the health and safety of our team members and guests. Two, simplifying operations and strengthening execution. Three, deploying technology to improve the guest experience. And four, transforming our business model. The health and safety of our team members and guests remains our top priority. Throughout the past year, our team members have done a fantastic job of upholding our safety protocols while taking great care of our guests. Today, even as restrictions are easing in some parts of the country, we continue to follow our enhanced safety measures. This includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring masks for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols. Our second priority has been to continue finding ways to simplify our operations and drive in-restaurant execution at each of our brands. This environment gave us a once in a lifetime opportunity to evaluate every aspect of how we operate and make decisions we would not have been able to do in a normal operating environment. A good example of this work, all of our brands have done to streamline menus and remove low preference or low satisfaction items. This focus makes it easier for our restaurant teams to consistently execute our highest preference items, which means we are serving our most popular dishes to more guests. In fact, a year ago, the top 10 entrees at Olive Garden accounted for about 48% of guest preference. And today they account for approximately 55%. Reducing the bottom selling items eliminates distractions and allows us to execute at a high level. We have dramatically reduced low volume items, which reduces the need to prepare them saving time and reducing food waste. For example, at LongHorn Steakhouse, the number of total items with less than 1% preference is down to eight from more than 25, pre-COVID. Third, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience and build on the progress we have made over the last 12 months. When the pandemic began and our dining rooms were closed, we were able to quickly roll out online ordering at our brands that had yet to deploy it. We also streamlined the curbside to go pick up process by rolling out the Curbside I'm Here text message notification feature. So guests can easily alert us when they arrive. These technology enhancements and other process improvements helped Olive Garden achieve new all time high guest satisfaction ratings for delivering on-time and accurate off-premise experiences during a quarter that included three busy off premise days, Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and Valentine's Day. In fact, Valentine's Day was our highest sales day since the start of the pandemic. Also during the quarter, several brands including Olive Garden and LongHorn implemented enhancements to their websites to streamline the online checkout process. This resulted in a meaningful reduction in order abandonment rates. Our continuous digital transformation is resonating with our guests. In fact, during the quarter, nearly 19% of total sales were digital transactions. Further 50% of all guests checks were settled digitally, either online or on our tabletop tablets or via MobilePay. We have made great strides in our digital journey over the past year, and we will continue to strengthen our digital platform and provide our brands with the tools to compete more effectively. And finally, the investments we've made to simplify our business through menu and process simplification have resulted in significant transformation of our business model. For example, across Darden, our hourly labor productivity has improved by over 20% with some brands improving by well over 30% such as Cheddar's. We thought it would be helpful to provide a bit more insight into what the business model transformation has done to Cheddar's P&L, year-to-date through the third quarter Cheddar's has grown the restaurant level margins by over 300 basis points and a year-to-date sales retention of 75%. When Cheddar's reaches 100% of the pre-COVID sales, we expect that restaurant level margins to be well in the high teens, while we don't intend to continue to provide this level of detail in the future this illustration helps to highlight the business model improvements our brands are making. As we have mentioned previously, the simplifications across all of our businesses are expected to result in 150 basis points of margin improvement with 90% of pre-COVID sales. Our business model transformation also strengthens our belief in our ability to open value creating new restaurants across all of our brands. Due to this transformation, the sales required to exceed our return expectations are much lower today. In fact, we opened six new restaurants during the quarter, and each is exceeding our expectations. Before I hand it over to Raj, I want to conclude by saying thank you to our team members. As Gene said, our success is a direct result of their hard work. Being of service is at the heart of our business and our team members demonstrate that every day through their commitment to our guests and each. Raj?\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. For the third quarter, total sales for $1.73 billion, a decrease of 26.1%. Same restaurant sales decreased 26.7%. EBITDA was $236 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.98. Turning to this quarter of P&L; food and beverage expenses were 80 basis points higher than last year primarily driven by investments in food quality and mix. Restaurant labor was 20 basis points higher. As Gene mentioned, we invested approximately $17 million in team member bonuses this quarter. Excluding the team member bonuses, restaurant labor would have been 80 basis points favorable to last year. The favorability to last year was driven by hourly labor improvement of 280 basis points due to efficiencies gained from operational simplifications Rick discussed. The hourly labor improvement was partially offset by de-leveraging management labor due to sales declines. Restaurant expense for operating week was 16% lower than last year driven by lower workers' compensation, utilities, repairs and maintenance expense. Restaurant expenses as a percent of sales was 250 basis points higher than last year due to sales de-leverage. Marketing spend was $52 million lower than last year with total marketing 200 basis points favorable to last year. This all does altered in restaurant level EBITDA margin of 18.4%, only 150 basis points below last year. Excluding the one-time hourly team member bonus, restaurant level EBITDA margin would have been even stronger at 19.4%. We impaired one Yard House restaurant this quarter resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $3 million. This location was in Portland, Oregon and had been temporarily closed since April. Turning to G&A; we finalized the legal recovery during the quarter resulting in favorable of $16 million. This favorability was partially offset by $8.8 million of mark-to-market expense on our different compensation. Excluding these two items, G&A would have been $86 million this quarter. As a reminder, the mark-to-market expense is related to significant appreciation in both the Darden share price and equity market this quarter, and due to the way we hedge this expense it is mostly offset on an after tax basis. Page 13 of this quarter's presentation illustrates the $8.8 million reduction of operating income and corresponding operating income margin reduction of 50 basis points from mark-to-market expense. Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $7.2 million resulting in a net reduction to earnings after tax this quarter of $1.6 million. Our effective tax rate of 2.3% this quarter was unusually low due to two factors: first, the tax benefit from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned reduces the tax rate by 5 percentage points. Second, the stock option exercises this quarter drove approximately $7 million of excess tax benefit. Reducing the tax rate by 4.8 percentage points, after adjusting for these factors our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter would have been 12.1%. Looking at our segment performance this quarter, Olive Garden saw segment profit margin increase versus last year despite sales declines. Our continued focus on simplified operations, which significantly reduced direct labor combined with lower marketing expenses, drove this margin improvement. Segment profit margin declined for Longhorn as higher than average beef inflation and other investments drove higher food and beverage expense. In addition, both labor and restaurant expenses were higher as a percent of sales due to sales de-leverage. Segment profit margin declined for fine dining and other segments due to de-leverage across the P&L from the significant sales decline year-over-year. We generated over $240 million of free cash flow this quarter ending the third quarter with our $990 million in cash. Our recent performance has given us better visibility into the durability of our cash flows. Therefore, we will return to our 50% to 60% dividend payout target applied to future earnings to determine our dividend. To that end, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share matching our pre-COVID dividend level. The ability to resume pre-COVID dividend levels just 12 months after suspending is a testament to the strength of our business model and the durability of our cash flows. And finally, today we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $500 million, which replaces all previous authorizations Turning to the fourth quarter; as of today, we have 99% of our dining rooms open with some capacity. This morning, we provided sales plans for the first three weeks of the quarter, in which we saw a week-to-week sales improvements. As the vaccine roller progressed, dining room capacity increased, and consumers began receiving stimulus checks. Taking that all into consideration we currently expect for the fourth quarter total sales of approximately $2.1 billion; EBITDA between $345 million and $360 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $1.60 and $1.70 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares. We've also updated our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be between $285 million and $295 million, and we anticipate opening 33 net new restaurants for the year. We continue to believe we can achieve pre-COVID EBITDA dollars on 90% of pre-COVID sales resulting in 150 basis points of EBITDA margin growth, and our Q4 outlook falls within this framework. As we move beyond the fourth quarter, there are additional costs such as training, travel, growth costs, incremental marketing and other investment that we expect will need to come back into the P&L. And while it's too early to provide insights into fiscal 2022 sales and earnings, we did want to provide some preliminary guidance on a few items. We expect total capital spending between $350 million and $400 million and open approximately 35 new desiccant sent in fiscal 2022. We also anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of 12% to 13% for fiscal 2022. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Just a clarification first, the \u2013 that [indiscernible] thinking about 150 basis points of margin expansion permanently, did that contemplate these labor investments that you're making? That clarification would be helpful. But my question is really about the seating currently, and you're thinking about the meaningfulness of recent weeks. The seating capacity you mentioned you have partial dining rooms in 99% of the restaurants or locations, but how much of the seating is available currently? And how much do you think that that is holding back comps? And Gene, my follow-up, which I'll just say right now, it looks like these off-premise numbers are very strong. The mix is very high, even as people get more comfortable, are you rethinking the stickiness of that off-premise business and I'll pass it on? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Good morning, David. Yes, the labor investments we made is embedded in the 150 basis points improvement. We think we can make at 90% of sales; so that is inclusive there. We'll talk about the dining capacity. Basically, the way our dinings are laid out, LongHorn has an advantage over Olive Garden and its utilization because of the number of boosts. But the way to think about it is, we're somewhere between 50% and 60% capacity inside the dining room depending on the particular four plan, and so there's still limitations of availability inside our restaurants. As long as we're following the CDC guidelines, it doesn't matter what the local municipalities are doing. And we believe right now, it's in our best interest, our team members' best interest with the priority of their health and safety for our team members and our guests to continue to follow the CDC guidelines. And so we think about our dining room somewhere between 50% and 60%, 65% depending on the individual floor plan off premise stickiness. Let me just \u2013 let me start off by saying, I am incredibly impressed with what our team has done to improve our capabilities in the off-premise experience. The digital experience is getting better every single day, it's being adopted, I thought in Rick's prepared remarks, he talked about 19% of our total sales now being digital. I think that's really impressive. I do believe that as more as we get to offer more capacity and we see this in individual restaurants that the off premise will start to fall off. I think why the capacity is limited, and there's still a lot of people out there that aren't fully vaccinated. There's still good demand for the off premise. I believe that because of our capabilities that we've developed during the pandemic and our vision for how those capabilities will continue to improve in the future, that our off-premise business will still be robust when it's all said and done. I can't tell you today what that percentage is going to be.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks for the question. Gene wanted to ask a bit more about any kind of regional differences that you might be seeing. I think you gave some interesting color there on CDC guidelines being the capacity constraint in most cases for your restaurants. But curious by region, by state, if you're seeing a notable difference in performance based on those state restrictions, and then just kind of following-up on that as it relates to off premise where you do have greater capacity in select restaurants or states, if that off premise looks a whole lot different than it does across the system on average? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Well, obviously we're only at 25% capacity in California, which is \u2013 that's pretty restrictive there. So, yes, our takeout percentage is higher in California. So I would say it's still pressure on the coast, both coasts, especially the North \u2013 Northeast part of the country. You're still seeing mobility, not as great as it is and what I would call from Arizona all the way over to Carolinas where I think mobility is much greater and the consumer is much more willing to get out and move around. So there's difference in sales there. But every day, I mean, this is very dynamic folks. This is changing daily as more and more people get vaccinated, more and more people get become confident in their ability to be mobile. And it's getting to the point where, I think we're cautiously optimistic and excited about what's going to transpire here over the next few months and maybe few years.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open\nJeff Farmer: Sorry, just looking for a little bit of a follow-up call here. So just in terms of looking at to go sales, I'm curious what you've learned in terms of the nature of these customers? Are they new customers that are \u2013 are there new customers? Are they existing customers driving increased frequency? I'm just curious what you guys are seeing in terms of, who's actually driving these very strong to go sales levels?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Jeff, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. In regards to those sales and who's driving it, you know, at the start of the pandemic we saw a lot of new customers. A lot of new ones coming in and then hadn't been to our restaurants before and the frequency with which they reordered was pretty high. We're still seeing those new customers but everybody is ordering to go, right? If you came into the dining room and the dining room is full, you may just walk over to the go station in order. But the frequency of our newer customers was higher and is higher than the frequency of our existing customers. We are really happy with what we've done as Gene mentioned with the technology that we put in to go business. It is helping to get some younger people in our restaurants or to order to go what we've done with car side to go and curbside here has made it so much easier for people to come pick up. And so we feel really good about the customers we're getting and the information we're gleaning from them.\nJeff Farmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Gene, my first one is just that the comment about the 50% to 60% capacity in terms of following the CDC guidelines. As we look at restrictions easing across the country, do they \u2013 do they really matter or should we just really kind of think about just the overall guidance from the CDC, as we think about your capacity and increasing?\nGene Lee: Yes. I mean, I think it's a very interesting question. I think we're hoping the CDC comes along with the consumer and the consumer behavior. We feel right now; it's still prudent to follow that guidance. Then there may be a point where we determined that guidance is out of date. And I think with the consumer in a certain marketplace, but it's too early to tell. Right now we believe that the best course of action is to continue to follow the CDC guidelines. And just back on the 50% to 60% capacity one of the things you really lose in like on a LongHorn box is that those two or three deep standing at the bar waiting for tables that's not there. So that's kind of included in that lack of capacity that we have right now. We're still asking guests to wait outside and not corrugating our lobbies. So there's revenue that we're losing \u2013 we're losing there too. So I think here in the near term, I think it's \u2013 let's follow the CDC guidelines and let's see if some other leading indicators around COVID cases and the death rate continue to decline, and then we'll continue to reevaluate as we move forward.\nJake Bartlett: Got it. Thank you. And then I have a question about the fourth quarter guidance and maybe in the context of the weekly the same facility that you gave in the last week was obviously very strong and positive. I believe the guidance is implying, I'm still lower, I think about 8% or 9% lower average weekly sales in the fourth quarter versus 2019. So I think you're expecting the deceleration from current levels. Maybe if you can just talk about that in, if there was anything abnormal about this last week in relation to 2019?\nGene Lee: Well, yes, with the government \u2013 the government sent a bunch of chucks to a lot of people. I mean, you know, we use a lot of stimulus in the marketplace is that there's multiple variables that are transpiring, right? So we've got stimulus being sent out. We've got vaccinations increasing and we've got the virus declining. What we can't do is really tease out which one of those variables is driving this. We believe that stimulus is a really big part of maybe the backend of 2014 and weakening 2014 and the weekend 321. And so we don't have that stimulus in our outlook for the rest of the quarter. We know from history of that phage and this was a big, this was a big, this was a big stimulus package. So we'll see how long it lasts, but right now we're thinking that it tails here pretty quickly.\nJake Bartlett: Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks for the question. Just maybe a margin question. I think your guidance is implying, some of the \u2013 one of the highest EBITDA margins we've seen, possibly in some time. So can you maybe talk about what's one-time what's sustainable in terms of that guidance? Clearly there's some marketing savings and obviously the 150 basis points that we talked about in the G&A setting. But maybe you can go through that, and what part of the upside too recent trends \u2013 recent margin trends is sustainable going forward. Thanks. Yeah.\nRaj Vennam: Hi Eric, this is Raj. Thanks for the question. So when you think about the margin I think it depends on really where the sales levels are. And as I mentioned in the pre prepared remarks, there are some costs that have to come back into the P&L and that will come back, but it's not like we're going to ramp up those costs as fast as the sales are coming back here, right? So as you look at Q4; one, I want to point out Q4 generally is our highest or one of his higher, an EBITDA margin then the annual average combine that with the fact that we have this decent acceleration in sales from Q3 to Q4, and some of these costs we're talking about will come back over time as we go beyond Q4. And when you think about at the 90 plus percent sales levels, if you, not saying that he's the discrete cutoff, but if you think about it, that level it's really marketing and labor are two big contributors positively as a percent of sales. And then the offs \u2013 partially offset by food costs going up. That's where we have made some investments. We've all along made investments into the value proposition for the guests. And that we'll continue to do that too. So we feel like at those levels, marketing and labor will help food will take away from it. Personal expenses are probably going to be relatively flat, maybe a slightly off by 10 basis points. And then G&A, we should be flat at 90% given the reduction we've done on the G&A. As we grow from there we do think some of those sales will come \u2013 some of those costs will come back in. And I think we're still not saying the margins are going to go down any further, but we do want to maintain the 150 and see what we can do, but some of these things are going to play out based on the environment and the economic backdrop.\nEric Gonzalez: Thanks.\nOperator: Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. The primary question is just on the wage rates, obviously encouraging to see you seemingly setting a floor for the hourly team members. I'm just wondering how large of an investment is this $10 to assure all people make at least $10 an hour and be more broadly. Gene, what are your thoughts on the likelihood of more of a national hourly and tipped employee wage increase? Maybe you can just share what your approach has been in terms of pricing or profitability in the states that are already out these at these elevated levels. And then I had one follow-up?\nGene Lee: Hey, good morning, Jeff. We're not going to \u2013 we'll all say about the cost of this is covered in our guidance. And we're not going to get into the specific costs of implementing this program. As far as wage rates are nationally, I mean, there's a lot of momentum here. I think that there's momentum for a bipartisan group to get to a solution that, I think everybody can live with. I think that our focus is more on protecting the tip wage. We think that is \u2013 we think that is extremely important for the overall restaurant business, we think it's extremely important for both constituents. The server doesn't want that relationship to change with the consumer and the consumer doesn't want that relationship to change with the server. And so our focus and working with the powers to be is explaining how this relationship works and the importance of this relationship. And I would point to the fact that our average server earn or our average tipped employee earns greater than $20 per hour. And you think that's an average, so you think about as these servers develop their skill set and become \u2013 and their capabilities and become very competent. They have the opportunity to earn well above $20 per hour once they become proficient at what they're doing, and I think that's important to note. I also think it's very important to note that if the tip wage was to be eliminated, the current compensation model for servers would have to change. The industry would change that, the way people are compensated and it's my belief over time that those people would be compensated less, not more. On wage, I would just end with that, I believe that we're really well positioned to manage through any changes here. We've been able \u2013 we've been managing structural wage changes for years, and we do that to improve productivity. We do that through pricing, but we've been able to manage that effectively, and I believe that we're well positioned to manage whatever changes come out of Washington or out of the individual states as we move forward.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just to follow-up \u2013 just as you mentioned marketing as one of the big helps in terms of the margin opportunity. I'm just wondering, I think you said it was down $50-plus million in the third quarter or a couple of hundred basis points. Just wondering how you're thinking about that recovery, whether it's the fiscal fourth quarter or just qualitatively, how you think about fiscal 2022? Maybe your thoughts on various marketing channels for investment or whether there are some permanent savings opportunities as maybe you shift away from some of the more expensive channels? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes, Jeff, I think right now the way we're thinking about is we don't have any definitive plans as we move forward. We really need to understand what the competitive environment is. And then we have to really evaluate all the different channels and which is the most effective channel for each of the businesses, which I believe are very different. And then we'll have to, if we need to layer it back in, we'll have to make the decision on what's the highest ROI investment that we can make for each of the businesses. And so we have \u2013 we have some contingency plans are redeveloped. We know what levers would pull in different environments. But right now we think we're spending at the appropriate level. We're still spending some good money in Olive Garden. We bought the up fronts. We're still running some very good television. I really liked the creative; I think the team's done a very good job on the creative. And so I think we're getting across great messaging. So it's not like we've cut all advertising. We're still in some digital channels. We're still spending money on search. We think we're spending at the appropriate levels right now, and we'll continue to evaluate as we move forward.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nChris Carril: Hi, good morning. So clearly you've used the opportunity over the last year to find efficiencies in the business and lean further into digital. How are you thinking about the composition of your brand portfolio now longer term in the context of all the improvements that you've discussed recently? And again this morning and how an enterprise level you're position to potentially add brands and further leverage the scale of bandages you've built?\nGene Lee: Yes. We love our brands today. I think that some of our brands that were, maybe I wouldn't say they're underperforming, they may be underperforming our expectations because against the broader competitive set they were at the midpoint or even better than that. But the moves that were made and the structural changes to these business has this really excited and more \u2013 and we think more about growth for some of our brands that probably didn't hadn't earned the right to have a lot of new capital invested in them because the returns weren't as competitive inside our portfolio. And we had better alternatives, that's going to change a little bit. So we're a little \u2013 we're more excited about the potential growth of these brands. As far as M&A goes, I mean, I know I'm going to give you the standard answer that we continue to have conversations with a board and look at opportunities, and I really can't say much more than that on that subject at this point.\nChris Carril: Thank you.\nOperator: James Rutherford with Stephens. Your line is open.\nJames Rutherford: Thanks Gene. As guests started to come back into your restaurants, had you noticed any differences in their behavior or they lingering longer ordering more drinks and appetizers more or less expensive entrees, et cetera. I'm just kind of wondering if there's any noteworthy changes to guests behavior that you're seeing as a pattern.\nGene Lee: No. I don't think it's any noteworthy behavior. I mean, I think in certain markets people \u2013 it's amazing people get their vaccination. The first thing they do is they go to a restaurant, even though there's probably should wait a few days for the vaccination to be. But I mean, there's just, I mean, there are a lot of people that this is, we're noticing especially near vaccination sites, that this is their first time out in a year, and they're just so excited to be back. And it just, you can tell because you see in some larger groups of senior citizens that just happy to be back out, having a dining experience. So no major changes, other than people are happy. I mean, people are happy to be out and it's definitely noticeable. There's a good vibes in our restaurants right now.\nJames Rutherford: Well, that's great to hear. And as a follow-up on curbside, can you give an update on how much of your system is offering curbside today and the initiatives around, I think geo-fencing, dedicated doors to the kitchen or any of the things you're doing to make this hyper convenient channel kind of even better than it is today?\nRick Cardenas: Hey James, this is Rick. On the curbside experience, all of our brands are offering curbside. Now there might be a few restaurants here and there that might be within in malls, et cetera, that it's hard to do, but all of our restaurants offer curbside today. They all have the curbside, I'm here feature where you can text \u2013 well you'll get a text 10 minutes before their pick-up time to tell the restaurant that they're here. And so they all have that. Once we implement a technology that works, we blow it out in all the restaurants. As regards to kind of the building design and change, we are looking at some changes to prototypes as we build new restaurants, to make it a little bit more convenient for our team to bring the food out to the cars. But there is still a high percentage of people that are picking up in the restaurant that maybe ordering the restaurant and pick-up, or they just want to walk in and maybe sit at the bar for a minute to watch TV. And while they're to go is being prepared. So we have to keep an in-restaurant type of experience for them as well. So we're looking at that. In regards to making a bunch of modifications to our existing restaurants, we're thinking about that as we see our restaurants start to build back-up in the dining room. We're just trying to figure out the most efficient way to make changes, whether it's in the kitchen to give them more, more room for packaging, but maybe not having a side door, because we do believe that the guests may still want to come in. So we're working through that. We don't expect to make huge, huge investments in our restaurant \u2013 existing restaurants where to go. We do have some investments to make, but they're not that great.\nJames Rutherford: Excellent. Thank you very much.\nOperator: David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning, everyone. My question is for Raj. I wanted to come back to your comments about costs coming back into the business after the current quarter. And I wanted to understand the implications of that, and are you saying that the math you've laid out with margins of 150 basis points higher at 90% of your prior sales volumes? Will that still hold as these costs come back into the business? Are you going to need higher volumes as per Q4 to hit that 150 basis point bogey? \nRaj Vennam: No. David, I think we were actually expecting to maintain that margin, so we don't need higher volume to get to that. And then as volume grows, we're saying, we're committed to maintaining that as costs come back in, but we don't think we're going to be diluting margin that 150 basis points is sticky.\nDavid Tarantino: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then I guess my real question then is; how do you see that developing if sales end up going back to 100% or more of what you had previously? I know you're committed to maintaining the 150, but it's our line of sight or a path to exceeding that as more sales flow through the model. And I guess how do you balance that with the investments that you might want to make to sustain the health of the brand longer term?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, I think that's a great question David. I think the way we're thinking about it is as sales grow, we'll find opportunities to make more investments into guest experience, into food quality. Thinks that we want to do, and we also have talked about trying to price \u2013 continuing to price below inflation and below competition. That's one of our bigger investments that we make. Could you see for a time period where our margins exceed and build off of that? Absolutely. But I think longer term; I think the way we're thinking about it is we don't want it to grow too much. We want to just kind of find ways to set us up for longer-term market share gains, but still have a pretty robust business model.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. All make sense. Thank you.\nOperator: John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJohn Glass: Hey, thanks very much. I had a question about unit development in your 2022 outlook. Now, given what you said about your success of margin improvement at Cheddar's, what you've seen at Olive Garden, why wouldn't development be faster, I guess specifically as you look at 2022 is sort of a stepping stone to faster in 2023. Is there external constraints on development or is this just internal decision as fast as you want to grow? And since you brought up Cheddar's specifically, right that thesis \u2013 when buying it was, this is a really big growth vehicle for the company. How do you think about development now that Cheddar's margins are better? How many of those 35 are Cheddar's and what do you think that brand can \u2013 what the pace of that bank growth can be thereafter?\nGene Lee: Well, this is a couple of couple of questions, John. Driving our ability to only get 35 restaurants next year. Number one, we \u2013 as we entered into COVID, we dismantled the whole development team. And so we spent the last 90 days to 120 days rebuilding that. But that's really not the driving and limiting factor as we move forward next year. The limiting factor is that after we get past letter of intent, every step along the way, and that development process is pretty much slowed down significantly. And it has a lot to do with, people working remotely and we're not able to negotiate a lease as quickly as we once were, but the biggest hang up right now is permitting and getting your plans through permit and getting approvals that you need, getting people out to do your inspections so that you can move along. So I think, the way I would answer is there's external factors that are limiting us, being able to open more restaurants. We have the letters of intent signed. We're just struggled past that point and we hope that we can get to 23. We can get to the higher end of our 2% to 3%. We believe our pipeline is in good enough shape to get there. There's enough availability out there, and we're happy with the construct of the deals. But once we get to pass letter of intent, this thing really slows down significantly and really out of our control. Now I'll just add that over the last couple of weeks, things are starting to pick up a little bit in the local municipalities, and we're starting to get some things done, but we're sitting on a restaurant today that we can't get open, because we're waiting on that last inspection and there's no sense of urgency and that local community to get out there and make that last inspection. As far as Cheddar's, I think the limiter on Cheddar's \u2013 we're thrilled with the business model. The limiter on Cheddar's will still be the human resources. We've got to build the bench strength so that we can get that system up and running. There's a tremendous amount of backfill opportunity. We're seeing the benefits of the backfill opportunity, whereas we're opening some of these new restaurants that we've opened here recently. And so, hopefully we can get Cheddar's somewhere between 7% and 10% unit growth once we get everything to where we want it to be. And I think the benefit of our platform is that we don't have to overtax one of our businesses to get growth. And I always say [indiscernible], and we want to be able to grow this thing responsibly and open great restaurants with great operations, high volume concept that we've simplified, but still difficult to run. Just one last comment on the growth is that, with the transformation of the business model, we think the big upside now is that there's more Olive Gardens than what we may have originally thought. We can handle the cannibalization a lot better today than we could before. And therefore we want to push a little bit harder on Olive Garden and we think, and the returns are just fantastic in that business. So that\u2019s the best place to put our capital.\nJohn Glass: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nLauren Silberman: Thanks for the question. I also wanted to ask about the labor investments that you're now specific to the hourly wage increase at least $10. What percentage of your hourly employee base will be impacted by this initiative? I guess what percentage is currently below 10? And does this affect only non-tipped employees? And then are you increasing wages at a commensurate rate across the board?\nGene Lee: We don't plan to \u2013 I'll start backwards on this. We don't think there's going to have a \u2013 be a big compression issue. The amount of people this impacts is small. We're not going to give the exact number. And again, as I talked about earlier, it's included in our guidance for the quarter and we included for next year though and what we'll disclose what our wage inflation we're projected to be when we give you 2022 guidance. And it's for all employees. It's basically, if you're a tipped employee, in your tips and your wage doesn't get you to $10, we'll bring you to $10 an hour.\nLauren Silberman: Okay. Yes. I just \u2013 I figured that this was primarily going to impact non-tip, because I think generally makes more sense to kind of confirm that. But my follow-up question to that is \u2013 how does your hourly staffing level today compared to pre-COVID levels? I guess January what percentage of your hourly employees you have in the restaurants right now?\nGene Lee: We have \u2013 I haven't seen the number for last week. But the week before, we were at a home about 115,000 versus 165,000 active pre-COVID. And that number is increasing every week. And I think our greatest challenge right now is staffing. It's staffing, trying to attract people to come to work. That's why we're strengthening our employment proposition, which is already strong. We've got to staff it. We've got to train people. We'll train people now in a very high volume environment. And so, as I really think about what we're focused on is really Back-to-Basics restaurant operations. And part of that \u2013 one of those things that we focus on there is hiring great people and having great certified trainers that are able to train those people, to bring our brands to life. And so that's our number one, that's really a number one priority right now.\nLauren Silberman: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Your line is open.\nBrett Levy: Great. Thanks for taking the call. If we could follow-up on James' question earlier, what are you seeing from a demographic standpoint given that you guys go up and down the average check continuum? Obviously, we've seen what the LongHorn and the Olive Garden numbers look like. But if you could give us just a little bit more clarity into and color into what you're seeing across different demographics and I'll have a follow-up also.\nGene Lee: Yes, I'll just comment on fine dining. Obviously, that's coming back a little bit slower. I would say that fine dining in Suburbia is performing much better than fine dining in the central business districts. We are incredibly impressed with the weekend business in fine dining, even in the central business district. So this business is coming back, it's coming \u2013 we're going to be extremely profitable in this business. But this is going to definitely come back slower than casual. And so there's \u2013 I will just add that we've been pretty impressed the last couple of weeks, how this business has rebounded.\nBrett Levy: And then just other for Rick or for Raj. When you think about the structural margin, pre-crisis obviously you were one of the industry stalwarts and you're \u2013 you've found efficiencies within the model. When you think two, three, five years out, what do you think is the potential for where you can get to versus where you were pre? And thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Yes, I think it would be tough for me to sit here and project out five years from now what we think the number could be. But all I'll say is we are definitely committed to getting to this 150. And then beyond that, we still go back to our long-term framework once the \u2013 once we get back to the sales levels we had before, it's about that 10 to 30 basis points margin improvement every year. And we think we can still do that.\nBrett Levy: Thank you.\nOperator: Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Your line is open.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you, and good morning. On the CapEx guidance, if I have this right, the number of new stores came down a little bit, but the CapEx is going to be towards the high end of the range. Are you finding incremental projects to spend behind this year? I'm just looking for a little bit of color there. And then, somewhat related a question on technology given all the success that you've had on the digital side, and the ability to kind of look at the business holistically through this last year. Are you identifying or exploring different ways to leverage technology kind of going forward? I'm just curious how we should expect technology to be implemented either from a guest facing or kind of internal perspective over time? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: All right. Just let me answer the CapEx one. I'll hand it over to Rick on the technology stuff. So from a CapEx perspective, when you think about our annual CapEx, we're already spending money for next year\u2019s new units, right. So that's why you don't really see CapEx move much, because we're still working on our pipeline, we're still working on next year. The other thing I want to remind you is this year spend is relatively low because some of these units were already built earlier. We spent a lot of CapEx last year, and then we were sitting on these restaurants because when the pandemic hit. So that's the color on CapEx. And then Rick?\nRick Cardenas: Thanks, Raj. On the technology front, we are in the process of doing another three-year roadmap for technology. We're going to continue to invest in technology to reduce friction in the guest experience and reduce friction and the team member experience. We've given you some examples of what we've already done this year with shifting everything to curbside, going to Curbside I'm Here. We're actually going to make that process even easier as we keep going forward. We're going to make the process of checking into your \u2013 to the restaurant easier. We're doing a lot of things going forward. Without getting into too much detail, we expect to spend more money in technology than we have this year, and we continue to invest in technology. We think it's an advantage for us. It gives us better access to data, and because of our scale, we can do it.\nAndrew Strelzik: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nNicole Miller: Thank you. Good morning. Two quick questions. The first, on being data rich typically guest satisfaction scores are a leading indicator of comp. But if we back that up, I guess I can imagine it's a satisfied employee serving that guest. So maybe you could compare and contrast the metrics that you look at that are, I guess, external for guest satisfaction versus internal for employee satisfaction. And perhaps that was tied to or grounded hourly wage changes that you discussed today. Thanks,\nRick Cardenas: Nicole. This is Rick. I'll start with the guest satisfaction metrics. All our brands are improving their guest satisfaction year-over-year from pre-COVID, even with especially because of all of the things that we've done to simplify our business to make it easier for our restaurants to get the product to what they \u2013 get the product to the consumer in the way they want it. We're shifting more of our sales to our top 10 items, which are high satisfaction items. We've improved significantly to go experience, which at the beginning was a pretty low satisfying experience. It's getting better every week. So on the guest side, all the satisfaction measures look great. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks on to go, Olive Garden was at an all time high for on-time and accurate premise experience for the third quarter, even though it was a really high off-premise quarter for them with three big holidays. In the employee metrics, the metric that we look at the most is turnover and our turnover has been great over the last year. And as Gene mentioned, we just introduced another thing to help the employee experience and their process of coming to work for us. We're going to simplify the hiring process as we go forward, but we have just great, a great employment proposition, which leads to our turnover. Those are the two metrics we look at the most. The last thing I'll say, is there some external metrics that we're really proud of for LongHorn? They're now number one in food quality and food taste with all of the investments they made over the last few years. And that's a pretty high bar for us. And we feel really good about the investments they've made and that's what's driving our performance.\nNicole Miller: Thank you for that color. And then I think you had mentioned six openings if I wrote that down, I think the question still stands, you talked about exceeding expectations and I want to understand, how much of that is the strategic operational control and excellence you have, and how much was that influenced by the external competitive landscape. And when you first looked at those stores, perhaps there's competitors that just didn't make it across the finish line and didn't open. So how would you compare and contrast that? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Nicole thanks for that. If we look at the six restaurants that we opened in the quarter, and actually restaurants will open this year, their sales levels have been higher than we thought considering we opened some of these restaurants at really hard, 50% capacity limitations. Now that could be because other restaurants didn't open, but we've been performing really well. If you look at our guest satisfaction measures in those restaurants, we've done a really good job in training our people and getting open. And then the other thing, though, I think a bigger part of our performance is actually at the bottom line of the P&L. And these restaurants are performing much better on their P&L than restaurants that we opened a year or two before. And that's because of the simplifications that we have made. Whenever you simplify you really to make it easy for new restaurants, right. When they open, if they open with a full menu and a pretty big dining room, it's hard for them. When they opened with a menu that we have today with a dining room that's a little bit constrained. It makes it easier, but we've also changed some of our training programs, especially in the fine dining brands to make it almost like you're coming into a restaurant that's always been there. And so we've done a really good job in improving the process to open new restaurants. So I would give it \u2013 I would give that much more of the benefit than another restaurant or two that not didn't open during that time.\nNicole Miller: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJared Garber: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on maybe comments from last quarter, and as we're thinking about market share opportunities going forward. Gene, are you still thinking that 5% to 15% closure rate on the independent side makes sense, and just wanted to get your thoughts on three months later on how that that environment continues to kind of play out and relatedly, you made some comments on Olive Garden and maybe some more opportunities there. Several years ago, you guys put out some data on a longer-term TAM of, I think, it was 900 to 950 and some TAM on LongHorn as well. How should we be thinking about those opportunities going forward over the long term?\nGene Lee: Yes, first of all, on capacity, I think the last printed thing I saw from Technomic was still 5% to 15% tilted toward the higher end. It's my belief that the restaurants in central business districts will get recapitalized a lot \u2013 and be able to come back a lot quicker than what we'll see in Suburbia. And so, I think that there's population is still growing. And just the fact that a lot of new restaurants are going to \u2013 aren't going to be added are also a benefit as we go forward. So I think as far as the capacity part of it, it's still a real good tailwind for the industry. As far as \u2013 what was the number one\u2026.\nJared Garber: Yes, the TAM opportunity. Yes.\nGene Lee: I think that would \u2013 as you think about that, we're not ready to put a number out there right now. We want to \u2013 the way we think about development is we find the best piece of property that we can find. And then we try to put, what do we think is the best you what \u2013 which restaurant in our brand and our portfolio will maximize the opportunity of that piece of land. And so I think numbers will ebb and flow. But we believe in the next few out years, we're going to get closer to 3% of our framework. That's where we want to be.\nOperator: John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. Obviously, you guys accomplished so much in 2020 around digital efficient marketing, restaurant operations, reorganization, G&A efficiency, so much, maybe that would have taken you three to five years. Have you been ever to get to some of the metrics that you got, so Gene maybe, this is a question for you and the Board, how are your strategic priorities changing if at all? I mean, as you accomplish so much, that you hope to accomplish over the next three to five years, that some of these initiatives are not fully behind you, at least partially behind you, what might be like the next big ideas that Darden is working on?\nGene Lee: Well, I'm not sure what the next big idea is. I think the big thing that we're really cognizant of is how do we fight the gravity to pull us back \u2013 pulling us back towards, what had worked extremely well for us and staying, keeping our eye on the prize of all the gains that we made over the last few year. So I think right now, more importantly than ever, the way I'm thinking about it is Back-to-Basics. We've got to run great restaurants. We've got to be able to execute our food, our service and great atmosphere is if we can do that. I think I always say this simple term. How do we do less better? And I think right now we put our businesses through significant change and I'm in this do less better framework. I want to make sure that we're running great, great restaurants. Strategically, I think the way we're \u2013 we continue to think about it is how do we ensure we get, take this opportunity to get our top line growth to 3%, which is a number we haven't really achieved yet. And 3% doesn't sound like a lot, but that's a lot of new restaurants in our system, absolute numbers, right. When you start adding 50 to 70 restaurants a year that puts a lot of strain on your organization and puts a lot of strain on your human resources. So I like this whole notion of getting narrower, not a lot of strategic change, but let's get into execute, execute, execute. I believe our brands are differentiated enough right now to compete effectively. And it's not a lot of work to be done there.\nJohn Ivankoe: Great answer. Thanks Gene.\nOperator: Andrew Barish with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAndrew Barish: Hey guys. I'm sorry if I missed it. But I know you've kind of taking a look at the fluid competitive situation, and it doesn't appear as if it's changing your philosophy on, kind of using price as an investment or pricing below the industry. Can you give us what you're maybe looking at going forward for 2022 or so for the two big brands at least in terms of menu pricing?\nGene Lee: Andy, I think it's a little premature to signal what we think that is. I think I would, based on what \u2013 if we start now, I would look at what our norms have been. But one of the things that, we\u2019ve got to \u2013 we'll have to consider is in this dynamic environment, is what do we think inflation is going to be? And it's too early for us to really understand what we think inflation is going to be in our fiscal 2022. So I would just look \u2013 if you're looking for guidance on that, I would look more towards our historical norms at this point.\nAndrew Barish: Okay. And then a quick follow-up Raj, just on the underlying kind of G&A number, last couple of quarters it's been that $85 million to $90 million, is that a decent run rate going forward at this point, or are we missing some reinvestment back into the business that may come into that line?\nRaj Vennam: I'd say at this point, think up somewhere around $90 million as a good run rate to start with. And then if that changes, we'll let you know in June. But I think at that point somewhere around $90 million is a good number.\nAndrew Barish: Okay. Thanks folks.\nOperator: Howard Penney with Hedgeye. Your line is open.\nHoward Penney: Thank you so much for the question. My \u2013 the second \u2013 the next quarter, you \u2013 this consensus estimate is for somewhere around 65% comp, which implies sort of a two-year 10% stack, managing the business in a normal year to see 10% growth would be incredible. I would love to hear about how you're managing that kind of acceleration in \u2013 I'm not asking about the comp and whether it's good, just sort of from a middle of the P&L, how do you hire for that and how do you purchase really like how do you manage a business that goes from sort of zero to 60, if you will in comps. Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes. Good morning, Howard. I think that's why I'm trying to narrow the focus of the organization and then really focusing on the Back-to-Basics and trying to eliminate any distraction at all. And I believe that, the priorities right now, especially over the next six to nine months is staffing. How do you ensure your supply chain is growing with the demand and all those other basic things that, that go on every day. And part of why we're making this investment today in our people is to say, thank you, and also to be \u2013 to recruit. We know the people best that the teams with the best people will win in this environment. And we need to attract great people, offer them great opportunities, provide careers for them. But you've identified what our operation \u2013 operating priorities are. Rick in the presence and really need to focus on this. We're monitoring the number of employees in each restaurant every single week. We're monitoring today, the number of servers in each restaurant every day. So we understand, what our staffing levels are and what we need to do to support that. Doug Milanes, our Head of Supply Chain has done an incredible job keeping the supply chain full and keeping that continuity. We also have a lot of sensitive products that we serve. They have to be aged appropriately, which they've done a great job on. And so, we're focused on \u2013 you highlighted our biggest challenge. It's not strategic today, it\u2019s operational.\nHoward Penney: And you didn't mention training. Is there any incremental training associated with that? Are you going to bring back people that you familiar with the organization? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Well, I think, we're going to do both. We're going to try to bring back anybody that's familiar with the organization. But right now I think most of who we're bringing back, well, maybe the exception of California is new people. And so what we do in that circumstance? We've really, we have a certified trainer program that we were able to really energize and connect with these people that are actually doing the training of the new employees in every one of our brands. And they're the key. We've got to give them the tools and the time and the compensation in order to be able to train these new people effectively. And you're pressing on some of the biggest operational challenges as we've ramped this back up. And I think it's right to highlight that. And we're \u2013 I think we're going to \u2013 our teams are going to be up for the task.\nOperator: Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBrian Vaccaro: Thanks. Just two quick ones for me. On advertising, I'm curious if there's been any change in your thinking as to when it makes sense to begin increasing your spend again it's not many, but it seems like a few chains have either have, or soon will be ramping their spend. So just wondering if that is at all impacting your thinking and sorry if I missed it, Raj, but can you ballpark the level of spend that's embedded in your fiscal 4Q guide?\nGene Lee: As far as, I mean, and I talked a little bit about this earlier Brian, is we just have no definitive plans right now. And on what we're going to put back in or how we're going to put back in and which channel we're going to put back in advertising. We've got to look at the competitive environment. We've got to see where we're at. I think each brand will come back differently and use different channels that are more effective for them. We're still spending a good amount of money in Olive Garden on advertising today. We bought a lot of television in the upfront. We think that's an effective medium for us. And so we'll continue to spend that. I'm very happy with the creative. And so, this is what I would call a game time decision. We will \u2013 when it's right to call that play, we'll call that play. But right now we have no definitive plans to do that.\nRaj Vennam: And Brian, just for Q4 ballpark, I would expect similar levels as Q3, somewhere around $25 million.\nBrian Vaccaro: Okay, great. And then I also just wanted to touch base on the commodity outlook. What are your expectations over the next few quarters from an inflation perspective? And you can touch on some of the more significant puts and takes within your basket?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. We're not ready to get into fiscal 2022 yet, but I will tell you in fiscal \u2013 for Q4, we do expect our commodity inflation to be a little bit higher at around 2% for the entire basket with, I think there's a little bit more in chicken, and there's a little bit more in \u2013 actually oil is one where we think it's going to be pretty high. There are multitude of factors that are impacting oil, as you might already be aware, but those are the ones I can call out.\nBrian Vaccaro: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Kevin Kalicak for final remarks.\nKevin Kalicak: Great. Thanks, Jack. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind everyone, we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 24 before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks again for participating today.\nOperator: This concludes the Darden fiscal year 2021 third quarter earnings call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gene Lee",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. It's hard to believe it's been a year since the pandemic began to significantly impact our business. When I reflect back on everything that has transpired, it is clear to me the strategy we developed six years ago provided a strong foundation to help us navigate this period of unprecedented change and uncertainty. Our portfolio of iconic brands has been focused on executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy while leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results oriented culture. And while our four competitive advantages were critical to our business and operational success this past year, our significant scale and results oriented culture have played an outsized role in our ability to emerge stronger. Our significant scale enabled us to quickly react to the turbulent operating environment. The depth and breadth of our supply chain relationships ensured that we could adjust our product supply as needed without experiencing any significant interruptions. We have our own dedicated distribution network, and the assurance of an uninterrupted supply chain provided consistency and a high level of certainty for our operators. Our scale also enabled us to significantly accelerate the development of online ordering and several other digital initiatives and cascade them across our brands quickly and effectively. The robust expansion of our digital platform over the past year has provided us a richer set of first-party data on new and existing guest. Finally, our scale provided us with multiple levers to pull to ensure we have the liquidity we needed during the early days of COVID-19. As soon as our liquidity needs were solved for, our brands were able to focus on strengthening their value propositions and transforming their business models. As our Founder, Bill Darden said, the greatest competitive advantage our company has is the quality of our employees evidenced by the excellent job they do every day. Throughout this past year, Darden and our brands have emerged stronger and our success is a direct result of our team members and their relentless commitment to delivering safe and exceptional guest experiences. That is why we've continued to invest in our team members throughout the past year. Since March of 2020, we've invested more than $200 million in our people through programs such as paid sick leave. COVID-19 emergency pay and covering insurance payments and benefit deductions for team members who were furloughed. These investments also include our recent decision to provide all hourly restaurant team members up to four hours of paid time off for the purpose of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, these investments include the one-time bonus we announced today totaling approximately $17 million, which will impact nearly 90,000 hourly team members. As we continue to grow our business and welcome guests back into our restaurants, continuing to attract and retain the best talent in the industry will be critical to our success. While we're proud that on average, our hourly restaurant team members earn more than $17 per hour today, which includes our servers and bartenders who earn more than $20 an hour. I'm excited about the announcement we made this morning. Beginning Monday, every hourly team member tipped and non-tipped will earn at least $10 per hour, inclusive of tip income. Additionally, we are committed to raising that amount to $11 per hour in January 2022 and to $12 per hour in January 2023. These investments further strengthen our industry leading employment proposition. Lastly, I continue to be impressed and inspired by our team members who have shown extraordinary resilience and passion during the past year. Once again, I thank you for your commitment to delivering exceptional guest experiences in our dining room and through curbside to go. You are the heart and soul of our company. And on behalf of the management team, we're extremely grateful to you. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. Good morning, David. Yes, the labor investments we made is embedded in the 150 basis points improvement. We think we can make at 90% of sales; so that is inclusive there. We'll talk about the dining capacity. Basically, the way our dinings are laid out, LongHorn has an advantage over Olive Garden and its utilization because of the number of boosts. But the way to think about it is, we're somewhere between 50% and 60% capacity inside the dining room depending on the particular four plan, and so there's still limitations of availability inside our restaurants. As long as we're following the CDC guidelines, it doesn't matter what the local municipalities are doing. And we believe right now, it's in our best interest, our team members' best interest with the priority of their health and safety for our team members and our guests to continue to follow the CDC guidelines. And so we think about our dining room somewhere between 50% and 60%, 65% depending on the individual floor plan off premise stickiness. Let me just \u2013 let me start off by saying, I am incredibly impressed with what our team has done to improve our capabilities in the off-premise experience. The digital experience is getting better every single day, it's being adopted, I thought in Rick's prepared remarks, he talked about 19% of our total sales now being digital. I think that's really impressive. I do believe that as more as we get to offer more capacity and we see this in individual restaurants that the off premise will start to fall off. I think why the capacity is limited, and there's still a lot of people out there that aren't fully vaccinated. There's still good demand for the off premise. I believe that because of our capabilities that we've developed during the pandemic and our vision for how those capabilities will continue to improve in the future, that our off-premise business will still be robust when it's all said and done. I can't tell you today what that percentage is going to be. Well, obviously we're only at 25% capacity in California, which is \u2013 that's pretty restrictive there. So, yes, our takeout percentage is higher in California. So I would say it's still pressure on the coast, both coasts, especially the North \u2013 Northeast part of the country. You're still seeing mobility, not as great as it is and what I would call from Arizona all the way over to Carolinas where I think mobility is much greater and the consumer is much more willing to get out and move around. So there's difference in sales there. But every day, I mean, this is very dynamic folks. This is changing daily as more and more people get vaccinated, more and more people get become confident in their ability to be mobile. And it's getting to the point where, I think we're cautiously optimistic and excited about what's going to transpire here over the next few months and maybe few years. Yes. I mean, I think it's a very interesting question. I think we're hoping the CDC comes along with the consumer and the consumer behavior. We feel right now; it's still prudent to follow that guidance. Then there may be a point where we determined that guidance is out of date. And I think with the consumer in a certain marketplace, but it's too early to tell. Right now we believe that the best course of action is to continue to follow the CDC guidelines. And just back on the 50% to 60% capacity one of the things you really lose in like on a LongHorn box is that those two or three deep standing at the bar waiting for tables that's not there. So that's kind of included in that lack of capacity that we have right now. We're still asking guests to wait outside and not corrugating our lobbies. So there's revenue that we're losing \u2013 we're losing there too. So I think here in the near term, I think it's \u2013 let's follow the CDC guidelines and let's see if some other leading indicators around COVID cases and the death rate continue to decline, and then we'll continue to reevaluate as we move forward. Well, yes, with the government \u2013 the government sent a bunch of chucks to a lot of people. I mean, you know, we use a lot of stimulus in the marketplace is that there's multiple variables that are transpiring, right? So we've got stimulus being sent out. We've got vaccinations increasing and we've got the virus declining. What we can't do is really tease out which one of those variables is driving this. We believe that stimulus is a really big part of maybe the backend of 2014 and weakening 2014 and the weekend 321. And so we don't have that stimulus in our outlook for the rest of the quarter. We know from history of that phage and this was a big, this was a big, this was a big stimulus package. So we'll see how long it lasts, but right now we're thinking that it tails here pretty quickly. Hey, good morning, Jeff. We're not going to \u2013 we'll all say about the cost of this is covered in our guidance. And we're not going to get into the specific costs of implementing this program. As far as wage rates are nationally, I mean, there's a lot of momentum here. I think that there's momentum for a bipartisan group to get to a solution that, I think everybody can live with. I think that our focus is more on protecting the tip wage. We think that is \u2013 we think that is extremely important for the overall restaurant business, we think it's extremely important for both constituents. The server doesn't want that relationship to change with the consumer and the consumer doesn't want that relationship to change with the server. And so our focus and working with the powers to be is explaining how this relationship works and the importance of this relationship. And I would point to the fact that our average server earn or our average tipped employee earns greater than $20 per hour. And you think that's an average, so you think about as these servers develop their skill set and become \u2013 and their capabilities and become very competent. They have the opportunity to earn well above $20 per hour once they become proficient at what they're doing, and I think that's important to note. I also think it's very important to note that if the tip wage was to be eliminated, the current compensation model for servers would have to change. The industry would change that, the way people are compensated and it's my belief over time that those people would be compensated less, not more. On wage, I would just end with that, I believe that we're really well positioned to manage through any changes here. We've been able \u2013 we've been managing structural wage changes for years, and we do that to improve productivity. We do that through pricing, but we've been able to manage that effectively, and I believe that we're well positioned to manage whatever changes come out of Washington or out of the individual states as we move forward. Yes, Jeff, I think right now the way we're thinking about is we don't have any definitive plans as we move forward. We really need to understand what the competitive environment is. And then we have to really evaluate all the different channels and which is the most effective channel for each of the businesses, which I believe are very different. And then we'll have to, if we need to layer it back in, we'll have to make the decision on what's the highest ROI investment that we can make for each of the businesses. And so we have \u2013 we have some contingency plans are redeveloped. We know what levers would pull in different environments. But right now we think we're spending at the appropriate level. We're still spending some good money in Olive Garden. We bought the up fronts. We're still running some very good television. I really liked the creative; I think the team's done a very good job on the creative. And so I think we're getting across great messaging. So it's not like we've cut all advertising. We're still in some digital channels. We're still spending money on search. We think we're spending at the appropriate levels right now, and we'll continue to evaluate as we move forward. Yes. We love our brands today. I think that some of our brands that were, maybe I wouldn't say they're underperforming, they may be underperforming our expectations because against the broader competitive set they were at the midpoint or even better than that. But the moves that were made and the structural changes to these business has this really excited and more \u2013 and we think more about growth for some of our brands that probably didn't hadn't earned the right to have a lot of new capital invested in them because the returns weren't as competitive inside our portfolio. And we had better alternatives, that's going to change a little bit. So we're a little \u2013 we're more excited about the potential growth of these brands. As far as M&A goes, I mean, I know I'm going to give you the standard answer that we continue to have conversations with a board and look at opportunities, and I really can't say much more than that on that subject at this point. No. I don't think it's any noteworthy behavior. I mean, I think in certain markets people \u2013 it's amazing people get their vaccination. The first thing they do is they go to a restaurant, even though there's probably should wait a few days for the vaccination to be. But I mean, there's just, I mean, there are a lot of people that this is, we're noticing especially near vaccination sites, that this is their first time out in a year, and they're just so excited to be back. And it just, you can tell because you see in some larger groups of senior citizens that just happy to be back out, having a dining experience. So no major changes, other than people are happy. I mean, people are happy to be out and it's definitely noticeable. There's a good vibes in our restaurants right now. Well, this is a couple of couple of questions, John. Driving our ability to only get 35 restaurants next year. Number one, we \u2013 as we entered into COVID, we dismantled the whole development team. And so we spent the last 90 days to 120 days rebuilding that. But that's really not the driving and limiting factor as we move forward next year. The limiting factor is that after we get past letter of intent, every step along the way, and that development process is pretty much slowed down significantly. And it has a lot to do with, people working remotely and we're not able to negotiate a lease as quickly as we once were, but the biggest hang up right now is permitting and getting your plans through permit and getting approvals that you need, getting people out to do your inspections so that you can move along. So I think, the way I would answer is there's external factors that are limiting us, being able to open more restaurants. We have the letters of intent signed. We're just struggled past that point and we hope that we can get to 23. We can get to the higher end of our 2% to 3%. We believe our pipeline is in good enough shape to get there. There's enough availability out there, and we're happy with the construct of the deals. But once we get to pass letter of intent, this thing really slows down significantly and really out of our control. Now I'll just add that over the last couple of weeks, things are starting to pick up a little bit in the local municipalities, and we're starting to get some things done, but we're sitting on a restaurant today that we can't get open, because we're waiting on that last inspection and there's no sense of urgency and that local community to get out there and make that last inspection. As far as Cheddar's, I think the limiter on Cheddar's \u2013 we're thrilled with the business model. The limiter on Cheddar's will still be the human resources. We've got to build the bench strength so that we can get that system up and running. There's a tremendous amount of backfill opportunity. We're seeing the benefits of the backfill opportunity, whereas we're opening some of these new restaurants that we've opened here recently. And so, hopefully we can get Cheddar's somewhere between 7% and 10% unit growth once we get everything to where we want it to be. And I think the benefit of our platform is that we don't have to overtax one of our businesses to get growth. And I always say [indiscernible], and we want to be able to grow this thing responsibly and open great restaurants with great operations, high volume concept that we've simplified, but still difficult to run. Just one last comment on the growth is that, with the transformation of the business model, we think the big upside now is that there's more Olive Gardens than what we may have originally thought. We can handle the cannibalization a lot better today than we could before. And therefore we want to push a little bit harder on Olive Garden and we think, and the returns are just fantastic in that business. So that's the best place to put our capital. We don't plan to \u2013 I'll start backwards on this. We don't think there's going to have a \u2013 be a big compression issue. The amount of people this impacts is small. We're not going to give the exact number. And again, as I talked about earlier, it's included in our guidance for the quarter and we included for next year though and what we'll disclose what our wage inflation we're projected to be when we give you 2022 guidance. And it's for all employees. It's basically, if you're a tipped employee, in your tips and your wage doesn't get you to $10, we'll bring you to $10 an hour. We have \u2013 I haven't seen the number for last week. But the week before, we were at a home about 115,000 versus 165,000 active pre-COVID. And that number is increasing every week. And I think our greatest challenge right now is staffing. It's staffing, trying to attract people to come to work. That's why we're strengthening our employment proposition, which is already strong. We've got to staff it. We've got to train people. We'll train people now in a very high volume environment. And so, as I really think about what we're focused on is really Back-to-Basics restaurant operations. And part of that \u2013 one of those things that we focus on there is hiring great people and having great certified trainers that are able to train those people, to bring our brands to life. And so that's our number one, that's really a number one priority right now. Yes, I'll just comment on fine dining. Obviously, that's coming back a little bit slower. I would say that fine dining in Suburbia is performing much better than fine dining in the central business districts. We are incredibly impressed with the weekend business in fine dining, even in the central business district. So this business is coming back, it's coming \u2013 we're going to be extremely profitable in this business. But this is going to definitely come back slower than casual. And so there's \u2013 I will just add that we've been pretty impressed the last couple of weeks, how this business has rebounded. Yes, first of all, on capacity, I think the last printed thing I saw from Technomic was still 5% to 15% tilted toward the higher end. It's my belief that the restaurants in central business districts will get recapitalized a lot \u2013 and be able to come back a lot quicker than what we'll see in Suburbia. And so, I think that there's population is still growing. And just the fact that a lot of new restaurants are going to \u2013 aren't going to be added are also a benefit as we go forward. So I think as far as the capacity part of it, it's still a real good tailwind for the industry. As far as \u2013 what was the number one.... I think that would \u2013 as you think about that, we're not ready to put a number out there right now. We want to \u2013 the way we think about development is we find the best piece of property that we can find. And then we try to put, what do we think is the best you what \u2013 which restaurant in our brand and our portfolio will maximize the opportunity of that piece of land. And so I think numbers will ebb and flow. But we believe in the next few out years, we're going to get closer to 3% of our framework. That's where we want to be. Well, I'm not sure what the next big idea is. I think the big thing that we're really cognizant of is how do we fight the gravity to pull us back \u2013 pulling us back towards, what had worked extremely well for us and staying, keeping our eye on the prize of all the gains that we made over the last few year. So I think right now, more importantly than ever, the way I'm thinking about it is Back-to-Basics. We've got to run great restaurants. We've got to be able to execute our food, our service and great atmosphere is if we can do that. I think I always say this simple term. How do we do less better? And I think right now we put our businesses through significant change and I'm in this do less better framework. I want to make sure that we're running great, great restaurants. Strategically, I think the way we're \u2013 we continue to think about it is how do we ensure we get, take this opportunity to get our top line growth to 3%, which is a number we haven't really achieved yet. And 3% doesn't sound like a lot, but that's a lot of new restaurants in our system, absolute numbers, right. When you start adding 50 to 70 restaurants a year that puts a lot of strain on your organization and puts a lot of strain on your human resources. So I like this whole notion of getting narrower, not a lot of strategic change, but let's get into execute, execute, execute. I believe our brands are differentiated enough right now to compete effectively. And it's not a lot of work to be done there. Andy, I think it's a little premature to signal what we think that is. I think I would, based on what \u2013 if we start now, I would look at what our norms have been. But one of the things that, we've got to \u2013 we'll have to consider is in this dynamic environment, is what do we think inflation is going to be? And it's too early for us to really understand what we think inflation is going to be in our fiscal 2022. So I would just look \u2013 if you're looking for guidance on that, I would look more towards our historical norms at this point. Yes. Good morning, Howard. I think that's why I'm trying to narrow the focus of the organization and then really focusing on the Back-to-Basics and trying to eliminate any distraction at all. And I believe that, the priorities right now, especially over the next six to nine months is staffing. How do you ensure your supply chain is growing with the demand and all those other basic things that, that go on every day. And part of why we're making this investment today in our people is to say, thank you, and also to be \u2013 to recruit. We know the people best that the teams with the best people will win in this environment. And we need to attract great people, offer them great opportunities, provide careers for them. But you've identified what our operation \u2013 operating priorities are. Rick in the presence and really need to focus on this. We're monitoring the number of employees in each restaurant every single week. We're monitoring today, the number of servers in each restaurant every day. So we understand, what our staffing levels are and what we need to do to support that. Doug Milanes, our Head of Supply Chain has done an incredible job keeping the supply chain full and keeping that continuity. We also have a lot of sensitive products that we serve. They have to be aged appropriately, which they've done a great job on. And so, we're focused on \u2013 you highlighted our biggest challenge. It's not strategic today, it's operational. Well, I think, we're going to do both. We're going to try to bring back anybody that's familiar with the organization. But right now I think most of who we're bringing back, well, maybe the exception of California is new people. And so what we do in that circumstance? We've really, we have a certified trainer program that we were able to really energize and connect with these people that are actually doing the training of the new employees in every one of our brands. And they're the key. We've got to give them the tools and the time and the compensation in order to be able to train these new people effectively. And you're pressing on some of the biggest operational challenges as we've ramped this back up. And I think it's right to highlight that. And we're \u2013 I think we're going to \u2013 our teams are going to be up for the task. As far as, I mean, and I talked a little bit about this earlier Brian, is we just have no definitive plans right now. And on what we're going to put back in or how we're going to put back in and which channel we're going to put back in advertising. We've got to look at the competitive environment. We've got to see where we're at. I think each brand will come back differently and use different channels that are more effective for them. We're still spending a good amount of money in Olive Garden on advertising today. We bought a lot of television in the upfront. We think that's an effective medium for us. And so we'll continue to spend that. I'm very happy with the creative. And so, this is what I would call a game time decision. We will \u2013 when it's right to call that play, we'll call that play. But right now we have no definitive plans to do that."

            "name": "Raj Vennam",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. For the third quarter, total sales for $1.73 billion, a decrease of 26.1%. Same restaurant sales decreased 26.7%. EBITDA was $236 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.98. Turning to this quarter of P&L; food and beverage expenses were 80 basis points higher than last year primarily driven by investments in food quality and mix. Restaurant labor was 20 basis points higher. As Gene mentioned, we invested approximately $17 million in team member bonuses this quarter. Excluding the team member bonuses, restaurant labor would have been 80 basis points favorable to last year. The favorability to last year was driven by hourly labor improvement of 280 basis points due to efficiencies gained from operational simplifications Rick discussed. The hourly labor improvement was partially offset by de-leveraging management labor due to sales declines. Restaurant expense for operating week was 16% lower than last year driven by lower workers' compensation, utilities, repairs and maintenance expense. Restaurant expenses as a percent of sales was 250 basis points higher than last year due to sales de-leverage. Marketing spend was $52 million lower than last year with total marketing 200 basis points favorable to last year. This all does altered in restaurant level EBITDA margin of 18.4%, only 150 basis points below last year. Excluding the one-time hourly team member bonus, restaurant level EBITDA margin would have been even stronger at 19.4%. We impaired one Yard House restaurant this quarter resulting in a non-cash impairment charge of $3 million. This location was in Portland, Oregon and had been temporarily closed since April. Turning to G&A; we finalized the legal recovery during the quarter resulting in favorable of $16 million. This favorability was partially offset by $8.8 million of mark-to-market expense on our different compensation. Excluding these two items, G&A would have been $86 million this quarter. As a reminder, the mark-to-market expense is related to significant appreciation in both the Darden share price and equity market this quarter, and due to the way we hedge this expense it is mostly offset on an after tax basis. Page 13 of this quarter's presentation illustrates the $8.8 million reduction of operating income and corresponding operating income margin reduction of 50 basis points from mark-to-market expense. Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $7.2 million resulting in a net reduction to earnings after tax this quarter of $1.6 million. Our effective tax rate of 2.3% this quarter was unusually low due to two factors: first, the tax benefit from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned reduces the tax rate by 5 percentage points. Second, the stock option exercises this quarter drove approximately $7 million of excess tax benefit. Reducing the tax rate by 4.8 percentage points, after adjusting for these factors our normalized effective tax rate for the third quarter would have been 12.1%. Looking at our segment performance this quarter, Olive Garden saw segment profit margin increase versus last year despite sales declines. Our continued focus on simplified operations, which significantly reduced direct labor combined with lower marketing expenses, drove this margin improvement. Segment profit margin declined for Longhorn as higher than average beef inflation and other investments drove higher food and beverage expense. In addition, both labor and restaurant expenses were higher as a percent of sales due to sales de-leverage. Segment profit margin declined for fine dining and other segments due to de-leverage across the P&L from the significant sales decline year-over-year. We generated over $240 million of free cash flow this quarter ending the third quarter with our $990 million in cash. Our recent performance has given us better visibility into the durability of our cash flows. Therefore, we will return to our 50% to 60% dividend payout target applied to future earnings to determine our dividend. To that end, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share matching our pre-COVID dividend level. The ability to resume pre-COVID dividend levels just 12 months after suspending is a testament to the strength of our business model and the durability of our cash flows. And finally, today we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $500 million, which replaces all previous authorizations Turning to the fourth quarter; as of today, we have 99% of our dining rooms open with some capacity. This morning, we provided sales plans for the first three weeks of the quarter, in which we saw a week-to-week sales improvements. As the vaccine roller progressed, dining room capacity increased, and consumers began receiving stimulus checks. Taking that all into consideration we currently expect for the fourth quarter total sales of approximately $2.1 billion; EBITDA between $345 million and $360 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $1.60 and $1.70 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares. We've also updated our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be between $285 million and $295 million, and we anticipate opening 33 net new restaurants for the year. We continue to believe we can achieve pre-COVID EBITDA dollars on 90% of pre-COVID sales resulting in 150 basis points of EBITDA margin growth, and our Q4 outlook falls within this framework. As we move beyond the fourth quarter, there are additional costs such as training, travel, growth costs, incremental marketing and other investment that we expect will need to come back into the P&L. And while it's too early to provide insights into fiscal 2022 sales and earnings, we did want to provide some preliminary guidance on a few items. We expect total capital spending between $350 million and $400 million and open approximately 35 new desiccant sent in fiscal 2022. We also anticipate an effective tax rate in the range of 12% to 13% for fiscal 2022. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Hi Eric, this is Raj. Thanks for the question. So when you think about the margin I think it depends on really where the sales levels are. And as I mentioned in the pre prepared remarks, there are some costs that have to come back into the P&L and that will come back, but it's not like we're going to ramp up those costs as fast as the sales are coming back here, right? So as you look at Q4; one, I want to point out Q4 generally is our highest or one of his higher, an EBITDA margin then the annual average combine that with the fact that we have this decent acceleration in sales from Q3 to Q4, and some of these costs we're talking about will come back over time as we go beyond Q4. And when you think about at the 90 plus percent sales levels, if you, not saying that he's the discrete cutoff, but if you think about it, that level it's really marketing and labor are two big contributors positively as a percent of sales. And then the offs \u2013 partially offset by food costs going up. That's where we have made some investments. We've all along made investments into the value proposition for the guests. And that we'll continue to do that too. So we feel like at those levels, marketing and labor will help food will take away from it. Personal expenses are probably going to be relatively flat, maybe a slightly off by 10 basis points. And then G&A, we should be flat at 90% given the reduction we've done on the G&A. As we grow from there we do think some of those sales will come \u2013 some of those costs will come back in. And I think we're still not saying the margins are going to go down any further, but we do want to maintain the 150 and see what we can do, but some of these things are going to play out based on the environment and the economic backdrop. No. David, I think we were actually expecting to maintain that margin, so we don't need higher volume to get to that. And then as volume grows, we're saying, we're committed to maintaining that as costs come back in, but we don't think we're going to be diluting margin that 150 basis points is sticky. Yes, I think that's a great question David. I think the way we're thinking about it is as sales grow, we'll find opportunities to make more investments into guest experience, into food quality. Thinks that we want to do, and we also have talked about trying to price \u2013 continuing to price below inflation and below competition. That's one of our bigger investments that we make. Could you see for a time period where our margins exceed and build off of that? Absolutely. But I think longer term; I think the way we're thinking about it is we don't want it to grow too much. We want to just kind of find ways to set us up for longer-term market share gains, but still have a pretty robust business model. Yes, I think it would be tough for me to sit here and project out five years from now what we think the number could be. But all I'll say is we are definitely committed to getting to this 150. And then beyond that, we still go back to our long-term framework once the \u2013 once we get back to the sales levels we had before, it's about that 10 to 30 basis points margin improvement every year. And we think we can still do that. All right. Just let me answer the CapEx one. I'll hand it over to Rick on the technology stuff. So from a CapEx perspective, when you think about our annual CapEx, we're already spending money for next year's new units, right. So that's why you don't really see CapEx move much, because we're still working on our pipeline, we're still working on next year. The other thing I want to remind you is this year spend is relatively low because some of these units were already built earlier. We spent a lot of CapEx last year, and then we were sitting on these restaurants because when the pandemic hit. So that's the color on CapEx. And then Rick? I'd say at this point, think up somewhere around $90 million as a good run rate to start with. And then if that changes, we'll let you know in June. But I think at that point somewhere around $90 million is a good number. And Brian, just for Q4 ballpark, I would expect similar levels as Q3, somewhere around $25 million. Yes. We're not ready to get into fiscal 2022 yet, but I will tell you in fiscal \u2013 for Q4, we do expect our commodity inflation to be a little bit higher at around 2% for the entire basket with, I think there's a little bit more in chicken, and there's a little bit more in \u2013 actually oil is one where we think it's going to be pretty high. There are multitude of factors that are impacting oil, as you might already be aware, but those are the ones I can call out."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone. As Gene said, it's hard to believe we've been operating in this environment for a year. In addition to executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy, our restaurant teams have continued to successfully manage this \u2013 through this situation by remaining focused on the four key priorities we established at the onset of the pandemic: One, ensuring the health and safety of our team members and guests. Two, simplifying operations and strengthening execution. Three, deploying technology to improve the guest experience. And four, transforming our business model. The health and safety of our team members and guests remains our top priority. Throughout the past year, our team members have done a fantastic job of upholding our safety protocols while taking great care of our guests. Today, even as restrictions are easing in some parts of the country, we continue to follow our enhanced safety measures. This includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring masks for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols. Our second priority has been to continue finding ways to simplify our operations and drive in-restaurant execution at each of our brands. This environment gave us a once in a lifetime opportunity to evaluate every aspect of how we operate and make decisions we would not have been able to do in a normal operating environment. A good example of this work, all of our brands have done to streamline menus and remove low preference or low satisfaction items. This focus makes it easier for our restaurant teams to consistently execute our highest preference items, which means we are serving our most popular dishes to more guests. In fact, a year ago, the top 10 entrees at Olive Garden accounted for about 48% of guest preference. And today they account for approximately 55%. Reducing the bottom selling items eliminates distractions and allows us to execute at a high level. We have dramatically reduced low volume items, which reduces the need to prepare them saving time and reducing food waste. For example, at LongHorn Steakhouse, the number of total items with less than 1% preference is down to eight from more than 25, pre-COVID. Third, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience and build on the progress we have made over the last 12 months. When the pandemic began and our dining rooms were closed, we were able to quickly roll out online ordering at our brands that had yet to deploy it. We also streamlined the curbside to go pick up process by rolling out the Curbside I'm Here text message notification feature. So guests can easily alert us when they arrive. These technology enhancements and other process improvements helped Olive Garden achieve new all time high guest satisfaction ratings for delivering on-time and accurate off-premise experiences during a quarter that included three busy off premise days, Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and Valentine's Day. In fact, Valentine's Day was our highest sales day since the start of the pandemic. Also during the quarter, several brands including Olive Garden and LongHorn implemented enhancements to their websites to streamline the online checkout process. This resulted in a meaningful reduction in order abandonment rates. Our continuous digital transformation is resonating with our guests. In fact, during the quarter, nearly 19% of total sales were digital transactions. Further 50% of all guests checks were settled digitally, either online or on our tabletop tablets or via MobilePay. We have made great strides in our digital journey over the past year, and we will continue to strengthen our digital platform and provide our brands with the tools to compete more effectively. And finally, the investments we've made to simplify our business through menu and process simplification have resulted in significant transformation of our business model. For example, across Darden, our hourly labor productivity has improved by over 20% with some brands improving by well over 30% such as Cheddar's. We thought it would be helpful to provide a bit more insight into what the business model transformation has done to Cheddar's P&L, year-to-date through the third quarter Cheddar's has grown the restaurant level margins by over 300 basis points and a year-to-date sales retention of 75%. When Cheddar's reaches 100% of the pre-COVID sales, we expect that restaurant level margins to be well in the high teens, while we don't intend to continue to provide this level of detail in the future this illustration helps to highlight the business model improvements our brands are making. As we have mentioned previously, the simplifications across all of our businesses are expected to result in 150 basis points of margin improvement with 90% of pre-COVID sales. Our business model transformation also strengthens our belief in our ability to open value creating new restaurants across all of our brands. Due to this transformation, the sales required to exceed our return expectations are much lower today. In fact, we opened six new restaurants during the quarter, and each is exceeding our expectations. Before I hand it over to Raj, I want to conclude by saying thank you to our team members. As Gene said, our success is a direct result of their hard work. Being of service is at the heart of our business and our team members demonstrate that every day through their commitment to our guests and each. Raj? Hey, Jeff, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. In regards to those sales and who's driving it, you know, at the start of the pandemic we saw a lot of new customers. A lot of new ones coming in and then hadn't been to our restaurants before and the frequency with which they reordered was pretty high. We're still seeing those new customers but everybody is ordering to go, right? If you came into the dining room and the dining room is full, you may just walk over to the go station in order. But the frequency of our newer customers was higher and is higher than the frequency of our existing customers. We are really happy with what we've done as Gene mentioned with the technology that we put in to go business. It is helping to get some younger people in our restaurants or to order to go what we've done with car side to go and curbside here has made it so much easier for people to come pick up. And so we feel really good about the customers we're getting and the information we're gleaning from them. Hey James, this is Rick. On the curbside experience, all of our brands are offering curbside. Now there might be a few restaurants here and there that might be within in malls, et cetera, that it's hard to do, but all of our restaurants offer curbside today. They all have the curbside, I'm here feature where you can text \u2013 well you'll get a text 10 minutes before their pick-up time to tell the restaurant that they're here. And so they all have that. Once we implement a technology that works, we blow it out in all the restaurants. As regards to kind of the building design and change, we are looking at some changes to prototypes as we build new restaurants, to make it a little bit more convenient for our team to bring the food out to the cars. But there is still a high percentage of people that are picking up in the restaurant that maybe ordering the restaurant and pick-up, or they just want to walk in and maybe sit at the bar for a minute to watch TV. And while they're to go is being prepared. So we have to keep an in-restaurant type of experience for them as well. So we're looking at that. In regards to making a bunch of modifications to our existing restaurants, we're thinking about that as we see our restaurants start to build back-up in the dining room. We're just trying to figure out the most efficient way to make changes, whether it's in the kitchen to give them more, more room for packaging, but maybe not having a side door, because we do believe that the guests may still want to come in. So we're working through that. We don't expect to make huge, huge investments in our restaurant \u2013 existing restaurants where to go. We do have some investments to make, but they're not that great. Thanks, Raj. On the technology front, we are in the process of doing another three-year roadmap for technology. We're going to continue to invest in technology to reduce friction in the guest experience and reduce friction and the team member experience. We've given you some examples of what we've already done this year with shifting everything to curbside, going to Curbside I'm Here. We're actually going to make that process even easier as we keep going forward. We're going to make the process of checking into your \u2013 to the restaurant easier. We're doing a lot of things going forward. Without getting into too much detail, we expect to spend more money in technology than we have this year, and we continue to invest in technology. We think it's an advantage for us. It gives us better access to data, and because of our scale, we can do it. Nicole. This is Rick. I'll start with the guest satisfaction metrics. All our brands are improving their guest satisfaction year-over-year from pre-COVID, even with especially because of all of the things that we've done to simplify our business to make it easier for our restaurants to get the product to what they \u2013 get the product to the consumer in the way they want it. We're shifting more of our sales to our top 10 items, which are high satisfaction items. We've improved significantly to go experience, which at the beginning was a pretty low satisfying experience. It's getting better every week. So on the guest side, all the satisfaction measures look great. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks on to go, Olive Garden was at an all time high for on-time and accurate premise experience for the third quarter, even though it was a really high off-premise quarter for them with three big holidays. In the employee metrics, the metric that we look at the most is turnover and our turnover has been great over the last year. And as Gene mentioned, we just introduced another thing to help the employee experience and their process of coming to work for us. We're going to simplify the hiring process as we go forward, but we have just great, a great employment proposition, which leads to our turnover. Those are the two metrics we look at the most. The last thing I'll say, is there some external metrics that we're really proud of for LongHorn? They're now number one in food quality and food taste with all of the investments they made over the last few years. And that's a pretty high bar for us. And we feel really good about the investments they've made and that's what's driving our performance. Yes. Nicole thanks for that. If we look at the six restaurants that we opened in the quarter, and actually restaurants will open this year, their sales levels have been higher than we thought considering we opened some of these restaurants at really hard, 50% capacity limitations. Now that could be because other restaurants didn't open, but we've been performing really well. If you look at our guest satisfaction measures in those restaurants, we've done a really good job in training our people and getting open. And then the other thing, though, I think a bigger part of our performance is actually at the bottom line of the P&L. And these restaurants are performing much better on their P&L than restaurants that we opened a year or two before. And that's because of the simplifications that we have made. Whenever you simplify you really to make it easy for new restaurants, right. When they open, if they open with a full menu and a pretty big dining room, it's hard for them. When they opened with a menu that we have today with a dining room that's a little bit constrained. It makes it easier, but we've also changed some of our training programs, especially in the fine dining brands to make it almost like you're coming into a restaurant that's always been there. And so we've done a really good job in improving the process to open new restaurants. So I would give it \u2013 I would give that much more of the benefit than another restaurant or two that not didn't open during that time."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of those measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2021 third quarter earnings on March 25 before the market opens followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights. Rick will then provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for the third quarter. And then Gene will share some closing comments. Now, I will turn the call over to Gene.\nGene Lee: Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. As we continue to operate in a very fluid environment and I was pleased with our ability to once again deliver strong profitability in an unpredictable sales environment. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%, same-restaurant sales decreased 20.6% and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74. The last 2 weeks of the quarter negatively impacted our same-restaurant sales by approximately 200 basis points as we quickly went from 97% of our dining rooms being opened in the middle of the quarter to only 80% being open at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, Thanksgiving shifted back into our second quarter this year and we believe just modified their behavior in advance of the holiday. During the quarter, we remain focused on four key priorities. The health and safety of our team members and guests, in restaurant execution in the complex operating environment, deploying technology to improve the guest experience and transforming our business model. The health and safety of our team members and guest has always been our top priority. We continue to follow latest guidance from the CDC as well as our own enhanced safety protocols to create a safe environment for everyone. This includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring mask for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols. I\u2019m proud of the commitment our teams make every day to keep our guests and each other safe. Second, our restaurant teams remain focused on our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy to drive restaurant level execution that results in great guest experiences whether our guests are dining with us or ordering curbside to-go. Our teams have been operating in this environment for 10 months, and they have become very adept at adjusting to the ever-changing COVID restrictions, but it\u2019s still not easy. That\u2019s why we remain committed to our simplified operations, including streamline menus, processes and procedures which continue to strengthen our execution and our guest satisfaction metrics confirm that our restaurant teams are doing a great job delivering exceptional guest experience in this challenging environment. Third, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience. Our brands benefit from the technology platform Darden provides, allowing each of them to compete more effectively by harnessing the power of our digital tools, including the 25 million email addresses in our marketing database. During the quarter, Olive Garden LongHorn Steakhouse launched refresh websites and all our brands continue to use their digital storefronts effectively. More than 55% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital transactions where guest ordered and paid online. And at Olive Garden, 20% of our total sales for the quarter were digital. During the quarter, we also rolled out Curbside I am Here which allows our guests to easily notify the restaurant that they\u2019ve arrived to pick up their curbside to-go order by simply tapping on a link embedded in a text message. As a result, our operators are spending less time on the phone and more time focused on ensuring orders are accurate and on-time, which is leading to improved guest satisfaction scores. We also introduced Wait List Visibility, allowing guest to see their place on the waiting list using their phone regardless of whether they have checked in online or in person. And we\u2019re working on several other initiatives, including streamlining our online checkout process and adding additional mobile payment options to provide even more convenience for our guest. We continue to accelerate our digital journey, and I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we are making. Finally, we continue to view this environment as a rare opportunity to transform our business model for long-term growth. We continue to make investments in our team members, product quality and portion sizes to ensure we emerge even stronger and better positioned to grow share. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales declined 19.9% as capacity restrictions continue to limit their top-line sales. Olive Garden began November with 56 dining rooms closed, and that number accelerated to 208 by the end of the month. However, they were able to deliver strong average weekly sales during the quarter of more than 73,000 per restaurant, retaining 80% of last year\u2019s sales. Olive Garden also continued to realize operational efficiencies and strengthened margin as a result of their simplified menu and the elimination of promotional activity, including discounts. In the current limited capacity environment, their reduced marketing spend was focused on showcasing the convenience of their off-premise experience, while featuring compelling core menu items rather than limited time promotions. This led to increased segment profit margin, while making additional investments in abundance and value. Additionally, off-premise sales grew 83% in the quarter, representing 39% of total sales. Enabled by the technology investments I mentioned earlier, Olive Garden improved their to-go experience and achieved another all-time high in guest satisfaction for having orders ready to pick up at the time promised. Finally, Olive Garden successfully opened three new restaurants in the quarter. LongHorn Steakhouse had another solid quarter. Same-restaurant sales declined 11.1%. Almost 20% of their restaurants grew same-restaurant sales in the quarter. They also successfully opened three new restaurants during the quarter. The LongHorn team remains laser focused on their strategy of increasing the quality of their guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement. During the quarter, the team did a great job of managing controllable costs while their simplified menu drove improved labor productivity. Finally, LongHorn grew off-premise sales by more than 175%, representing 22% of total sales. Now I will turn it over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. For the second quarter, total sales were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%. Same-restaurant sales declined 20.6%, EBITDA was $206 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74. Our second quarter start was encouraging with weekly sales building on results from the first quarter. However, as COVID-19 cases began increasing in November and many state and local governments re-imposed dining room restrictions, the last two weeks of the quarter trended down significantly. We estimate that this downward shift in sales over the last two weeks negatively impacted operating income by approximately $15 million. Turning to the P&L. Food and beverage expense was 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily driven by investments in food quality and increased to-go packaging. Restaurant labor was 140 basis points lower than last year with hourly labor improving by over 310 basis points, driven by operational simplification. This was partially offset by deleverage and management labor due to sales declines and $3 million of emergency pay net of retention credits as we reinstated our emergency pay program for our team members impacted by dining room closures. Restaurant expense per operating week was 13% lower than last year, driven by lower repairs, maintenance and utilities expenses. However, sales deleverage resulted in restaurant expense as a percent of sales coming in 170 basis points higher than last year. We reduced marketing spend by almost $50 million this quarter with total marketing 210 basis points favorable to last year. Restaurant level EBITDA margin was 17.9%, 140 basis points above last year despite the sales decline of 19%. General and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by $8 million of mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. This is related to significant appreciation in both the Darden share price and equity markets this quarter. As a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, it is mostly offset in the tax line. Page 12 of this quarter\u2019s presentation illustrates the $8.1 million reduction of operating income and corresponding operating income margin reduction of 50 basis points from mark-to-market expense. Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $6.4 million, resulting in a net mark-to-market reduction to earnings after-tax this quarter of $1.7 million. The effective tax rate of 8.3% this quarter was lower by 5.1 percentage points due to the tax benefits from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned. After adjusting for this, the normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter would have been 13.4%. Looking at our segment performance this quarter, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and our other segment, all saw a segment profit margin increase despite sales declines. This was driven by our continued focus on simplified operations, which significantly reduced direct labor and lower marketing expenses. Our Fine Dining segment profit margin of 18.8% was impressive, although below last year, driven by a 30% sales decline. We ended the second quarter with $770 million in cash and another $750 million available in our untapped credit facility, giving us over $1.5 billion of available liquidity. We generated over $150 million of free cash flow in the quarter and improved our adjusted debt to adjusted capital to 58% at the end of the quarter, well within our debt covenant of 75%. The board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per share, 50% of our Q2 diluted EPS within our long-term framework for value creation. We will continue to have regular discussions with the board on our future dividends. As I mentioned earlier, the quarter started with sales building upon first quarter results. As dining room closures increased, these improving sales trends reversed. As of today, we have approximately 77% of our restaurants operating with at least partial dining room capacity versus a peak of 97% in the middle of the second quarter. Moving forward, we may experience further dining room closures and increasing capacity restrictions in the third quarter. As you may recall, in our last earnings call, we mentioned that the third quarter is historically our peak seasonal sales quarter, driven by the Christmas, New Year\u2019s and Valentine\u2019s Day holidays as well as travel time during this time of year. At that time, we also stated that it will be more difficult to increase on-premise average unit volumes if capacity restrictions do not ease. Current dining room closures, capacity restrictions and reductions in travel will exacerbate our same-restaurant sales comparison to last year due to the higher sales \u2013 seasonal sales from last year. Additionally, there are still uncertainties surrounding further capacity limitations and dining room closures and the duration of these impacts. Given all these factors, we are providing a broad range of expectations for the third quarter. We expect total sales to be between 65% and 70% of prior year levels, resulting in total sales of between $1.53 billion and $1.65 billion, EBITDA between $170 million and $210 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $0.50 and $0.75 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares. With dining rooms closures increasing, we are focusing on our playbook of expense management and off-premise sales. While there is encouraging news on the broad distribution of COVID-19 vaccine in the spring, we currently don\u2019t anticipate meaningful sales trend improvements until some time in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Despite the short-term headwinds we faced with sales trends, operational complexity and impacts to our team members, I\u2019m confident we are making the right decisions for the long-term to create a better guest experience and strengthen our business. And consistent with our messaging last quarter, we continue to believe we can achieve 100% of our pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at approximately 90% of pre-COVID sales, while continuing to make appropriate investments in our business. Now with that, I will turn it back to Gene.\nGene Lee: Thanks, Rick. This morning, we also announced that Rick will become our President and Chief Operating Officer. Rick\u2019s career represents what our industry is all about. He joined Darden as a Buster at Red Lobster 1984 and has worked extremely hard mastering many functions. On January 4, he will become the President of the world\u2019s largest full service restaurant company. He\u2019s been a great partner to me over the last five years, and I look forward to working side-by-side with him in his new role. Additionally, we announced that Raj Vennam will become our Chief Financial Officer. Raj began his career at Darden in 2003, and has done an exceptional job in every role he has held. His promotion recognizes the significant contributions he has made to our individual brands as well as the greater organization. With a brilliant mind and a keen understanding of our industry, Raj is the perfect person to take over for Rick. I\u2019m excited to see him expand his role in the company as CFO. Rick and Raj are here with me in the room today, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate both of them. I want to close by recognizing our team members in the restaurants and at the support center. I can\u2019t say enough about the dedication they\u2019ve demonstrated throughout the year. Their focus, commitment and determination is exceptional. With multiple jurisdictions implementing dining room closures, we know many team members will not get the hours they needed during this holiday season. That is why we have reintroduced our emergency pay program that will provide three weeks of emergency pay to team members who are furloughed from their restaurant when dining rooms are closed. Our [indiscernible] greatest competitive advantage and we are committed to taking care of them. On behalf of the management team and the board of directors, I want to thank all our team members for your tireless effort to serve our community by providing the comfort of a warm meal. Thank you for going to the extraordinary lines to take care of our guests and each other. I wish you all a safe and a happy holiday season. And with that, we will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. First, Gene, congratulations on being elected to Chair of the board and Rick and Raj also congratulations on your promotions, very well deserved. Gene, my question is about those changes. I wanted maybe to hear your thoughts on how your day-to-day involvement will change as a result of Rick taking on the President and COO role? And just your thoughts on whether investors should interpret this as a signal that you will be less involved in the business going forward?\nGene Lee: No, absolutely not. I plan on being as involved operationally there, that\u2019s my strength. I mean, I see this as a opportunity to create growth for both Rick and Raj. I think it\u2019s going to give Rick an opportunity to understand operations more deeply. Obviously, he has a great relationship with our presidents today, but I think it\u2019s important for him and his development to get a little deeper into the operations and get to know and oversee a lot of the other people that make things happen, just not the president. I also think it\u2019s important for him to partner with me on making sure that we are leveraging all the non-consumer-facing parts of our business and to see if there is an opportunity to continue to find additional synergies to enable us to further invest in our business. So I see this as an opportunity to work with people that deserve the opportunity to grow. And more importantly, have an extra set of hands to be able to do some things and look at things maybe a little bit differently. Giving Rick the freedom and the time to look across the organization and see where we can pick up some additional synergy I think is a good thing. I think that I tried to do that even in a position that was in, but I know there is a limit to the amount of time you have. I think giving Rick that time will be very beneficial to the organization as we move forward. So I am excited about these changes. It has \u2013 I don\u2019t think anybody should read anything into it. I am going to still be heavily involved in food servicing atmosphere, just the way I am today, and I look at it as a great opportunity. I also look forward to working with Raj and giving him a chance to develop into a world-class Chief Financial Officer, and I think that\u2019s going to be really exciting. So don\u2019t read anything into it other than we\u2019re creating growth for our people, creating new opportunities and we have a few things that we want to get done with this change.\nDavid Tarantino: Sounds great. Congrats again to all of you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Gene, how is the company thinking about returning to a normalized marketing spend, meaning, does the company plan to wait until government restrictions on dining usage are lifted or does the company plan to see what kind of pent-up demand there is going to be as consumer mobility increases to determine how much advertising utilized? I am just trying to get a sense for how you guys are thinking about that?\nGene Lee: Yes. We have no definitive plans to put back marketing at this point in time. Obviously, we have developed multiple options of how to come back and use those resources that we have. But I think \u2013 and part of your question, I think the answer is there is that we\u2019re going to look and see what the competitive environment is like, we want to see what the pent-up demand is like and we\u2019re going to put back the marketing \u2013 put marketing resources back in the business judiciously. And I would love to get to a point where we can grow our business and rely a little less on advertising spend. We really like the P&Ls with the marketing line at the level it\u2019s at right now. And so there is no predetermined outcome on this. We just \u2013 we need to get into the competitive environment and then make our decisions then. We have developed multiple options if needed.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Great. Congratulations on everyone\u2019s promotions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thanks so much. Gene, Rick and Raj, happy holidays and congrats on the well deserved promotions. Gene, do the most recent few weeks of sales trends change your view from last quarter that 5% to 15% of the category is likely to see store closures? And what I\u2019m trying to get at is, are you starting to see more favorable terms from landlords and developers that will benefit the development pipeline as you look out to the 2022 and 2023 class of openings?\nGene Lee: No, I don\u2019t think \u2013 I mean, I think that my position on closure is still in that 5% to 15% range. And it\u2019s unfortunate that a lot of these small businesses are being impacted this way, because I do think it has a \u2013 it will have a negative impact on our \u2013 on the productivity of our industry, so on so forth. So as far as real estate goes, I think that my position on that is still pretty much the same is that there is some more availability out there right now. However, we\u2019re not seeing any weakness in the rent deals. I think what we are \u2013 I think there is some speculation going on out there right now with some of the REITs. So I think as we move forward, we will continue to try to grow our businesses responsibly. We want to eventually get back into our long-term framework. We\u2019ll give you some more guidance in March exactly how we\u2019re thinking about FY \u201822 for development. But we reconfirmed our guidance for this year and hoping that we can get the number of restaurants that we talked about in the press release open. And we have a bunch of restaurants today sitting there ready to go and that are ready to open. We just need to \u2013 our guideline here is, once we get to approximately 50% occupancy in a jurisdiction, we will go ahead and open that restaurant, and we\u2019ve been very successful doing that.\nAndrew Charles: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks and good morning. And I echo the congratulations to all three of you on the upcoming move into your new roles. Gene, in the press release and on this call, you talked a lot about the fact that you were taking this opportunity to transform the business for a long-term growth. And on the call, when you spoke about that in your prepared remarks, you specifically said, employee investments and some menu and portion changes, but can you just talk a little bit more beyond that. What else are you doing to truly transform this company for long-term growth and how do you strategically think about growth, both for the AUV recapture opportunity and the unit and portfolio growth of the company in the long-term?\nGene Lee: Good question, Brian. I think we think about it in three ways, right? What are we doing to ensure that we can grow the base from a same-restaurant sales perspective. And I think a lot of the simplification and efficiency \u2013 and the efficiencies that we\u2019re creating. But more importantly, and I think I talked about this in the last call was, as we brought our menus down, we learned a lot about guest behavior and what the guest wanted to buy without our nudge. And I think that\u2019s really been eye opening for us. And I think that that\u2019s going to strengthen the operation and day-to-day operation on that side. So I really think that we\u2019re well positioned there. We have done a lot of good work to ensure that our brand is set up for success. Secondly, we talked about transformation. And when we go to second bucket of growth, which is new restaurants, the key here is that we believe that the business model from a cost side is much stronger than it was pre-pandemic, which should enable us to be able to grow, especially in Olive Garden, deeper than we may have thought we would be able to grow pre-pandemic. So that\u2019s one of the things I\u2019m really excited about is, we think that we can actually over time tick up Olive Garden growth and handle \u2013 because of the improvements we\u2019ve made, we think we can handle the cannibalization a little bit better and still get a good return on our investment. The third bucket that you highlighted was really around how do we continue to add brands to the platform? And as I\u2019ve said forever, we continue to look at what our options are. The filter that we use really comes down to does the \u2013 does it benefit us to put that brand on the platform? Does the platform benefit that brand? Do we think it can grow faster than Olive Garden to improve our growth rate? And we\u2019ve historically done something every three or four years. This has obviously been a different period of time. But we believe that to be an avenue of our growth and to support our long-term framework. And so I think we\u2019re really well positioned in all of those \u2013 in those three buckets to drive the business. The last thing that I would say is I think that \u2013 in this transformation, it\u2019s moved a lot of the technology forward faster than what we originally were planning to do. And the big change for us is moving from \u2013 moving how we handle the off-premise business, which has been a big part of our growth historically the last 5 years as we capture the convenience trend. But really getting clarity that this is going to be a curbside business, it\u2019s going to be technologically enabled versus someone coming to the restaurant and getting out of the car and coming to pick it up. And I think that we\u2019ve really worked hard and our team has done a great job. And I think that experience today, when you come into an Olive Garden, especially Olive Garden and LongHorn, in all our brands, but really this is an Olive Garden play because of the food travel so well. I think that that\u2019s going to really be a competitive advantage going forward.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks for that, Gene. And nobody seems to be taking their follow-up, but I am going to ask one, if you don\u2019t mind. The step back that\u2019s happening in the business in the third quarter, it\u2019s pretty telegraphed by what\u2019s been happening in the world. But when you look back at the quarter that you just reported, when you got to that 97% of units offering in-store dining in the middle of the quarter, can you give us a peek into how the business was performing with that type of percentage of stores operating in that manner?\nGene Lee: Well, I think there were still geographic problems, and I would say that we were really adhering to the social distancing. But the business \u2013 in some ways I gave you that because I said we \u2013 the last two weeks cost us 200 basis points for the quarter. And so I think there were parts of the country that were performing really well, and I think you can look at the mobility index out there and see what parts of the country were performing well. And so if you look at Georgia and Texas, Florida hasn\u2019t been performing as well just because of tourism is down and we have a lot of restaurants based in tourism. But in our non-tourist markets in Florida we\u2019re performing well. So we had some good momentum, but we all \u2013 we knew as a management team that we weren\u2019t \u2013 this wasn\u2019t done, that we\u2019re going to face this second wave and we are prepared for it. And we had good processes and we\u2019ve been able to wind down the businesses effectively to off-premise-only and then we\u2019ll quickly be able to wind them back up and take advantage of the opportunity.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you and congratulations, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks. And I would also like to add my congrats on the promotions. My question is, as we look ahead to the vaccine rollout, can you talk about what you think you need to do differently in order to maximize the opportunity to capitalize on that pent-up demand that likely exists? And as a follow-up to that, what is the \u2013 what do you think the flow-through rate is on incremental sales today? And what do you think it will be post-vaccine, assuming you don\u2019t need any \u2013 assuming you don\u2019t need to discount or advertise? Thanks.\nGene Lee: I will let our new President answer that.\nRick Cardenas: Well, first of all, thanks everybody for all the kind words. And I want to congratulate Raj as well on his promotion. He has been a real partner to me over these \u2013 over the four and a half, five years that I\u2019ve been the CFO. And so I appreciate that. What do we needed to capitalize. Gene has been talking a lot about what we\u2019re doing to make sure that we invest in our team members, invest in our food. And as the restaurants start to ramp up, we really believe that we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019ve seen growth when those restaurants start to open. We\u2019re not going to talk strategically about what we\u2019re going to do to capitalize on that. But just know that our business model is so much better that even if we \u2013 as we get our sales to grow, our margins will continue to improve, which gets to the second part of that question that you asked, and the question is flow-through in incremental sales. As we look at what we\u2019re doing today, right, today, our variable margins are closer to 50% and before they were closer to 40%. And so we\u2019ve taken a lot of costs out, but some of those costs will come back in. And as we mentioned, and that would imply about 150 basis points of margin improvement over the long run. But right now, incremental profitability is pretty strong. When we started to see some closures, we started to see that drop. And so as we move forward, we still believe that we\u2019re going to get to a 100% of our pre-COVID EBITDA, 90% of pre-COVID sales. We just don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to get to the 90% of pre-COVID sales.\nEric Gonzalez: Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nChris Carril: Hi. Good morning, Gene, Rick and Raj. Congratulations on your new roles and promotions announced this morning. Rick or Raj, could you please provide your thoughts on how to think about G&A now moving forward, both in the near-term and longer term? At this point, how much of the savings that you\u2019ve seen thus far do you think could be held on to in a more normalized environment and how does the increased focus on technology impact this?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Chris. Thanks. The G&A, I\u2019ll talk about this quarter that we just ended. And as you saw, we reported about $90 million in G&A. But that would have been closer to $82 million without that mark-to-market expense. And as you recall, at the end of the first quarter call, we talked about the early retirement program that we had, saving us about $25 million to $30 million a year. We\u2019re still seeing that and we still believe that we\u2019ll keep that as we move forward. But we\u2019ve also had some savings in G&A because of reduced travel and other things, no general manager conference and those kind of things. Those things will come back. How fast they come back is a question. But we\u2019re running about 5% G&A or 5.5% G&A right now, which is remarkable considering our sales where they were \u2013 where they are. As we get back to our pre-COVID sales, we will start seeing G&A come up a little bit, but nowhere near where it was before because of that $25 million to $30 million \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, $25 million to $30 million of savings that we got on early retirement.\nChris Carril: Got it. Thank you. And just again the increased focus on technology is there any potential impact there?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. No, we\u2019ve been investing in technology for years. As we continue to work on our technology investments, that will impact the depreciation line amortization line going forward. But we also have some projects that we worked on [indiscernible] would fall off. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in technology. Will that help make us more efficient here in the support center? Yes. But a lot of our G&A is out in the field and our directors of operations and our senior vice president of operations and technology will help them be more effective and more efficient, but it won\u2019t get us a whole lot of G&A save. But absolutely, the technology investments we\u2019re making are more about in restaurant. So that\u2019s not a G&A, that\u2019s kind of restaurant margin.\nChris Carril: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thank you. Good morning, and congratulations, Gene, Rick and Raj. One question and then a follow-up, the question is in terms of the labor outlook, obviously lots of moving pieces. And I think we\u2019d agree Darden\u2019s an employer of choice. And with unemployment up, inflation in theory should ease and you experienced significant leverage in the second quarter. I\u2019m just wondering how you think about that in the context of potential for national minimum wage increase. I\u2019m just wondering your bigger picture industry thoughts maybe using Florida as a guide or how you think about how you can offset that whether with cost savings or menu pricing or just broad outlook on the labor line going forward? And then I had one follow-up.\nGene Lee: Yes. Good morning, Jeff. Labor is definitely is a little bit of a question mark for us and for the industry. But as we think about labor, we\u2019ve dealt with the structural increases over time very effectively. We are better positioned than anybody else in the industry to be able to deal with that because where our margins are today. Do I \u2013 at the bottom if you\u2019re asking me, do I think there\u2019ll be a federal minimum wage increase that\u2019s similar to Florida, I think over time we will see federal minimum wage increase, but not at the same rate as Florida. I think the key for us and the way we\u2019re thinking about it is, how do we get to the right tip wage and to keep that relationship between the constituents \u2013 two constituents, the guest and the server that don\u2019t want that relationship to change, albeit people in public office and some advocacy groups believe that that relationship should change where our team members in service really don\u2019t want that to change. So how do we protect that, get that to the right level. If we\u2019re all \u2013 if the industry at all faced with it then, we are going to have to figure out how from a pricing standpoint we are able to pass that through. I think long-term, when I look at the P&L and think about it, I think it\u2019s \u2013 California is an example of it today. You\u2019re going to end up with a little bit lower cost of goods sold and a little bit higher labor cost, but you\u2019re going to end up at the same place. And so as long as you are thinking about that way, I\u2019m confident in our ability to manage that over the long-term. Could it have some short-term impacts and volatility of the cost structure? Yes. But long-term, I like where we are positioned and our ability to be able to deal with it.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just the follow-up, you mentioned earlier, Gene, that maybe there is an opportunity to increase penetration of your brands, obviously Olive Garden is the furthest along, so maybe that\u2019s the best example. I\u2019m just wondering whether there is any quantification on that or how you would think as an alternative about maybe using goes kitchens? I mean, with your portfolio being as large as it is, I would think you can create your own kitchen just of your own portfolio since the brand is already pretty well known and not necessarily need to open up as many new boxes. So just trying to get a sense for that? Thank you.\nGene Lee: No, we believe we\u2019re an on-premise restaurant company. And we believe \u2013 we strongly believe that demand for in-restaurant dining is going to come back really strong. There\u2019ll be some fall-off on the off-premise occasion. I think people have a lot of fatigue with that right now. Long-term, convenience is going to \u2013 when you think about long-term, convenience is still going to be important. But I think that \u2013 and off-premise will come back and be strong and be stronger at some point than it was pre-COVID. But I believe that these are \u2013 these brands need to be developed to be on-premise locations that as your primary business that drives an auxiliary business, which is your off-premise location, off-premise business, but you developed the brand in a box and we create in-restaurant \u2013 great in-restaurant experience. And the logistics of moving that the last mile are just so so expensive and something that we know really cuts into the profitability and some that we don\u2019t want to be involved in.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you and congratulations to the team on the promotions. Gene, I wanted to ask if you can give us an update on the Cheddar\u2019s brand and what, if any changes you guys have made throughout the pandemic and how should we think about the unit growth of that concept when we come out of this pandemic?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think we\u2019ve talked about in the last call the biggest transformation we\u2019ve made in the cost structure has been at Cheddar\u2019s. As we simplified the menu, we really were able to get in there and look at all the processes and procedures from the backdoor to the dining room table. And the team has made great progress there, which has resulted in a significant reduction in labor cost. And we\u2019ve got a significant reduction in the waste in that business around cost of goods sold, which has really changed the business model. Prior to the pandemic, we had just rolled out at every single guest which has been received very well, and we were able to absorb the pricing that we implemented. When we did that, our value ratings have actually increased. I think the other thing that going through this crisis has accelerated is their off-premise capabilities. Prior to the pandemic, we did not have a ton of capabilities there. We didn\u2019t \u2013 we really had a couple of phone lines, but it was just a mess. So we\u2019ve increased the number of phone lines. We\u2019ve got online ordering in place. We\u2019ve now got the Curbside I\u2019m Here in there. And it takes our businesses growing fairly rapidly through the pandemic, and we\u2019re very pleased with that. We\u2019ve got to get better at it because it\u2019s not a core competency in Cheddar\u2019s, but I think the team has been working really hard on it and I know they have got a big initiative, and I\u2019m really proud of what they are doing. As far as unit growth goes, we\u2019ve really \u2013 I always talk about human resources than we talk about unit growth. We\u2019ve stabilized the human resources in Cheddar\u2019s. The human resource metrics are getting closer to Darden metrics. I think actually management turnover is actually in the middle now after being such an outlier for so long. So I am excited about that. But we still need to build management strength to handle growth. Now we have been opening restaurants all the way through the transition, through the pandemic and through \u2013 really through the integration. And I would expect unit growth to be somewhere in that 5% to 8% range, which I think we can handle from a human resource standpoint. So it\u2019s additive to our growth rate. We\u2019re excited about the business. We\u2019re excited to see what the P&L will really look like in a post-pandemic environment. And we\u2019ve always loved the business and we love the business today, and we\u2019re excited about it. We\u2019ve got \u2013 team has done a great job, I\u2019m really proud of them.\nPeter Saleh: Do you anticipate having to spend more as a percentage of sales for Cheddar\u2019s to \u2013 on the marketing side to accelerate that growth in the coming quarters or year?\nGene Lee: No, I just don\u2019t have \u2013 we don\u2019t have the density in that business to be cost effective from a marketing standpoint. I think we\u2019ll continue to use the digital \u2013 our digital capabilities there. But really, it was always a high volume concept that didn\u2019t have the cost structure set up right. Now we have the cost structure set up \u2013 we think set up right and doing 5,000 guests a week. I think that the growth in that business really comes from new units not really comp growth. There is not many restaurant companies out there doing 5,000 guests a week.\nPeter Saleh: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much. Happy holidays to everyone and congratulations from me as well. Rick or Raj, maybe two, maybe more boring finance questions, one is just on the third \u2013 on your current quarter guidance. Even at the high end, it would assume revenues might be a little lower than they are, total revenues this quarter, but the operating margins might be actually higher, I should say, EBITDA margins. Is that just a function of like the G&A, which was a little bit off this quarter because of mark-to-market? Is there something else going on that would actually allow you even have higher profitability versus second quarter on lower sales?\nRick Cardenas: Hi, John. No, I think you got it a little bit on the G&A front. But as we continue to reopen restaurants, we are getting more efficient at that, right? So if restaurants come back and reopen, we are just getting better at doing that. And as restaurants close, we are getting more \u2013 we are more efficient doing that as well. So we just believe that we have got a business model that\u2019s wired pretty well right now and that should show up in our margins in Q3.\nJohn Glass: And in the next \u2013 this is probably the last quarter we\u2019ll be talking about negative same-store sales and then you\u2019ll start to lap the May period etc. How should investors sort of think about how to model the business or think about the recovery? Should we just focus on average unit volumes and then just sort of back into this implied same-store sales because that\u2019s what really drives things to be really \u2013 year-over-year doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s really just the volume capacities are limited to a point until those capacity restrictions end. Is that the best way to think much of business over the next couple of quarters after you start lapping the pandemic?\nGene Lee: Yes. John, I think what investors have to do is make assumptions for when the pandemic starts to ease and when dining room restrictions kind of \u2013 when dining rooms reopen and then look at our average unit volumes what we\u2019re doing today and kind of put some kind of a factor on that. And you can kind of see some of the things that we\u2019ve shown in our releases and pretty transparent on our weekly sales and restaurants that have dining rooms opened versus the total company and just kind of make your best guesses on when do you think the pandemic is going to wane and when dining rooms are going to reopen. We can\u2019t tell you when that is, but we feel really confident that when that does happen, we\u2019re going to be there to capitalize on it.\nJohn Glass: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nDennis Geiger: Thank you and congrats to all on well deserved promotions. Gene, wondering if you could talk a bit more about technology and the digital platforms, you talked a bunch about the initiatives that recently rolled out and those that are coming. But can you size up the opportunity a bit more on the role that tech plays and digital plays and can play for the brand, perhaps a bit more maybe on some of the top line benefits and thinking about guest satisfaction, speed ultimately and sales? And then, Rick, I think you talked some about the benefits from the cost and margin perspective a little bit, but if there is anything more to kind of frame up that opportunity as well? Thank you.\nGene Lee: I think \u2013 first of all, I think technology really helps you on the off-premise side. As we talk to our guest, they continue to talk \u2013 tell us they don\u2019t want a technologically advanced or enabled in-restaurant experience. They don\u2019t want to look at digital menus. I mean, as we put the QR codes out there and have people try to look at the menus on their phone, they really pushed back, they don\u2019t like that. And so that trend I don\u2019t think is going to take place in restaurant. We are playing with some handheld devices to see if we can get orders quicker. I think that kiosk has played a major role in a lot of our brands. It\u2019s enabled our servers to in a non-pandemic time be able to use that device to get orders in. It really does a great job on payment. The option rate on payment is extremely high with that device as the consumer becomes used to using it. So in restaurant, I don\u2019t see a ton of technological advances there over time. I think the things that we are working on, you know Wait List is important. Again, the big one that we\u2019re working on right now is how do you accelerate the checkout process on an online order and how can that be as friendly as the big retailers. And so those types of things on the margin I think technology is there. We are fairly technologically advanced with our dining room system, our KDS system. I\u2019m not sure how much more is there that we see right now. We are working on a technology roadmap over the next five years to figure out where do we want to invest and how do we get the highest return on that. And so there is still work to be done. I think the majority of it still is in off-premise to accelerate that. And then on the other side, we don\u2019t talk much about, but when you think about the size of our email database today and how we interact with our guests digitally. We will continue to evolve that and get better at that and more efficient with that. Trying to figure how to communicate more effectively with our consumers and let them know about the things that might drive a visit. And so I\u2019m excited about that. There is a lot of engagement digitally with our brand, both from an email database, but from social. Just think about what happened last week when Taylor Swift dropped the song with Olive Garden in it, and how we were able to capture that socially and create buzz around that. And all of a sudden, when Taylor Swift drops our name in a song, our brand becomes very, very relevant. It\u2019s a 40-plus year old brand that\u2019s all of a sudden relevant with her audience. And our team was working around the clock to capitalize on that activity. And to those that are listening that were on that team, they did a fantastic job to be able to make that relevant. So, thank you to them and thank you to Taylor Swift for dropping Olive Garden in her song.\nDennis Geiger: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJeff Farmer: Great. Thank you, and congratulations to all three of you. Well deserved across the board. Another labor question for you. So if memory serves, you saw 350 basis points of hourly labor favorability in the fiscal first quarter. It sounds like you guys just talked about 310 basis points in the second quarter. How should we be thinking about favorability moving forward, especially with the emergency pay coming back?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Jeff. This is Rick. On the labor front, the hourly labor of 310 basis points favorability this quarter, it was really driven by the fact \u2013 compared to 350 in Q1, it was really driven by the fact that in Q1 we had a much, much more simplified menu in some of these restaurants because some of them were still to go only, some of those restaurants were running with very few hourly employees. And so, as we started ramping up dining rooms, yes, we added some labor, but 40 basis point difference isn\u2019t very big when you consider the sales that we added from Q1 to Q2. And the emergency pay isn\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t necessarily put that into our direct labor cost, it\u2019s more in the kind of fixed labor, we talk about it. So when we talk about the 310 basis point to the 350 basis points, it does not include emergency pay.\nJeff Farmer: Okay. And just as a follow-up again on labor, this is a popular investor question. But you touched on it, but with indoor dining suspensions affecting roughly 25% of the system as you \u2013 most recently. Can you provide some color on the impact that that has on variable restaurant level costs, specifically in the labor and restaurant expense lines? And I know you\u2019ve shared some color on hourly versus management labor as a percent of total labor, but anything there to sort of help analysts and investors understand the movement between fixed and variable costs for restaurants that are essentially close to indoor dining?\nGene Lee: Yes. When you think about, when you have no indoor dining, a big part of our restaurant is the servers and \u2013 so that\u2019s a little bit less, actually, a little less efficient in number of hours than in our premise business. On dollars it\u2019s not so bad, but on an hour\u2019s basis you have a lot more servers per guests then you do wanted to go \u2013 to go experience. So actually it does help us a little bit when we go to off premise only, just for a little bit of time. We actually don\u2019t like to be off premise only, we would much rather have the total sales and the total margin of being open on premise. And in relation to the fixed versus variable, that \u2013 as the definition says, the variable cost definitely go way down as we \u2013 our sales go down. Most of our costs on the fixed side will be there. We have a few things that we can turn off, when we go to off-premise only. The TVs, the music and those kind of things, but that\u2019s not significant. The other thing that is significant as we have a little less repair and maintenance. When you\u2019re restaurant isn\u2019t getting beat up in the dining room, you don\u2019t have to do as much repairs there. But I would say, we would much rather have a full restaurant full dining rooms and deal with the cost of that, then have empty dining rooms and just do off-premise.\nJeff Farmer: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nLauren Silberman: Thanks for the questions. Congrats to all. Hopefully at this time next year all restaurant will be open at full capacity. When you reopen restaurant, how long does it take for restaurants to ramp up sales to their full allowable capacity? Is that immediate or it takes several weeks to build. What I\u2019m trying to get at is, how quickly do you expect to reach full pre-COVID sales level, assuming capacity restrictions are lifted 100%?\nGene Lee: Well, I think that \u2013 I mean that\u2019s hard for us to really define for you. I think that from our standpoint, we can \u2013 other than maybe having a ramp up in staffing, we can get right \u2013 we can get to a point where we can move back to 100% fairly quickly of where we were from a volume standpoint. And I think even staffing would be more of a fatigue thing, because we probably have to work our people more hours than what they were used to in the near-term, but I think we can get there right away. The question is going to be more on the consumer demand is that, is this going to come back in all at once or is it going to come back over a period of time as more and more people get comfortable. You think about the different demographics out there today, and is it going \u2013 our people is going to, as soon as they are vaccinated say, Okay, I can get out and move or are they still going to be cautious. And that to us is the unknown. But what I would tell everybody on the call and our investors is that, we\u2019re going to be prepared to be able to handle the situation as it unfolds. And we\u2019re going to be in a situation where I think that our brands are trusted and beloved by our guest and that people once they feel good about being able to have a little bit more mobility, they\u2019re going to come back to as quickly and we\u2019re going to be ready to serve them a great meal and deliver on our expectation.\nLauren Silberman: Great. And then can you touch on those kitchen that are sending us the virtual brands operating out of existing restaurants, more restaurants are developing new virtual concept businesses. And at near-term sales, I think, uncertainty regarding the same tower over the long term. Last quarter you said this wasn\u2019t the right approach for Darden, is that still your view? And can you just expand on your view on the concept of virtual brands and whether that\u2019s appropriate for any of those concepts in the Darden portfolio?\nGene Lee: It\u2019s still our position, we believe that we need to stay focused on running the brands that we spent many, many years investing and marketing and building. And I believe that that\u2019s the right place to be. I believe, as I said last quarter, others have got to do what they think they need to do to run their business. I think the question I would ask is, who owns a virtual brand? Is the kitchen or just door dash on the virtual brand?\nLauren Silberman: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJon Tower: Awesome. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the questions. Congrats to the team, happy Friday and happy holidays to everybody. Just two follow-ups really. First one, when thinking about the targeted 100 to 150 basis point margin improvement over time, does that take into account potentially a higher or a lower level of marketing spend over time? Or essentially we\u2019re turning back to, say, the 3% spend? And then digging a bit deeper into the unit potential we were discussing a little bit earlier. When thinking about it, are you contemplating the idea of potentially putting more units in an existing trade area or do you think that there is greater opportunity for your brands to move into a smaller markets over time? And is this more about the portfolio or all of Olive Garden specific? And then just one more on top of it, how much is cannibalization weight on same-store sales and margins historically?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, John, this is Rick. I\u2019ll go through those questions. So lower marketing is part of the 100 million to 150 million \u2013 100 basis points to 150 basis points. I\u2019m sorry. But most of that is going to be from our labor efficiencies that we\u2019ve come to play. As sales go back up depending on what the competitive environment looks like we will market. I mean, Olive Garden is a national brand. And one of the benefits of Olive Garden is their scale and their national footprint. So Olive Garden will be on TV nationally, because we think that\u2019s a big competitive advantage for us. And so marketing will come back not to the level it was before, but most of our 100 to 150 basis points is going to be on the labor front. As it relates to unit potential, while we\u2019re not going to give a number on units, Gene did mention Olive Garden, seeing that we could potentially go into smaller markets because of the business model enhancements that we\u2019ve made, but other brands are going to fill in markets. I mean, one of the things that Gene mentioned earlier about Cheddar\u2019s is, they don\u2019t have scale, they really don\u2019t have a whole lot of scale in most of the markets there are in either. So we really believe in relative market share and we think Cheddar\u2019s has the opportunity, LongHorn has the opportunity, all of our brands have the opportunity to build scale in some markets they are in, while still growing into new markets. And in regards to cannibalization, we haven\u2019t given that number in a long time. And most of the cannibalization would be at Olive Garden. And Olive Garden isn\u2019t growing that many restaurant, so the cannibalization isn\u2019t that impactful for us. And as it relates to the other brands, as we do go into some markets that we already have restaurants in, because we\u2019re so, especially for Cheddar\u2019s, because we\u2019re so disbursed on where we \u2013 where our restaurants are. When we add a new restaurant, yes, we will have some cannibalization, but the business model is so much better now that we believe that is the right thing to do, plus it actually leverages some of the G&A and other things in that market, even our supply chain. So while our restaurant level margins may tick down if we cannibalize, the cost outside the restaurant will get better.\nJon Tower: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nNicole Miller: Thank you. Good morning. Congrats to everybody. Two quick questions for me. The first is on numbers, with the guidance. Can you talk just a little bit more about what is underlying that? I would wonder about two things. I think you said like 75% of the dining rooms are open. So I can imagine you\u2019re contemplating all of those reopening, yet you are not contemplating everything closing. So what is kind of the spectrum there? And then on the comp, is it holding steady for dining rooms opened and the momentum they have achieved and \u2013 or are they also seeing some softness? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Nicole, this is Rick. As it relates to our guidance and then I\u2019ll get into the comp. We aren\u2019t assuming that we\u2019re contemplating any significant changes in net capacity restriction. So where we are today is where we\u2019re going to expect to be through the quarter. Other than those that are already contemplated by officials if there is some new ones coming then \u2013 that we already know about, but we don\u2019t know about any new ones coming. Now hopefully those things will ease as the quarter goes on. And so, we do have some \u2013 a little bit of that. I will give you \u2013 I want to give you a couple of data points. So as of Sunday our quarter-to-date on a fiscal basis, which is what you all look at, our comp sales were down about 26%. But if you look at it on a comparable calendar basis, because, remember, we had a 53 week last year and Thanksgiving shifted, we\u2019re down 35%, as Gene mentioned, over the first 2 weeks. So our guidance takes all that into account, it takes into account that we think that our sales are going to maybe grow a little bit on a per op week basis or on average unit volume basis, but because we are going up against that high seasonal sales last year our comps will be a little bit more challenged. And so that led to the second part of your question of what are we seeing in comps for restaurants that still have dining rooms open. We\u2019re now getting into our seasonal period, so we\u2019re getting into that point that we talked about after Q1 and recently mentioned on today\u2019s prepared remarks is that, our comps are going to be harder. What I would focus everybody on is our average weekly sales. And if you look at our press release that we shared, we still have average weekly sales growing. Unfortunately not growing as fast as average weekly sales grew last year, which we knew would happen and we highlighted that. So we\u2019re focusing more on Q4 next year. We believe we have the business to get us through that and we\u2019re really comfortable with the guidance that we gave for Q3, but we\u2019re really focusing on getting our business really ready to capitalize on when sales come back.\nNicole Miller: That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you. And to your point on \u2013 yes, looking to this quarter and looking to the next, absolutely, that just leads me to my second last question is exactly that. There is not even just the thought process anymore about these bigger chains like yourselves being able to take share. But it\u2019s absolutely model by seeing the consensus estimate, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. And I want to understand what do you think about that? What\u2019s the opportunity for sales transfer? Does the NRE saying 110,000 locations are closed what\u2019s all the type and location and health? What\u2019s the probability in the interim that you pick up those sales? I mean, we are hope for an independent revival, but that\u2019s going to take time. Has consensus been too optimistic on that front or is that what is happening is going to happen? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes, Nicole. I don\u2019t want to comment on where consensus is for Q4 or beyond. But what I do want to get everybody understanding is, before the pandemic the full service restaurant business was about $100 billion category. We believe after the pandemic, it\u2019s going to be $100 billion or more category. I mean, we also know that unfortunately there have been a lot of restaurants that have closed and there might be more that are coming. We really are unhappy with that, we really like to see these independents stay opened, as Gene mentioned, because they do provide some novelty and flare that we can learn from as well. But as we think about our business in the long run, full service restaurants was a big category, we had about an 8% share, 9% share, we believe it\u2019s going to be at least as big, potentially bigger because of the pent-up demand and people really understanding and realizing what they missed out of casual dining and full service restaurants. And so, if restaurant stays close for a while, we are bound to pick up some of that share. How much that is? I can\u2019t comment on it, but we believe we\u2019re really, really well prepared to capture that share. And with the business model that we have, we believe that we\u2019re going to benefit from that.\nNicole Miller: Thanks again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning and congratulations to all of your promotions. A follow-up on your comment so far about how Darden is transforming the business model for the long-term, you mentioned how simplification and productivity will result in a longer-term margin step up and that can lead to greater unit growth opportunities down the road. That\u2019s great. And I think to get that, one thing I\u2019m curious about is about this whole crisis and your internal actions, has the business been transformed in a way than your major brands that is going to bolster sales per restaurant long-term perhaps some year like fiscal \u201823 might be higher than it would have been without the crisis and your internal actions. I\u2019d be curious to hear about that?\nGene Lee: Yes, David. I think \u2013 as this crisis has done a few things. I think it\u2019s not just for the restaurant business, but for our business. I\u2019ve listened to all the CEOs talk. I mean we\u2019ve identified a lot of non-value-added activity inside our organizations that you are funding, but also was creating distractions at the operational level. And I think that\u2019s a big upside for us and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re really focused on to ensure that there is not \u2013 there is not this gravitational pull to bring us back to do that type of work. What gives me the most confidence in our ability to get above pre-pandemic sales is the investments we\u2019ve made. And from the minute after \u2013 day after April 20, when we raised $500 million in the equity offering and we knew liquidity wasn\u2019t going to be an issue. This management team focus 100% on what do we need to do to ensure our businesses are stronger than they were before the crisis? What actions, what investments do you want to make? What things that you do in history that turned out to be wrong that you want to make right? And our businesses have worked hard to do that. Now each one of our brand is in a different place on that journey. I think our bigger brands are much further along at this point and they\u2019ve made the moves. And what I\u2019m really impressed with is, the stuff that they\u2019re working on today, at the level of detail are trying to improve guest satisfaction to me is absolutely amazing. Words down to \u2013 we\u2019re spending a lot of time working on how do we improve our \u2013 the off-premise experience and how do we ensure the food at 15 minutes if it\u2019s not going to go back into a microwave is in it\u2019s optimal eating point or what it look like at 30 minutes when it goes back into the microwave. So there\u2019s just a tremendous amount of work and investment being made. And what I would call the second level that I think is going to pay big dividends. We\u2019ve invested a lot back into quality and value and our brands. And I\u2019m really excited about that and the guests are telling us that they are noticing these changes.\nDavid Palmer: Is kitchen capacity an issue at Olive Garden? I mean can you kind of \u2013 the step changes happen without you running into bottlenecks and thresholds where the experiences compromised on either off-premise or on-premise?\nGene Lee: No, actually the opposite, David, because we have removed a lot of the extraneous products that we are trying to serve, we were getting 0.5% of sales out off. And then we really through our menu \u2013 in our menu engineering, we are moving the high value, high satisfaction more of those items through to our guests. And we \u2013 the more we make the better we get. So actually, everything we\u2019re working on today, speed is taken into account and that holds the simplification of that process. You guys have heard me talk about this \u2013 you probably tired of me talking about it. A great kitchen starts with how the product comes in the backdoor and we got to streamline all those processes until it get to the table. And during this crisis we\u2019ve been able to reevaluate all that activity and all those processes and we\u2019re so far along that journey today and that\u2019s what gives me confidence about the future.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Setyan with Wedbush Securities. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nNick Setyan: Thank you, and congratulations on all the promotions. As the recent months progressed, the strength of the consumer in the context of the dining room capacities was a positive surprise. Is there a way to tease out that? How strong the consumer now is as the reversals happen and the dining room closures accelerate. Is there a way to tease out whether part of it is also the customer just spending less?\nGene Lee: Yes. Nick. We haven\u2019t really seen a whole lot of difference in our check average, so that\u2019s one way to think about the consumer and how strong they are. And as you look at our week to week sales in dining rooms that are open, they are still growing. Now, it\u2019s really hard to tease out consumer strength versus people going out for holidays or people actually curbing their spending because maybe they were self-quarantining before Thanksgiving and those kind of things. So it\u2019s really tough to see that other than the fact that our check really hasn\u2019t had a big dip.\nNick Setyan: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great, thank you. Good morning. Two things for me. The first, just in thinking through what off-premise sales could look like in a normal operating environment whenever that may be. Can you share where sales were from \u2013 on the off-premise side in markets where the dining recovery maybe was farthest along, or anything you\u2019ve gleaned from your customer data that\u2019s informing your thinking around post pandemic off-premise sales? And then the second question, as you mentioned adding brands to the portfolio, has the COVID environment either created more or fewer attractive opportunities for acquisitions or multiples less or more of an inhibitor now than they were before. Just any comments around the M&A environment would be great.\nGene Lee: Yes. First on the off-premise capacity \u2013 on the off-premise capacity, what I would say is, it\u2019s hard to get your arms around it, because you still have capacity restrictions in your restaurant if you living with the six feet. So there is still a lot of people that pull up to our doors that realize that we\u2019ve got to hour wait and then they transition to an off-premise experience. So we really don\u2019t have a feel for where that\u2019s going to level out. And I think I said last quarter, we actually see a scenario where that could actually fall down to below pre-pandemic levels once you open up the dine rooms, because there\u2019ll be less demand for it. And then we believe it will come back at a higher level than it was pre-pandemic. But we don\u2019t have a feel for where that\u2019s going to settle in right now. Because I think everybody\u2019s behavior is so modified in this environment. I\u2019m really not going to comment on the M&A environment any further than what I\u2019ve already said.\nAndrew Strelzik: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nAndy Barish: Hey, guys. A lot of kind of medium and long-term questions. I just wanted to kind of think about the fourth quarter, given obviously there is impossible number of variables to try to project at this time, but if the environment kind of stays the same as it is, I mean, historically your 4Q has looked a lot like your 3Q, is that how we should kind of be thinking about things on a high level?\nGene Lee: Hey, Andy. Our fourth quarter isn\u2019t that different than third quarter. We\u2019ve got Mother\u2019s Day in Q4, so that\u2019s a really big day for us. While it\u2019s not as seasonally high as Q3, it\u2019s not that different.\nAndy Barish: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nBrett Levy: Great. Thanks for taking the time sharing all this information. Congratulations to all of the team members who were elevated and all the people who actually helped them get there. I guess just one data question if you\u2019d be willing to share. And then just second question on that. The first is on market share. Would you care to share what Olive Garden and LongHorn were X and if you had any thoughts on positive units just across those two systems? And then just a second question, we have talked a lot about technology and the people, how are you thinking about the physical boxes, the existing ones, the new ones with all of these transformative issues that you are dealing with, whether it\u2019s tack or people or just how the consumers are looking and some of the structural issues you dealt with at Olive Garden. How are you thinking about what you need to do to your current and your future boxes? Thank you and good luck.\nGene Lee: Yes, Brett. As we get the share information pretty lagging, so we\u2019re usually a quarter behind to see what kind of share we\u2019ve gained in Olive Garden and Longhorn. So I really can\u2019t really comment on that. I would assume that we\u2019ve gained share based on based on the industry data. I mean, because we\u2019re looking at total industry, so a lot of restaurants were shut down. As far as our boxes, and I think the biggest thing that we\u2019re looking at right now and I mentioned this earlier, is that we, believe the off-premise experience will be driven by Curbside enabled by technology. We were on a pathway in our big brands to really developed space that\u2019s consumer facing to deal off-premise experience where the consumer came into the building to get it. So now we\u2019re looking at that and we\u2019re trying to develop ways to adapt the current facilities to make that space non-consumer facing and closer to the kitchen so it should actually cost less longer term as we make these adjustments. We have just built the new prototype in Orlando for all of Garden with a dedicated consumer facing off-premise experienced more like a, what I would call, a fast casual type restaurant/and now we\u2019ve determined that\u2019s not necessary, so that\u2019s good news on that [indiscernible]. And so, our team is working real hard to figure out what these adjustments will look like, they will target those investments in the high volume off-premise locations and they\u2019ll react and get that done over the next couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. I don\u2019t think this was touched on in any of the questions. But you did mentioned technology you\u2019re making. And I think it was field level management more effective and more efficient. So I wanted to explore whether that has been fully implemented in the field and the regional manager ranks. And exactly, I guess how big that could be? And then secondly, as you do think about repopulating the restaurants, is there a possibility of changing the mix between manager and hourly employees? Do you think you actually may have an opportunity to run more efficient restaurants from a managerial perspective as as we return back to normal?\nGene Lee: Hey, John. Good questions. I think from a technology standpoint, there is nothing we\u2019re adding to help our supervision. We\u2019ve got some \u2013 we got management information systems that we\u2019ve been well developed over the years, we continue to evolve those, streamline those, try to get them the most important information that they need to run their businesses. I think the biggest challenge there is how to not giving too much information and parallelism and so I think that will be one thing that I think Rick will look at in his new role, especially with his technology background as how to fine tune that platform to ensure that they\u2019re getting the information they need, but not too much information. As far as the team member management mix. I don\u2019t see any gain, we\u2019ve always been efficient maybe more efficient than I think a lot of our competitors are at that level. We use key employees to supplement as a supplement to management but also as a development program is a gateway into our management program. So I think we\u2019re pretty lean there and I don\u2019t see our technology is going to change that at all. I mean I\u2019m always going to want a Management person in the business, in the facility leading, these large groups of people. I think the difference in casual dining and I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why it doesn\u2019t franchise all that well, these are complex businesses with lots of team members. And if you\u2019re not doing this business over the counter. And the one thing that off-premise has added is, added more complexity as you\u2019re dealing with 10 or 12 at a time in your parking lot as you bring in the food out. So the businesses in some ways getting more complex as you try to deliver food through different channels. So I don\u2019t see a whole lot of cost savings there.\nJohn Ivankoe: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nGregory Francfort: Hey, thanks. I\u2019ll keep it brief. I just had a follow-up to Palmer\u2019s question about the menu. And can you maybe talk about from two quarters ago to today. How your thoughts might have changed on re-expanding the menu. You shrunk it quite a bit and I think customers are okay with that. Are they still okay with it and just have you stock on re-expanding it change at all? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Yes, good question, Greg. I think that \u2013 obviously, we shrunk it for many reasons, primarily supply chain and then just from a labor productivity standpoint. We\u2019ve been very judicious as we brought the products back. We think we\u2019ve through our turf studies we think that we\u2019ve satisfied everybody on the \u2013 any consumer and offer them places that they would want to go and eat specific menu. What we\u2019re really focused on is, eliminating duplicity in the menu where you have a menu item, it does the same thing someone else did. I think that [indiscernible] has a very broadly appealing menu but yet limited number of items you have to figure out what Hill Stoner or Houston\u2019s environment where they touch everything in each category that you might want as a consumer, but they do it with 15 menu items. And so I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do is to ensure that we don\u2019t have duplicative. And I think the example I would use is, in Longhorn as an appetizer you don\u2019t need both wild west shrimp and [indiscernible], it\u2019s the same consumer that\u2019s going to buy the product. And so what we\u2019re working on is, how do we end up with the unique product and a product that you can only get in our restaurant, that\u2019s very craveable and that differentiates you. And having two products that do the same thing and one is not \u2013 one is ubiquitous and one is differentiated, it makes no sense to me. And so that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. So, over time, yes, [indiscernible] product there, yes. But what you have to have, you have to have discipline. And the discipline is, you have to take stuff off. And we have been demonstrating that as an industry over the last 15 years and we need to demonstrate that moving forward.\nGregory Francfort: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jared Gardner with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nJared Gardner: Good morning, thanks and congratulations to the team on respected promotions as well. Just a quick one for me. Wanted to get an understanding of the potential opportunity in sort of the family ordering or catering business, is that something that over the long-term, when things normalize and consumers tend to come back to the restaurants, is that another business that can be maybe bigger than it was in the past, as we think about consumers may be adopting more of an at-home occasion and in-restaurant dining occasion?\nGene Lee: Yes. We are very strong in that. In Olive Garden already \u2013 obviously, we sell [indiscernible]. So that\u2019s a big part of our business. Where we\u2019re seeing some growth right now is in Cheddar\u2019s with that business with family packs. We\u2019ve also had some success in our upscale brands being able to sell family packs, stakes and size that you can \u2013 that are \u2013 stakes aren\u2019t prepared but the size are prepared and we will give you instructions to reheat. And so we\u2019re calling family meals or family packs that are working very well. So I think it\u2019s something that we had some penetration. In Olive Garden, I think it will be bigger as we move forward. And it provide us an opportunity in some of our other businesses to get in that business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Rutherford with Stephens Inc. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nJames Rutherford: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just one quick one for me. Gene with the technology investments that you all have made around online ordering in Curbside, has your view changed at all in terms of the long-term mix of off-premise, where perhaps it doesn\u2019t that being a material higher mix longer term compared to where it was pre-pandemic. Of course, still this is maybe a slight bump but not huge kind of pre and post-pandemic? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes, I think it\u2019s a slight bump from pre-pandemic levels. I think that \u2013 I mean, listen, this was a growing piece of everyone\u2019s business has convenient to became more and more important. Maybe there is an opportunity for us to take more share in Olive Garden than I think, because the experience is going to be so frictionless, but we are going to see what the consumer demand is. What I am confident in, especially on the Olive Garden side and somewhat to Cheddar\u2019s is that, we will have \u2013 we will get our share in this business, we will get our share of the off-premise pie. And I think we\u2019ll do a really good job with it, and it will continue to grow over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nBrian Vaccaro: Thanks. And I echo the congrats on your promotions. Just two quick ones from me. I wanted to circle back on the labor discussion and you spoke to some tech investments. And I\u2019m curious what role you think server handhelds could play in the coming years with Florida and others potentially moving toward the path to 15 or perhaps there are other adjustments in the service model that you could see, maybe implementing while protecting the guest experience, just curious to get your thoughts there?\nGene Lee: Yes, I\u2019m not a big believer in trying to gain too much efficiency on the service side. I mean I think every time you say you\u2019re going to gain efficiency there, you\u2019ve really saying you\u2019re going to cut service. And we are full service restaurant. So when I think about the handhelds and technology for the service, I\u2019m thinking more about speed of service for our guest than saving money. I just \u2013 I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and I just \u2013 every time I\u2019ve tried to increase the efficiency in that part of the restaurant it doesn\u2019t end well for me. And so I am committed to keeping the service levels up. I think service is a big part of the value equation, that\u2019s a differentiator when you come into our restaurant versus go into a fast casual or fast food is, we got to provide a service. And there is a level that you\u2019re going to, you want to get to that minimum level, you want to do a better than your competitors and you want to earn your business that way. So I see the technology solution more as a benefit to the consumer not a benefit to us from a cost standpoint.\nBrian Vaccaro: Understood. Alright, that\u2019s helpful. And then shifting gears, quickly on the store margins, Rick, could you provide a little more perspective on the other OpEx line. Some more specifics on costs that are starting to normalize versus the lower spend levels in your fiscal Q2? And it looks like your guidance for Q3 and bed store margins that are in the ballpark of Q2. I know you mentioned emergency pay but, are there other changing cost dynamics that we should be mindful of, specifically in Q3 versus Q2? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Brian. The one cost that will continue to go up is repairs and maintenance. As I mentioned, we have dine in\u2019s closed, we don\u2019t have as much beating of our dining room. So we have \u2013 we\u2019ll have R&M start to tick up and it already started to tick up in Q2 as dining rooms reopen it also gives us the time to actually do some of that repair and maintenance while the dining are close. So we will have some of that coming up. Utilities go up as your dining rooms open and you\u2019ve got more utilities going that way. But again that\u2019s all contemplated in everything that we have in our guidance.\nBrian Vaccaro: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the questions and also congratulations to all. My first one is a quick one on LTOs in marketing. You mentioned that your marketing dollars would largely recover post-COVID. Do you expect to go back to the same sort of cadence you had on LTOs, are you rethinking kind of your promotional strategy longer term?\nGene Lee: We\u2019re totally rethinking our promotional strategy and how to effectively use that. There was a lot of good in what we did and we\u2019ve realized there was a lot of bad in what we did. And there\u2019s a lot of activity that goes into those. And as we evaluate that after the fact we believe there is a better way to do that. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not going to do LTOs, but we\u2019ve been out of them \u2013 we were out of LTOs and LongHorn for almost 2 years, pre-pandemic. And we have been able to make that adjustment. As we look at Olive Garden, we will continue to try to figure out what\u2019s the best way to use our scale advantage and market that business effectively, but also considering do we need to do six LTOs a year or are there other ways to do that more effectively.\nJake Bartlett: Got it. And then my last \u2013 my second and last question is, you talked about improvements to the business and kind of coming out of COVID I think it was a better business model. How do you think about or I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re ready yet to talk about it, but how do you think about the long-term growth algorithm that you\u2019ve talked about in the past as it pertains to unit growth, or maybe margin expansion opportunities. Are we still kind of thinking the 7% to 10% EBIT growth or you think we should think about that differently longer term?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Jack, this is Rick. I think if you \u2013 as you think about our long-term framework, we haven\u2019t adjusted our long-term framework. So as of now, we still believe we can get to those numbers over the long run. But as we\u2019ve always said, any one year could be above or below that. And so I would hope that FY\u201922 would be above that, because of where we were in FY\u201921, but in FY\u201921 and we\u2019re going to be below it. So in the long run, which is what we talk about to all of our investors and to all of you. We believe we can hit our long-term framework. And I will remind everybody that we\u2019ve been a public company since 1995. We\u2019ve never had a 10-year period where our average annual TSR has been below 10%. And even when \u2013 fiscal period. So even last year when we had the worst fourth quarter I think of any industry and of any one at least for us, we still had a 10-year TSR of over 10% on average.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: Great, thank you so much for squeezing me in. And let me just add my congrats to the three of you as well. I was just curious if you could give us some thoughts around how you are broadly thinking about the dividend? I know you mentioned sort of 50% payout relative to this quarter\u2019s EPS. So just in light of the upcoming guidance and some of the continued volatility that we\u2019re seeing in the external environment, how should we anticipate the dividend sort of progressing going forward? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes, Priya. As we know the dividends are important to our shareholders. We also know that the dividend policy is important to our bondholders. And as you think about our dividend and what we do, we typically set it within our long-term framework of 50% to 60% of our earnings. And the quarter that we just ended was at the low end of that, at 50%. We\u2019re going to continue to work with the Board on what our dividend is going forward, but going farther than this quarter, it\u2019s kind of hard for me to say, because the board is the one that decides a dividend, but we did contemplate what we think our guidance was in Q3 when we set our dividend in Q2. So we always look forward to see what we think our cash flows are going to be to ensure that the dividend is safe. And so that\u2019s why we set the dividend of $0.37 this quarter.\nPriya Ohri-Gupta: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nGene Lee: Thanks, Priya.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s Q&A session for the call. I would like to turn it back over to Mr. Kalicak.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you everyone for participating. That concludes our call for today. I\u2019d like to remind you that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday, March 23, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you and happy holidays.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gene Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. As we continue to operate in a very fluid environment and I was pleased with our ability to once again deliver strong profitability in an unpredictable sales environment. Total sales from continuing operations were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%, same-restaurant sales decreased 20.6% and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74. The last 2 weeks of the quarter negatively impacted our same-restaurant sales by approximately 200 basis points as we quickly went from 97% of our dining rooms being opened in the middle of the quarter to only 80% being open at the end of the quarter. As a reminder, Thanksgiving shifted back into our second quarter this year and we believe just modified their behavior in advance of the holiday. During the quarter, we remain focused on four key priorities. The health and safety of our team members and guests, in restaurant execution in the complex operating environment, deploying technology to improve the guest experience and transforming our business model. The health and safety of our team members and guest has always been our top priority. We continue to follow latest guidance from the CDC as well as our own enhanced safety protocols to create a safe environment for everyone. This includes daily team member health monitoring, requiring mask for every team member, enhanced cleaning procedures and social distancing protocols. I'm proud of the commitment our teams make every day to keep our guests and each other safe. Second, our restaurant teams remain focused on our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy to drive restaurant level execution that results in great guest experiences whether our guests are dining with us or ordering curbside to-go. Our teams have been operating in this environment for 10 months, and they have become very adept at adjusting to the ever-changing COVID restrictions, but it's still not easy. That's why we remain committed to our simplified operations, including streamline menus, processes and procedures which continue to strengthen our execution and our guest satisfaction metrics confirm that our restaurant teams are doing a great job delivering exceptional guest experience in this challenging environment. Third, we continue to deploy technology to improve the guest experience. Our brands benefit from the technology platform Darden provides, allowing each of them to compete more effectively by harnessing the power of our digital tools, including the 25 million email addresses in our marketing database. During the quarter, Olive Garden LongHorn Steakhouse launched refresh websites and all our brands continue to use their digital storefronts effectively. More than 55% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital transactions where guest ordered and paid online. And at Olive Garden, 20% of our total sales for the quarter were digital. During the quarter, we also rolled out Curbside I am Here which allows our guests to easily notify the restaurant that they've arrived to pick up their curbside to-go order by simply tapping on a link embedded in a text message. As a result, our operators are spending less time on the phone and more time focused on ensuring orders are accurate and on-time, which is leading to improved guest satisfaction scores. We also introduced Wait List Visibility, allowing guest to see their place on the waiting list using their phone regardless of whether they have checked in online or in person. And we're working on several other initiatives, including streamlining our online checkout process and adding additional mobile payment options to provide even more convenience for our guest. We continue to accelerate our digital journey, and I'm encouraged by the progress we are making. Finally, we continue to view this environment as a rare opportunity to transform our business model for long-term growth. We continue to make investments in our team members, product quality and portion sizes to ensure we emerge even stronger and better positioned to grow share. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales declined 19.9% as capacity restrictions continue to limit their top-line sales. Olive Garden began November with 56 dining rooms closed, and that number accelerated to 208 by the end of the month. However, they were able to deliver strong average weekly sales during the quarter of more than 73,000 per restaurant, retaining 80% of last year's sales. Olive Garden also continued to realize operational efficiencies and strengthened margin as a result of their simplified menu and the elimination of promotional activity, including discounts. In the current limited capacity environment, their reduced marketing spend was focused on showcasing the convenience of their off-premise experience, while featuring compelling core menu items rather than limited time promotions. This led to increased segment profit margin, while making additional investments in abundance and value. Additionally, off-premise sales grew 83% in the quarter, representing 39% of total sales. Enabled by the technology investments I mentioned earlier, Olive Garden improved their to-go experience and achieved another all-time high in guest satisfaction for having orders ready to pick up at the time promised. Finally, Olive Garden successfully opened three new restaurants in the quarter. LongHorn Steakhouse had another solid quarter. Same-restaurant sales declined 11.1%. Almost 20% of their restaurants grew same-restaurant sales in the quarter. They also successfully opened three new restaurants during the quarter. The LongHorn team remains laser focused on their strategy of increasing the quality of their guest experience, simplifying operations to drive execution and leveraging their unique culture to increase team member engagement. During the quarter, the team did a great job of managing controllable costs while their simplified menu drove improved labor productivity. Finally, LongHorn grew off-premise sales by more than 175%, representing 22% of total sales. Now I will turn it over to Rick. Thanks, Rick. This morning, we also announced that Rick will become our President and Chief Operating Officer. Rick's career represents what our industry is all about. He joined Darden as a Buster at Red Lobster 1984 and has worked extremely hard mastering many functions. On January 4, he will become the President of the world's largest full service restaurant company. He's been a great partner to me over the last five years, and I look forward to working side-by-side with him in his new role. Additionally, we announced that Raj Vennam will become our Chief Financial Officer. Raj began his career at Darden in 2003, and has done an exceptional job in every role he has held. His promotion recognizes the significant contributions he has made to our individual brands as well as the greater organization. With a brilliant mind and a keen understanding of our industry, Raj is the perfect person to take over for Rick. I'm excited to see him expand his role in the company as CFO. Rick and Raj are here with me in the room today, and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate both of them. I want to close by recognizing our team members in the restaurants and at the support center. I can't say enough about the dedication they've demonstrated throughout the year. Their focus, commitment and determination is exceptional. With multiple jurisdictions implementing dining room closures, we know many team members will not get the hours they needed during this holiday season. That is why we have reintroduced our emergency pay program that will provide three weeks of emergency pay to team members who are furloughed from their restaurant when dining rooms are closed. Our [indiscernible] greatest competitive advantage and we are committed to taking care of them. On behalf of the management team and the board of directors, I want to thank all our team members for your tireless effort to serve our community by providing the comfort of a warm meal. Thank you for going to the extraordinary lines to take care of our guests and each other. I wish you all a safe and a happy holiday season. And with that, we will take your questions. No, absolutely not. I plan on being as involved operationally there, that's my strength. I mean, I see this as a opportunity to create growth for both Rick and Raj. I think it's going to give Rick an opportunity to understand operations more deeply. Obviously, he has a great relationship with our presidents today, but I think it's important for him and his development to get a little deeper into the operations and get to know and oversee a lot of the other people that make things happen, just not the president. I also think it's important for him to partner with me on making sure that we are leveraging all the non-consumer-facing parts of our business and to see if there is an opportunity to continue to find additional synergies to enable us to further invest in our business. So I see this as an opportunity to work with people that deserve the opportunity to grow. And more importantly, have an extra set of hands to be able to do some things and look at things maybe a little bit differently. Giving Rick the freedom and the time to look across the organization and see where we can pick up some additional synergy I think is a good thing. I think that I tried to do that even in a position that was in, but I know there is a limit to the amount of time you have. I think giving Rick that time will be very beneficial to the organization as we move forward. So I am excited about these changes. It has \u2013 I don't think anybody should read anything into it. I am going to still be heavily involved in food servicing atmosphere, just the way I am today, and I look at it as a great opportunity. I also look forward to working with Raj and giving him a chance to develop into a world-class Chief Financial Officer, and I think that's going to be really exciting. So don't read anything into it other than we're creating growth for our people, creating new opportunities and we have a few things that we want to get done with this change. Yes. We have no definitive plans to put back marketing at this point in time. Obviously, we have developed multiple options of how to come back and use those resources that we have. But I think \u2013 and part of your question, I think the answer is there is that we're going to look and see what the competitive environment is like, we want to see what the pent-up demand is like and we're going to put back the marketing \u2013 put marketing resources back in the business judiciously. And I would love to get to a point where we can grow our business and rely a little less on advertising spend. We really like the P&Ls with the marketing line at the level it's at right now. And so there is no predetermined outcome on this. We just \u2013 we need to get into the competitive environment and then make our decisions then. We have developed multiple options if needed. No, I don't think \u2013 I mean, I think that my position on closure is still in that 5% to 15% range. And it's unfortunate that a lot of these small businesses are being impacted this way, because I do think it has a \u2013 it will have a negative impact on our \u2013 on the productivity of our industry, so on so forth. So as far as real estate goes, I think that my position on that is still pretty much the same is that there is some more availability out there right now. However, we're not seeing any weakness in the rent deals. I think what we are \u2013 I think there is some speculation going on out there right now with some of the REITs. So I think as we move forward, we will continue to try to grow our businesses responsibly. We want to eventually get back into our long-term framework. We'll give you some more guidance in March exactly how we're thinking about FY \u201822 for development. But we reconfirmed our guidance for this year and hoping that we can get the number of restaurants that we talked about in the press release open. And we have a bunch of restaurants today sitting there ready to go and that are ready to open. We just need to \u2013 our guideline here is, once we get to approximately 50% occupancy in a jurisdiction, we will go ahead and open that restaurant, and we've been very successful doing that. Good question, Brian. I think we think about it in three ways, right? What are we doing to ensure that we can grow the base from a same-restaurant sales perspective. And I think a lot of the simplification and efficiency \u2013 and the efficiencies that we're creating. But more importantly, and I think I talked about this in the last call was, as we brought our menus down, we learned a lot about guest behavior and what the guest wanted to buy without our nudge. And I think that's really been eye opening for us. And I think that that's going to strengthen the operation and day-to-day operation on that side. So I really think that we're well positioned there. We have done a lot of good work to ensure that our brand is set up for success. Secondly, we talked about transformation. And when we go to second bucket of growth, which is new restaurants, the key here is that we believe that the business model from a cost side is much stronger than it was pre-pandemic, which should enable us to be able to grow, especially in Olive Garden, deeper than we may have thought we would be able to grow pre-pandemic. So that's one of the things I'm really excited about is, we think that we can actually over time tick up Olive Garden growth and handle \u2013 because of the improvements we've made, we think we can handle the cannibalization a little bit better and still get a good return on our investment. The third bucket that you highlighted was really around how do we continue to add brands to the platform? And as I've said forever, we continue to look at what our options are. The filter that we use really comes down to does the \u2013 does it benefit us to put that brand on the platform? Does the platform benefit that brand? Do we think it can grow faster than Olive Garden to improve our growth rate? And we've historically done something every three or four years. This has obviously been a different period of time. But we believe that to be an avenue of our growth and to support our long-term framework. And so I think we're really well positioned in all of those \u2013 in those three buckets to drive the business. The last thing that I would say is I think that \u2013 in this transformation, it's moved a lot of the technology forward faster than what we originally were planning to do. And the big change for us is moving from \u2013 moving how we handle the off-premise business, which has been a big part of our growth historically the last 5 years as we capture the convenience trend. But really getting clarity that this is going to be a curbside business, it's going to be technologically enabled versus someone coming to the restaurant and getting out of the car and coming to pick it up. And I think that we've really worked hard and our team has done a great job. And I think that experience today, when you come into an Olive Garden, especially Olive Garden and LongHorn, in all our brands, but really this is an Olive Garden play because of the food travel so well. I think that that's going to really be a competitive advantage going forward. Well, I think there were still geographic problems, and I would say that we were really adhering to the social distancing. But the business \u2013 in some ways I gave you that because I said we \u2013 the last two weeks cost us 200 basis points for the quarter. And so I think there were parts of the country that were performing really well, and I think you can look at the mobility index out there and see what parts of the country were performing well. And so if you look at Georgia and Texas, Florida hasn't been performing as well just because of tourism is down and we have a lot of restaurants based in tourism. But in our non-tourist markets in Florida we're performing well. So we had some good momentum, but we all \u2013 we knew as a management team that we weren't \u2013 this wasn't done, that we're going to face this second wave and we are prepared for it. And we had good processes and we've been able to wind down the businesses effectively to off-premise-only and then we'll quickly be able to wind them back up and take advantage of the opportunity. I will let our new President answer that. Yes. Good morning, Jeff. Labor is definitely is a little bit of a question mark for us and for the industry. But as we think about labor, we've dealt with the structural increases over time very effectively. We are better positioned than anybody else in the industry to be able to deal with that because where our margins are today. Do I \u2013 at the bottom if you're asking me, do I think there'll be a federal minimum wage increase that's similar to Florida, I think over time we will see federal minimum wage increase, but not at the same rate as Florida. I think the key for us and the way we're thinking about it is, how do we get to the right tip wage and to keep that relationship between the constituents \u2013 two constituents, the guest and the server that don't want that relationship to change, albeit people in public office and some advocacy groups believe that that relationship should change where our team members in service really don't want that to change. So how do we protect that, get that to the right level. If we're all \u2013 if the industry at all faced with it then, we are going to have to figure out how from a pricing standpoint we are able to pass that through. I think long-term, when I look at the P&L and think about it, I think it's \u2013 California is an example of it today. You're going to end up with a little bit lower cost of goods sold and a little bit higher labor cost, but you're going to end up at the same place. And so as long as you are thinking about that way, I'm confident in our ability to manage that over the long-term. Could it have some short-term impacts and volatility of the cost structure? Yes. But long-term, I like where we are positioned and our ability to be able to deal with it. No, we believe we're an on-premise restaurant company. And we believe \u2013 we strongly believe that demand for in-restaurant dining is going to come back really strong. There'll be some fall-off on the off-premise occasion. I think people have a lot of fatigue with that right now. Long-term, convenience is going to \u2013 when you think about long-term, convenience is still going to be important. But I think that \u2013 and off-premise will come back and be strong and be stronger at some point than it was pre-COVID. But I believe that these are \u2013 these brands need to be developed to be on-premise locations that as your primary business that drives an auxiliary business, which is your off-premise location, off-premise business, but you developed the brand in a box and we create in-restaurant \u2013 great in-restaurant experience. And the logistics of moving that the last mile are just so so expensive and something that we know really cuts into the profitability and some that we don't want to be involved in. Yes. I think we've talked about in the last call the biggest transformation we've made in the cost structure has been at Cheddar's. As we simplified the menu, we really were able to get in there and look at all the processes and procedures from the backdoor to the dining room table. And the team has made great progress there, which has resulted in a significant reduction in labor cost. And we've got a significant reduction in the waste in that business around cost of goods sold, which has really changed the business model. Prior to the pandemic, we had just rolled out at every single guest which has been received very well, and we were able to absorb the pricing that we implemented. When we did that, our value ratings have actually increased. I think the other thing that going through this crisis has accelerated is their off-premise capabilities. Prior to the pandemic, we did not have a ton of capabilities there. We didn't \u2013 we really had a couple of phone lines, but it was just a mess. So we've increased the number of phone lines. We've got online ordering in place. We've now got the Curbside I'm Here in there. And it takes our businesses growing fairly rapidly through the pandemic, and we're very pleased with that. We've got to get better at it because it's not a core competency in Cheddar's, but I think the team has been working really hard on it and I know they have got a big initiative, and I'm really proud of what they are doing. As far as unit growth goes, we've really \u2013 I always talk about human resources than we talk about unit growth. We've stabilized the human resources in Cheddar's. The human resource metrics are getting closer to Darden metrics. I think actually management turnover is actually in the middle now after being such an outlier for so long. So I am excited about that. But we still need to build management strength to handle growth. Now we have been opening restaurants all the way through the transition, through the pandemic and through \u2013 really through the integration. And I would expect unit growth to be somewhere in that 5% to 8% range, which I think we can handle from a human resource standpoint. So it's additive to our growth rate. We're excited about the business. We're excited to see what the P&L will really look like in a post-pandemic environment. And we've always loved the business and we love the business today, and we're excited about it. We've got \u2013 team has done a great job, I'm really proud of them. No, I just don't have \u2013 we don't have the density in that business to be cost effective from a marketing standpoint. I think we'll continue to use the digital \u2013 our digital capabilities there. But really, it was always a high volume concept that didn't have the cost structure set up right. Now we have the cost structure set up \u2013 we think set up right and doing 5,000 guests a week. I think that the growth in that business really comes from new units not really comp growth. There is not many restaurant companies out there doing 5,000 guests a week. Yes. John, I think what investors have to do is make assumptions for when the pandemic starts to ease and when dining room restrictions kind of \u2013 when dining rooms reopen and then look at our average unit volumes what we're doing today and kind of put some kind of a factor on that. And you can kind of see some of the things that we've shown in our releases and pretty transparent on our weekly sales and restaurants that have dining rooms opened versus the total company and just kind of make your best guesses on when do you think the pandemic is going to wane and when dining rooms are going to reopen. We can't tell you when that is, but we feel really confident that when that does happen, we're going to be there to capitalize on it. I think \u2013 first of all, I think technology really helps you on the off-premise side. As we talk to our guest, they continue to talk \u2013 tell us they don't want a technologically advanced or enabled in-restaurant experience. They don't want to look at digital menus. I mean, as we put the QR codes out there and have people try to look at the menus on their phone, they really pushed back, they don't like that. And so that trend I don't think is going to take place in restaurant. We are playing with some handheld devices to see if we can get orders quicker. I think that kiosk has played a major role in a lot of our brands. It's enabled our servers to in a non-pandemic time be able to use that device to get orders in. It really does a great job on payment. The option rate on payment is extremely high with that device as the consumer becomes used to using it. So in restaurant, I don't see a ton of technological advances there over time. I think the things that we are working on, you know Wait List is important. Again, the big one that we're working on right now is how do you accelerate the checkout process on an online order and how can that be as friendly as the big retailers. And so those types of things on the margin I think technology is there. We are fairly technologically advanced with our dining room system, our KDS system. I'm not sure how much more is there that we see right now. We are working on a technology roadmap over the next five years to figure out where do we want to invest and how do we get the highest return on that. And so there is still work to be done. I think the majority of it still is in off-premise to accelerate that. And then on the other side, we don't talk much about, but when you think about the size of our email database today and how we interact with our guests digitally. We will continue to evolve that and get better at that and more efficient with that. Trying to figure how to communicate more effectively with our consumers and let them know about the things that might drive a visit. And so I'm excited about that. There is a lot of engagement digitally with our brand, both from an email database, but from social. Just think about what happened last week when Taylor Swift dropped the song with Olive Garden in it, and how we were able to capture that socially and create buzz around that. And all of a sudden, when Taylor Swift drops our name in a song, our brand becomes very, very relevant. It's a 40-plus year old brand that's all of a sudden relevant with her audience. And our team was working around the clock to capitalize on that activity. And to those that are listening that were on that team, they did a fantastic job to be able to make that relevant. So, thank you to them and thank you to Taylor Swift for dropping Olive Garden in her song. Yes. When you think about, when you have no indoor dining, a big part of our restaurant is the servers and \u2013 so that's a little bit less, actually, a little less efficient in number of hours than in our premise business. On dollars it's not so bad, but on an hour's basis you have a lot more servers per guests then you do wanted to go \u2013 to go experience. So actually it does help us a little bit when we go to off premise only, just for a little bit of time. We actually don't like to be off premise only, we would much rather have the total sales and the total margin of being open on premise. And in relation to the fixed versus variable, that \u2013 as the definition says, the variable cost definitely go way down as we \u2013 our sales go down. Most of our costs on the fixed side will be there. We have a few things that we can turn off, when we go to off-premise only. The TVs, the music and those kind of things, but that's not significant. The other thing that is significant as we have a little less repair and maintenance. When you're restaurant isn't getting beat up in the dining room, you don't have to do as much repairs there. But I would say, we would much rather have a full restaurant full dining rooms and deal with the cost of that, then have empty dining rooms and just do off-premise. Well, I think that \u2013 I mean that's hard for us to really define for you. I think that from our standpoint, we can \u2013 other than maybe having a ramp up in staffing, we can get right \u2013 we can get to a point where we can move back to 100% fairly quickly of where we were from a volume standpoint. And I think even staffing would be more of a fatigue thing, because we probably have to work our people more hours than what they were used to in the near-term, but I think we can get there right away. The question is going to be more on the consumer demand is that, is this going to come back in all at once or is it going to come back over a period of time as more and more people get comfortable. You think about the different demographics out there today, and is it going \u2013 our people is going to, as soon as they are vaccinated say, Okay, I can get out and move or are they still going to be cautious. And that to us is the unknown. But what I would tell everybody on the call and our investors is that, we're going to be prepared to be able to handle the situation as it unfolds. And we're going to be in a situation where I think that our brands are trusted and beloved by our guest and that people once they feel good about being able to have a little bit more mobility, they're going to come back to as quickly and we're going to be ready to serve them a great meal and deliver on our expectation. It's still our position, we believe that we need to stay focused on running the brands that we spent many, many years investing and marketing and building. And I believe that that's the right place to be. I believe, as I said last quarter, others have got to do what they think they need to do to run their business. I think the question I would ask is, who owns a virtual brand? Is the kitchen or just door dash on the virtual brand? Yes, Nicole. I don't want to comment on where consensus is for Q4 or beyond. But what I do want to get everybody understanding is, before the pandemic the full service restaurant business was about $100 billion category. We believe after the pandemic, it's going to be $100 billion or more category. I mean, we also know that unfortunately there have been a lot of restaurants that have closed and there might be more that are coming. We really are unhappy with that, we really like to see these independents stay opened, as Gene mentioned, because they do provide some novelty and flare that we can learn from as well. But as we think about our business in the long run, full service restaurants was a big category, we had about an 8% share, 9% share, we believe it's going to be at least as big, potentially bigger because of the pent-up demand and people really understanding and realizing what they missed out of casual dining and full service restaurants. And so, if restaurant stays close for a while, we are bound to pick up some of that share. How much that is? I can't comment on it, but we believe we're really, really well prepared to capture that share. And with the business model that we have, we believe that we're going to benefit from that. Yes, David. I think \u2013 as this crisis has done a few things. I think it's not just for the restaurant business, but for our business. I've listened to all the CEOs talk. I mean we've identified a lot of non-value-added activity inside our organizations that you are funding, but also was creating distractions at the operational level. And I think that's a big upside for us and it's something that we're really focused on to ensure that there is not \u2013 there is not this gravitational pull to bring us back to do that type of work. What gives me the most confidence in our ability to get above pre-pandemic sales is the investments we've made. And from the minute after \u2013 day after April 20, when we raised $500 million in the equity offering and we knew liquidity wasn't going to be an issue. This management team focus 100% on what do we need to do to ensure our businesses are stronger than they were before the crisis? What actions, what investments do you want to make? What things that you do in history that turned out to be wrong that you want to make right? And our businesses have worked hard to do that. Now each one of our brand is in a different place on that journey. I think our bigger brands are much further along at this point and they've made the moves. And what I'm really impressed with is, the stuff that they're working on today, at the level of detail are trying to improve guest satisfaction to me is absolutely amazing. Words down to \u2013 we're spending a lot of time working on how do we improve our \u2013 the off-premise experience and how do we ensure the food at 15 minutes if it's not going to go back into a microwave is in it's optimal eating point or what it look like at 30 minutes when it goes back into the microwave. So there's just a tremendous amount of work and investment being made. And what I would call the second level that I think is going to pay big dividends. We've invested a lot back into quality and value and our brands. And I'm really excited about that and the guests are telling us that they are noticing these changes. No, actually the opposite, David, because we have removed a lot of the extraneous products that we are trying to serve, we were getting 0.5% of sales out off. And then we really through our menu \u2013 in our menu engineering, we are moving the high value, high satisfaction more of those items through to our guests. And we \u2013 the more we make the better we get. So actually, everything we're working on today, speed is taken into account and that holds the simplification of that process. You guys have heard me talk about this \u2013 you probably tired of me talking about it. A great kitchen starts with how the product comes in the backdoor and we got to streamline all those processes until it get to the table. And during this crisis we've been able to reevaluate all that activity and all those processes and we're so far along that journey today and that's what gives me confidence about the future. Yes. Nick. We haven't really seen a whole lot of difference in our check average, so that's one way to think about the consumer and how strong they are. And as you look at our week to week sales in dining rooms that are open, they are still growing. Now, it's really hard to tease out consumer strength versus people going out for holidays or people actually curbing their spending because maybe they were self-quarantining before Thanksgiving and those kind of things. So it's really tough to see that other than the fact that our check really hasn't had a big dip. Yes. First on the off-premise capacity \u2013 on the off-premise capacity, what I would say is, it's hard to get your arms around it, because you still have capacity restrictions in your restaurant if you living with the six feet. So there is still a lot of people that pull up to our doors that realize that we've got to hour wait and then they transition to an off-premise experience. So we really don't have a feel for where that's going to level out. And I think I said last quarter, we actually see a scenario where that could actually fall down to below pre-pandemic levels once you open up the dine rooms, because there'll be less demand for it. And then we believe it will come back at a higher level than it was pre-pandemic. But we don't have a feel for where that's going to settle in right now. Because I think everybody's behavior is so modified in this environment. I'm really not going to comment on the M&A environment any further than what I've already said. Hey, Andy. Our fourth quarter isn't that different than third quarter. We've got Mother's Day in Q4, so that's a really big day for us. While it's not as seasonally high as Q3, it's not that different. Yes, Brett. As we get the share information pretty lagging, so we're usually a quarter behind to see what kind of share we've gained in Olive Garden and Longhorn. So I really can't really comment on that. I would assume that we've gained share based on based on the industry data. I mean, because we're looking at total industry, so a lot of restaurants were shut down. As far as our boxes, and I think the biggest thing that we're looking at right now and I mentioned this earlier, is that we, believe the off-premise experience will be driven by Curbside enabled by technology. We were on a pathway in our big brands to really developed space that's consumer facing to deal off-premise experience where the consumer came into the building to get it. So now we're looking at that and we're trying to develop ways to adapt the current facilities to make that space non-consumer facing and closer to the kitchen so it should actually cost less longer term as we make these adjustments. We have just built the new prototype in Orlando for all of Garden with a dedicated consumer facing off-premise experienced more like a, what I would call, a fast casual type restaurant/and now we've determined that's not necessary, so that's good news on that [indiscernible]. And so, our team is working real hard to figure out what these adjustments will look like, they will target those investments in the high volume off-premise locations and they'll react and get that done over the next couple of years. Hey, John. Good questions. I think from a technology standpoint, there is nothing we're adding to help our supervision. We've got some \u2013 we got management information systems that we've been well developed over the years, we continue to evolve those, streamline those, try to get them the most important information that they need to run their businesses. I think the biggest challenge there is how to not giving too much information and parallelism and so I think that will be one thing that I think Rick will look at in his new role, especially with his technology background as how to fine tune that platform to ensure that they're getting the information they need, but not too much information. As far as the team member management mix. I don't see any gain, we've always been efficient maybe more efficient than I think a lot of our competitors are at that level. We use key employees to supplement as a supplement to management but also as a development program is a gateway into our management program. So I think we're pretty lean there and I don't see our technology is going to change that at all. I mean I'm always going to want a Management person in the business, in the facility leading, these large groups of people. I think the difference in casual dining and I think it's one of the reasons why it doesn't franchise all that well, these are complex businesses with lots of team members. And if you're not doing this business over the counter. And the one thing that off-premise has added is, added more complexity as you're dealing with 10 or 12 at a time in your parking lot as you bring in the food out. So the businesses in some ways getting more complex as you try to deliver food through different channels. So I don't see a whole lot of cost savings there. Yes, good question, Greg. I think that \u2013 obviously, we shrunk it for many reasons, primarily supply chain and then just from a labor productivity standpoint. We've been very judicious as we brought the products back. We think we've through our turf studies we think that we've satisfied everybody on the \u2013 any consumer and offer them places that they would want to go and eat specific menu. What we're really focused on is, eliminating duplicity in the menu where you have a menu item, it does the same thing someone else did. I think that [indiscernible] has a very broadly appealing menu but yet limited number of items you have to figure out what Hill Stoner or Houston's environment where they touch everything in each category that you might want as a consumer, but they do it with 15 menu items. And so I think that's what we're trying to do is to ensure that we don't have duplicative. And I think the example I would use is, in Longhorn as an appetizer you don't need both wild west shrimp and [indiscernible], it's the same consumer that's going to buy the product. And so what we're working on is, how do we end up with the unique product and a product that you can only get in our restaurant, that's very craveable and that differentiates you. And having two products that do the same thing and one is not \u2013 one is ubiquitous and one is differentiated, it makes no sense to me. And so that's how we're thinking about it. So, over time, yes, [indiscernible] product there, yes. But what you have to have, you have to have discipline. And the discipline is, you have to take stuff off. And we have been demonstrating that as an industry over the last 15 years and we need to demonstrate that moving forward. Yes. We are very strong in that. In Olive Garden already \u2013 obviously, we sell [indiscernible]. So that's a big part of our business. Where we're seeing some growth right now is in Cheddar's with that business with family packs. We've also had some success in our upscale brands being able to sell family packs, stakes and size that you can \u2013 that are \u2013 stakes aren't prepared but the size are prepared and we will give you instructions to reheat. And so we're calling family meals or family packs that are working very well. So I think it's something that we had some penetration. In Olive Garden, I think it will be bigger as we move forward. And it provide us an opportunity in some of our other businesses to get in that business. Yes, I think it's a slight bump from pre-pandemic levels. I think that \u2013 I mean, listen, this was a growing piece of everyone's business has convenient to became more and more important. Maybe there is an opportunity for us to take more share in Olive Garden than I think, because the experience is going to be so frictionless, but we are going to see what the consumer demand is. What I am confident in, especially on the Olive Garden side and somewhat to Cheddar's is that, we will have \u2013 we will get our share in this business, we will get our share of the off-premise pie. And I think we'll do a really good job with it, and it will continue to grow over time. Yes, I'm not a big believer in trying to gain too much efficiency on the service side. I mean I think every time you say you're going to gain efficiency there, you've really saying you're going to cut service. And we are full service restaurant. So when I think about the handhelds and technology for the service, I'm thinking more about speed of service for our guest than saving money. I just \u2013 I've been doing this for a long time and I just \u2013 every time I've tried to increase the efficiency in that part of the restaurant it doesn't end well for me. And so I am committed to keeping the service levels up. I think service is a big part of the value equation, that's a differentiator when you come into our restaurant versus go into a fast casual or fast food is, we got to provide a service. And there is a level that you're going to, you want to get to that minimum level, you want to do a better than your competitors and you want to earn your business that way. So I see the technology solution more as a benefit to the consumer not a benefit to us from a cost standpoint. We're totally rethinking our promotional strategy and how to effectively use that. There was a lot of good in what we did and we've realized there was a lot of bad in what we did. And there's a lot of activity that goes into those. And as we evaluate that after the fact we believe there is a better way to do that. That doesn't mean that we're not going to do LTOs, but we've been out of them \u2013 we were out of LTOs and LongHorn for almost 2 years, pre-pandemic. And we have been able to make that adjustment. As we look at Olive Garden, we will continue to try to figure out what's the best way to use our scale advantage and market that business effectively, but also considering do we need to do six LTOs a year or are there other ways to do that more effectively. Yes, Priya. As we know the dividends are important to our shareholders. We also know that the dividend policy is important to our bondholders. And as you think about our dividend and what we do, we typically set it within our long-term framework of 50% to 60% of our earnings. And the quarter that we just ended was at the low end of that, at 50%. We're going to continue to work with the Board on what our dividend is going forward, but going farther than this quarter, it's kind of hard for me to say, because the board is the one that decides a dividend, but we did contemplate what we think our guidance was in Q3 when we set our dividend in Q2. So we always look forward to see what we think our cash flows are going to be to ensure that the dividend is safe. And so that's why we set the dividend of $0.37 this quarter. Thanks, Priya."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. For the second quarter, total sales were $1.7 billion, a decrease of 19.4%. Same-restaurant sales declined 20.6%, EBITDA was $206 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.74. Our second quarter start was encouraging with weekly sales building on results from the first quarter. However, as COVID-19 cases began increasing in November and many state and local governments re-imposed dining room restrictions, the last two weeks of the quarter trended down significantly. We estimate that this downward shift in sales over the last two weeks negatively impacted operating income by approximately $15 million. Turning to the P&L. Food and beverage expense was 30 basis points higher than last year, primarily driven by investments in food quality and increased to-go packaging. Restaurant labor was 140 basis points lower than last year with hourly labor improving by over 310 basis points, driven by operational simplification. This was partially offset by deleverage and management labor due to sales declines and $3 million of emergency pay net of retention credits as we reinstated our emergency pay program for our team members impacted by dining room closures. Restaurant expense per operating week was 13% lower than last year, driven by lower repairs, maintenance and utilities expenses. However, sales deleverage resulted in restaurant expense as a percent of sales coming in 170 basis points higher than last year. We reduced marketing spend by almost $50 million this quarter with total marketing 210 basis points favorable to last year. Restaurant level EBITDA margin was 17.9%, 140 basis points above last year despite the sales decline of 19%. General and administrative expenses were negatively impacted by $8 million of mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. This is related to significant appreciation in both the Darden share price and equity markets this quarter. As a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, it is mostly offset in the tax line. Page 12 of this quarter's presentation illustrates the $8.1 million reduction of operating income and corresponding operating income margin reduction of 50 basis points from mark-to-market expense. Our hedge reduced income tax expense by $6.4 million, resulting in a net mark-to-market reduction to earnings after-tax this quarter of $1.7 million. The effective tax rate of 8.3% this quarter was lower by 5.1 percentage points due to the tax benefits from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned. After adjusting for this, the normalized effective tax rate for the second quarter would have been 13.4%. Looking at our segment performance this quarter, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and our other segment, all saw a segment profit margin increase despite sales declines. This was driven by our continued focus on simplified operations, which significantly reduced direct labor and lower marketing expenses. Our Fine Dining segment profit margin of 18.8% was impressive, although below last year, driven by a 30% sales decline. We ended the second quarter with $770 million in cash and another $750 million available in our untapped credit facility, giving us over $1.5 billion of available liquidity. We generated over $150 million of free cash flow in the quarter and improved our adjusted debt to adjusted capital to 58% at the end of the quarter, well within our debt covenant of 75%. The board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per share, 50% of our Q2 diluted EPS within our long-term framework for value creation. We will continue to have regular discussions with the board on our future dividends. As I mentioned earlier, the quarter started with sales building upon first quarter results. As dining room closures increased, these improving sales trends reversed. As of today, we have approximately 77% of our restaurants operating with at least partial dining room capacity versus a peak of 97% in the middle of the second quarter. Moving forward, we may experience further dining room closures and increasing capacity restrictions in the third quarter. As you may recall, in our last earnings call, we mentioned that the third quarter is historically our peak seasonal sales quarter, driven by the Christmas, New Year's and Valentine's Day holidays as well as travel time during this time of year. At that time, we also stated that it will be more difficult to increase on-premise average unit volumes if capacity restrictions do not ease. Current dining room closures, capacity restrictions and reductions in travel will exacerbate our same-restaurant sales comparison to last year due to the higher sales \u2013 seasonal sales from last year. Additionally, there are still uncertainties surrounding further capacity limitations and dining room closures and the duration of these impacts. Given all these factors, we are providing a broad range of expectations for the third quarter. We expect total sales to be between 65% and 70% of prior year levels, resulting in total sales of between $1.53 billion and $1.65 billion, EBITDA between $170 million and $210 million and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations between $0.50 and $0.75 on a diluted share base of 132 million shares. With dining rooms closures increasing, we are focusing on our playbook of expense management and off-premise sales. While there is encouraging news on the broad distribution of COVID-19 vaccine in the spring, we currently don't anticipate meaningful sales trend improvements until some time in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Despite the short-term headwinds we faced with sales trends, operational complexity and impacts to our team members, I'm confident we are making the right decisions for the long-term to create a better guest experience and strengthen our business. And consistent with our messaging last quarter, we continue to believe we can achieve 100% of our pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at approximately 90% of pre-COVID sales, while continuing to make appropriate investments in our business. Now with that, I will turn it back to Gene. Well, first of all, thanks everybody for all the kind words. And I want to congratulate Raj as well on his promotion. He has been a real partner to me over these \u2013 over the four and a half, five years that I've been the CFO. And so I appreciate that. What do we needed to capitalize. Gene has been talking a lot about what we're doing to make sure that we invest in our team members, invest in our food. And as the restaurants start to ramp up, we really believe that we're seeing and we've seen growth when those restaurants start to open. We're not going to talk strategically about what we're going to do to capitalize on that. But just know that our business model is so much better that even if we \u2013 as we get our sales to grow, our margins will continue to improve, which gets to the second part of that question that you asked, and the question is flow-through in incremental sales. As we look at what we're doing today, right, today, our variable margins are closer to 50% and before they were closer to 40%. And so we've taken a lot of costs out, but some of those costs will come back in. And as we mentioned, and that would imply about 150 basis points of margin improvement over the long run. But right now, incremental profitability is pretty strong. When we started to see some closures, we started to see that drop. And so as we move forward, we still believe that we're going to get to a 100% of our pre-COVID EBITDA, 90% of pre-COVID sales. We just don't know when we're going to get to the 90% of pre-COVID sales. Yes, Chris. Thanks. The G&A, I'll talk about this quarter that we just ended. And as you saw, we reported about $90 million in G&A. But that would have been closer to $82 million without that mark-to-market expense. And as you recall, at the end of the first quarter call, we talked about the early retirement program that we had, saving us about $25 million to $30 million a year. We're still seeing that and we still believe that we'll keep that as we move forward. But we've also had some savings in G&A because of reduced travel and other things, no general manager conference and those kind of things. Those things will come back. How fast they come back is a question. But we're running about 5% G&A or 5.5% G&A right now, which is remarkable considering our sales where they were \u2013 where they are. As we get back to our pre-COVID sales, we will start seeing G&A come up a little bit, but nowhere near where it was before because of that $25 million to $30 million \u2013 I'm sorry, $25 million to $30 million of savings that we got on early retirement. Yes. No, we've been investing in technology for years. As we continue to work on our technology investments, that will impact the depreciation line amortization line going forward. But we also have some projects that we worked on [indiscernible] would fall off. We're going to continue to invest in technology. Will that help make us more efficient here in the support center? Yes. But a lot of our G&A is out in the field and our directors of operations and our senior vice president of operations and technology will help them be more effective and more efficient, but it won't get us a whole lot of G&A save. But absolutely, the technology investments we're making are more about in restaurant. So that's not a G&A, that's kind of restaurant margin. Hi, John. No, I think you got it a little bit on the G&A front. But as we continue to reopen restaurants, we are getting more efficient at that, right? So if restaurants come back and reopen, we are just getting better at doing that. And as restaurants close, we are getting more \u2013 we are more efficient doing that as well. So we just believe that we have got a business model that's wired pretty well right now and that should show up in our margins in Q3. Hey, Jeff. This is Rick. On the labor front, the hourly labor of 310 basis points favorability this quarter, it was really driven by the fact \u2013 compared to 350 in Q1, it was really driven by the fact that in Q1 we had a much, much more simplified menu in some of these restaurants because some of them were still to go only, some of those restaurants were running with very few hourly employees. And so, as we started ramping up dining rooms, yes, we added some labor, but 40 basis point difference isn't very big when you consider the sales that we added from Q1 to Q2. And the emergency pay isn't \u2013 we don't necessarily put that into our direct labor cost, it's more in the kind of fixed labor, we talk about it. So when we talk about the 310 basis point to the 350 basis points, it does not include emergency pay. Hey, John, this is Rick. I'll go through those questions. So lower marketing is part of the 100 million to 150 million \u2013 100 basis points to 150 basis points. I'm sorry. But most of that is going to be from our labor efficiencies that we've come to play. As sales go back up depending on what the competitive environment looks like we will market. I mean, Olive Garden is a national brand. And one of the benefits of Olive Garden is their scale and their national footprint. So Olive Garden will be on TV nationally, because we think that's a big competitive advantage for us. And so marketing will come back not to the level it was before, but most of our 100 to 150 basis points is going to be on the labor front. As it relates to unit potential, while we're not going to give a number on units, Gene did mention Olive Garden, seeing that we could potentially go into smaller markets because of the business model enhancements that we've made, but other brands are going to fill in markets. I mean, one of the things that Gene mentioned earlier about Cheddar's is, they don't have scale, they really don't have a whole lot of scale in most of the markets there are in either. So we really believe in relative market share and we think Cheddar's has the opportunity, LongHorn has the opportunity, all of our brands have the opportunity to build scale in some markets they are in, while still growing into new markets. And in regards to cannibalization, we haven't given that number in a long time. And most of the cannibalization would be at Olive Garden. And Olive Garden isn't growing that many restaurant, so the cannibalization isn't that impactful for us. And as it relates to the other brands, as we do go into some markets that we already have restaurants in, because we're so, especially for Cheddar's, because we're so disbursed on where we \u2013 where our restaurants are. When we add a new restaurant, yes, we will have some cannibalization, but the business model is so much better now that we believe that is the right thing to do, plus it actually leverages some of the G&A and other things in that market, even our supply chain. So while our restaurant level margins may tick down if we cannibalize, the cost outside the restaurant will get better. Hey, Nicole, this is Rick. As it relates to our guidance and then I'll get into the comp. We aren't assuming that we're contemplating any significant changes in net capacity restriction. So where we are today is where we're going to expect to be through the quarter. Other than those that are already contemplated by officials if there is some new ones coming then \u2013 that we already know about, but we don't know about any new ones coming. Now hopefully those things will ease as the quarter goes on. And so, we do have some \u2013 a little bit of that. I will give you \u2013 I want to give you a couple of data points. So as of Sunday our quarter-to-date on a fiscal basis, which is what you all look at, our comp sales were down about 26%. But if you look at it on a comparable calendar basis, because, remember, we had a 53 week last year and Thanksgiving shifted, we're down 35%, as Gene mentioned, over the first 2 weeks. So our guidance takes all that into account, it takes into account that we think that our sales are going to maybe grow a little bit on a per op week basis or on average unit volume basis, but because we are going up against that high seasonal sales last year our comps will be a little bit more challenged. And so that led to the second part of your question of what are we seeing in comps for restaurants that still have dining rooms open. We're now getting into our seasonal period, so we're getting into that point that we talked about after Q1 and recently mentioned on today's prepared remarks is that, our comps are going to be harder. What I would focus everybody on is our average weekly sales. And if you look at our press release that we shared, we still have average weekly sales growing. Unfortunately not growing as fast as average weekly sales grew last year, which we knew would happen and we highlighted that. So we're focusing more on Q4 next year. We believe we have the business to get us through that and we're really comfortable with the guidance that we gave for Q3, but we're really focusing on getting our business really ready to capitalize on when sales come back. Yes, Brian. The one cost that will continue to go up is repairs and maintenance. As I mentioned, we have dine in's closed, we don't have as much beating of our dining room. So we have \u2013 we'll have R&M start to tick up and it already started to tick up in Q2 as dining rooms reopen it also gives us the time to actually do some of that repair and maintenance while the dining are close. So we will have some of that coming up. Utilities go up as your dining rooms open and you've got more utilities going that way. But again that's all contemplated in everything that we have in our guidance. Yes, Jack, this is Rick. I think if you \u2013 as you think about our long-term framework, we haven't adjusted our long-term framework. So as of now, we still believe we can get to those numbers over the long run. But as we've always said, any one year could be above or below that. And so I would hope that FY'22 would be above that, because of where we were in FY'21, but in FY'21 and we're going to be below it. So in the long run, which is what we talk about to all of our investors and to all of you. We believe we can hit our long-term framework. And I will remind everybody that we've been a public company since 1995. We've never had a 10-year period where our average annual TSR has been below 10%. And even when \u2013 fiscal period. So even last year when we had the worst fourth quarter I think of any industry and of any one at least for us, we still had a 10-year TSR of over 10% on average."

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin. Thank you so much.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Marcella. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden\u2019s CEO; and Rick Cardenas, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company\u2019s press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. We plan to release fiscal 2021 second quarter earnings on December 18, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks about our quarterly performance and business highlights and then Rick will provide more detail on our financial results and share our outlook for the second quarter. As a reminder, all references to the industry benchmark during today's call refer to estimated app track [ph] excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse. During our first fiscal quarter industry same restaurant sales decreased 26%. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene.\nGene Lee: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Given the ever-changing environment we continue to operate in, I am very pleased with what we accomplished during the quarter. We are focused on four key priorities; the health and safety of our team members and guests, in-restaurant execution in a complex operating environment, investing in and deploying technology to improve the guest experience, and transforming our business model. The progress we\u2019ve made in these areas combined with our operating results gave us the confidence to repay the $270 million term loan and reinstate the quarterly dividend. Let me provide more detail on the four priorities. First, health and safety of our team members and guests remains our top priority. Following CDC guidelines and local requirements, our teams continue to practice our enhanced safety protocols, including daily team member health monitoring. We also continue to configure our dining rooms for social distancing to create a safe, welcoming environment while maximizing allowable capacity. A key part of this work is installing booth partitions to enable us to safely increase capacity where permissible. At the end of August, we had completed installation in just over 500 restaurants in our total portfolio. Operating in this environment adds another layer of complexity to an already complex operation, and I am proud of the commitment our teams make every day to keep our guests and each other safe. Second, we are laser focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy to drive restaurant level execution that creates great guest experience, whether that's in our dining rooms, outdoors on our patios or in their homes. But it is not easy. Executing at a high level is more complex today due to COVID-19 restrictions that vary by market. Additionally, the constantly changing mix between on-premise and off-premise plus expanded outdoor dining that is weather dependent, reached unpredictability in sales. This is why the work we continue to do to streamline our menus and improve our processes and procedures is so important. Removing complexity from our operations has allowed our restaurant teams to execute more consistently in this unique environment. Our operators continue to deliver great guest experiences by displaying a high level of flexibility, creativity, and passion everyday, and I am thrilled to see that that reflected in our guest satisfaction metrics. Third, we are continuing to invest in and implement technology to remove friction from the guest experience. This includes providing multiple ways for our guests to order inside and outside the restaurant across our digital storefronts. Additionally, we are deploying mobile solutions to make it easier for our guests to let us know when they have arrived to dine or pick up curbside order-to-go. We are also expanding mobile payment options, providing additional convenience for our guests. For our three largest brands combined, more than 50% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital transactions where guests ordered and paid online. Finally and most importantly, we transformed our business model. Even with the sales declines we are experiencing, our restaurants continue to produce high absolute sales volumes. Therefore, we made the strategic decision to focus on adjusting our cost structure in order to generate strong cash flows, while making the appropriate investments in our businesses. This provides us a stronger foundation for us to build on as sales trends improve. The first step in this process was to re-imagine our offerings. This resulted in simplified menus across the platform driving significant efficiencies in food waste and direct labor productivity. Additionally, due to capacity restrictions, we significantly reduced marketing promotional spending along with other incentives we have historically used to drive sales. We will continue to evaluate our marketing promotional activity as the operating environment evolves. Finally, we have further optimized our support structure which is driving G&A efficiencies. The results of all these efforts to transform our business model can be seen in the fact that we generated adjusted EBITDA of $185 million for the quarter. Turning to our business segments, Olive Garden delivered strong average weekly sales per restaurant of $70,000 while significantly strengthening their business model, resulting in higher segment profit margin than last year. They were able to capitalize on simplification initiatives that strengthened the business model while making additional investments in abundance and value. This work was critical to position Olive Garden to drive future profitable top line sales as capacity restrictions ease. Olive Garden same restaurant sales for the quarter declined 28.2%, 220 basis points below the industry benchmark. Overall, capacity restrictions continue to limit their top line sales, particularly in key high-volume markets like California and New Jersey where diners were closed for the majority of the quarter. In fact, restaurants that had some level of dining capacity for the entire quarter averaged more than $75,000 in weekly sales retaining nearly 80% of their last year's sales. Given the limited capacity environment during the quarter, Olive Garden made a strategic decision to reduce their marketing spend as well as incentives and eliminate their promotional activity. They will continue to evaluate their level of marketing activity as capacity restrictions ease. Additionally, off-premise continued to see strong growth with off-premise sales increasing 123% in the quarter representing 45% of total sales. Thanks to technology investments we continue to make, online sales made up almost 60% of total off-premise sales, more than tripling last year's online sales. Finally, Olive Garden successfully opened three new restaurants in the quarter which are exceeding expectations. LongHorn had a very strong quarter. Same restaurant sales declined 18.1%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 790 basis points. This strong guest loyalty and operational execution helped drive their outperformance, while they also benefited from their geographic footprint. In fact, same-restaurant sales were positive for the quarter in Georgia and Mississippi. Additionally, the LongHorn team made significant investments in food quality and operational simplicity, which led to improved productivity and better execution. They also took a number of steps to improve the overall digital guest experience. Off-premise sales grew by more than 240% representing 28% of total sales. Finally, LongHorn successfully opened two restaurants during the quarter. The brands in our Fine Dining segment are performing better than anticipated. While weekday sales continue to be impacted by reduction in business travel, conventions, and sporting events, we saw strong guest traffic on the weekends, and believe there will be additional demand as capacity restrictions begin to ease. And lastly, our Other Business segment also delivered strong operational improvement with segment profit margin of 12.8%. This was only 130 basis points below last year despite a 39% decline in same restaurant sales. Yard House's footprint in California is impacting same restaurant sales in this segment. Finally, I continue to be impressed by how our team members are responding to take care of our guests and each other. We know our people are our greatest competitive advantage, and I want to thank everyone of our team members. We are succeeding, thanks to your hard work and resilience. Now I'll turn it over to Rick. (Auidt End)\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. The encouraging trends and performance we experienced toward the end of the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Furthermore, the actions we took in response to COVID-19 to solidify our cash position, transform the business model, simplify operations, and strengthen the commitment of our team members, helped build a solid foundation for the future. These actions and our continued focus on pursuing profitable sales have resulted in strong first quarter performance that significantly exceeded our expectations. For the quarter total sales were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 28.4%. Same restaurant sales decreased 29%. Adjusted EBITDA was $185 million and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.56. Turning to the P&L, looking at food and beverage line, favorability from menu simplifications more than offset increased to go packaging costs. However, these inflations of over 7%, primarily impacting LongHorn, drove food and beverage expense 20 basis points higher than last year for the company. Restaurant labor were 20 basis points lower than last year with hourly labor as a percent of sales improving by over 350 basis points, driven by operational simplifications. This was mostly offset by deleverage in management labor. Restaurant expense included $10 million of business interruption insurance proceeds related to COVID-19 claims submitted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding this benefit we reduced restaurant expense per operating week by over 20% this quarter. For marketing we lowered absolute spending by over $40 million bringing marketing as a percent of sales to 1.9%, 130 basis points less than last year. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin was 17.8%, 20 basis points below last year, but particularly strong given the sales decline of 28%. General and administrative expenses were $10 million lower than last year as we effectively reduced expenses and right sized our support structure. Interest was $5 million higher than last year mostly related to the term loan that was outstanding for the majority of the quarter. And finally, our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 9%. All of this culminated in adjusted earnings after tax of $73 million, which exclude $48 million of performance adjusted expenses. These expenses were related to the voluntary early retirement incentive program and corporate restructuring completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Approximately $10 million of this expense is non-cash and the remaining will be cash outflows through Q2 of fiscal 2022. This restructuring resulted in a net 11% reduction in our workforce in the restaurant support center and field operations leadership positions. It is expected to save between $25 million and $30 million annually. We expect to see approximately three quarters of these savings throughout the remainder of fiscal 2021. Looking at our segment performance this quarter, despite a sales decline of 28%, Olive Garden increased segment profit margin by 110 basis points to 22.1%. This strong profitability was driven by simplified operations which reduced food and direct labor costs, as well as reduced marketing spending. LongHorn Steakhouse, Fine Dining and the Other Business segment delivered strong positive segment profit margins of 15.1%, 11.9%, and 12.8% respectively, despite the significant sales decline experienced in the quarter. These brands also benefited from simplified operations keeping segment profit margin at these levels. In the first quarter 68% of our restaurants operated with at least partial dining room capacity for the entire quarter. These restaurants had average weekly sales per restaurant of $69,000 and a same restaurant sales decline of 21.9%. And while Olive Garden and the Fine Dining segment had fewer dining rooms open than our average, these restaurants had the highest average weekly sales per restaurant of almost $76,000 and $90,000 respectively. At the start of the second quarter, we had approximately 91% of our restaurants with dining rooms open operating in at least limited capacity. Now turning to our liquidity and other matters. During the quarter, as we saw steadily improving weekly cash flows we gained confidence in our estimated cash flow ranges. We fully repaid the $270 million term loan took out in April. We ended the first quarter with $655 million in cash and another $750 million available in our untapped credit facility, giving us over $1.4 million of available liquidity. We generated over $160 million of free cash flow in the quarter and improved our adjusted debt to adjusted capital to 59% at the end of the quarter, well within our debt covenant of below 75%. Given our strong liquidity position, improvements in our business model, and better visibility into cash flow projections, our Board reinstituted a quarterly dividend. The board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share. This dividend represents 53% of our first quarter adjusted earnings after tax within our long-term framework for value creation. We will continue to have regular discussions with the Board on our future dividend policy. Our first quarter results were significantly better than we anticipated. The actions we took to simplify menus and operating procedures, and capture other cost savings, along with our choice to pursue profitable sales, have yielded strong results. And now with a full quarter operating under this environment, we have even better visibility into our business model. For the second quarter we expect total sales of approximately 82% of prior year, including approximately 100 basis points of headwind due to the Thanksgiving holiday moving back into the second fiscal quarter this year. We anticipate EBITDA between $200 million and $215 million and diluted net earnings per share between $0.65 and $0.75 on a diluted share base of 131 million shares. In this environment we continue to focus on building absolute sales volumes week-to-week and quarter-to-quarter. This may result in variability and sales comparison to last year as capacity constraints lead to less seasonality than we would have experienced historically. Said another way, if capacity and social distancing restrictions remain similar to where they are today, it will be challenging to dramatically increase our on-premise average in volumes. Our second quarter is typically our lowest averaging in volume quarter and our third quarter is typically our highest. Additionally, as capacity restrictions ease and sales normalize, we will be able to reinvest to drive the top line and a better overall guest experience. One last point before we take your questions. Based on our strong business model enhancements, we now think we can get to pre-COVID EBITDA dollars and approximately 90% of pre-COVID sales while still making appropriate investments in our business. And with that, we will take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Your line is open.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. In the press release, you mentioned on the execution that it was better than expected. I'm curious if you could just kind of dig in a little bit there more specifically either by brand or by cost bucket? And subsequently, how sustainable are some of the cost improvements if you could maybe give a sense for how much better you think margins could be if you were to get back to say 100% of the prior sales?\nGene Lee: I'll take the execution part, and I'll let Rick talk about the margin piece. I think a lot of our execution is coming from the streamlined menus. And our ability to put out products with increased frequency of that product is helping our execution and our team members are becoming much better at doing that. When you limit your menu and you focus on key products, the quality of that product just continues to go up. And I also think it transcends itself into the dining rooms. And I think today, we've gotten used to the complexity of operating with the COVID requirements, and every day I think we're running better and better restaurants. Rick, do you want to talk about the margins?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, hey Andrew. I'm going to start with the 90% number that we gave a second ago. We have made improvements in our cost structure as Gene has mentioned and significantly improved our business model. As sales improve, remember we assume that some of these costs will come back, but not all of them. The 90% contemplates some costs returning along with continued reinvestments. And while the 90% sales level may change depending on the competitive environment and the economic backdrop, now I will say that if we get to 100% and we make some investments as we've been talking about, we could see margins improve by 100 basis points, maybe even 150, but again that depends on the economic backdrop, the competitive environment, and what do we have to do to get to that 100%. So, I wouldn't tie in the 100% to 150%, but I would at least get into the 90% based on our EBITDA, I'm sorry getting our EBITDA back based on 90% of sales.\nAndrew Strelzik: Okay, great. And if I could just squeeze one more in, I'm just curious if you think you've seen at all any impact from stimulus tapering off, if you've seen that or any other kind of regional or daypart differences that you have also seen if you can comment on that it would be great? Thanks.\nGene Lee: No, we've seen no falloff with the stimulus. Actually, we're seeing average weekly sales across the system improve every single week. So, we're feeling pretty good about that. So, we\u2019re seeing some restrictions be eased throughout the country, so really nothing from a regionality standpoint. I think you've just got to look at the mobility index and you've got to follow what's happening with restrictions, and you can see guest traffic move along with that.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAndrew Barish: Yes, hey guys, just wondering on the kind of comments on on-premise dining and sort of driving same-store sales performance from here. What would it take to from a capacity constraint perspective help that number? Can you do more booth partitions and just the impact of seasonality starting with the outdoor patio business as well, just trying to find a level set on all those areas?\nGene Lee: Let me work backwards to your question, outdoor capacity is really de minimis for us overall as the system. The good news is that we haven\u2019t really been able to use a lot of our outdoor capacity in Florida, it has been raining every single day here for the last six weeks. So we're going to start getting that back. As we lose outdoor capacity up north, we will pick up a lot more in Florida than we've been able to use. So, for that when we think about outdoor capacity, it is really not that meaningful for us. As far as what's going to drive in the short term, some more same restaurant sales is additional capacity. We need to get California back. We need some other areas to increase their capacity from 25% to 50%. Once you get past 50% as long as the six-foot rule is in place, you still are not going to really be able to max out your dining rooms. In some areas we're getting our bar tops back which are important, gives us more capacity inside the restaurant. And so, I think it really comes down to just the incremental improvements in the capacity levels. We're going to probably continue to roll out booth partitions, we\u2019ll probably close to double what we have right now and that gives us six to seven extra tables per restaurant in the jurisdictions that allow us to do that, and not every jurisdiction allows us to do that. I think that our teams are being very respectful of the requirements in their operating environment, and we're trying to create first and foremost a safe environment for our team members and our guests, and we're not trying to push same restaurant sales and risk that experience for our team members and guests. So, I would look at getting California back is big in Olive Garden. We've got 100 restaurants there.\nAndrew Barish: Okay, and just a quick followup for Rick if you could. I mean the same-store sales and the total sales gap in the 1Q were basically on top of each other. The 18% reduction in total sales, is there a same-store sales analog for the 2Q we can kind of point to in terms of a gap?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, it is pretty close. It is not like we have a lot of new restaurants coming into play, so it is within a 100 basis points.\nAndrew Barish: Okay, thank you very much.\nKevin Kalicak: Marcella, we are ready for our next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nNicole Miller Regan: Thank you and good morning. When I look back to Slide 16 of the presentation, can you speak to the capacity in the first quarter? What was the average and was it higher or lower as you exit the quarter because that can help us kind of inform and understand the capacity in 2Q? I know 90%, 91% are open, but I am wondering what kind of capacity mandates or restrictions you are dealing with?\nGene Lee: Well, most of the capacity restrictions are around the 50% range, 50% capacity, some are 100% but if you average out our company, when you take the six foot rule, et cetera, we're probably at the 50% capacity range even at the end of the quarter.\nNicole Miller Regan: Okay, okay, super. And then it is not lost on us when you talk about the back to basics and I think there is obviously no one better than your team efforts and it is a power to teams. So if you think about roles and the functions for me like six feet office rule comes to mind. How are you really resourcing your team to be effective right now? Can you give us some concrete examples?\nGene Lee: I think our engagement with our team members goes all the way back to the beginning of COVID, I mean it actually goes beyond that, but I think how we held the situation with emergency pay and taking care and thinking of our people and staying engaged with them and paying their benefits. We invested over $100 million in that short period of time into our team members. So bringing them back to work has been fairly easy for us. And I think our team members are really engaged in what they are doing. And so, and we've got this strong culture for a long time. And our team member retention is better than ever which is really exciting to see. I mean I'm looking at retention numbers for our team members that I'd never thought I would see in this industry. I've been working in this industry for over 30 years. I've never seen retention like this which gives us the ability to execute it at the highest level. And as we bring people back to work or bring them back, our most productive and our most dedicated team members. So I think the spirit is high in our restaurant. I think people are excited to be out there, they're making money. I think they're bringing happiness to people that come into our restaurants and I think that energy is \u2013 in this very difficult time in transferring between the guest and the team member, and I'm in the restaurants every day, and I'm in one of our restaurants most every day, sometimes twice a day. I would tell you that, the attitude is just absolutely fantastic and our team members are doing a great job.\nNicole Miller Regan: Thanks, I appreciate the commentary.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian your line is open.\nBrian Bittner: Sorry, I was on mute. Good morning guys. When you talk about getting back to pre-COVID EBITDA levels on 90% of sales, can you just talk about your working assumption on that relative to G&A versus pre-COVID in restaurant level profits versus pre-COVID?\nGene Lee: Well, Brian, I think on the G&A side, we talked about the voluntary emergency, I'm sorry voluntary early retirement program, and that's going to save us $25 million to $30 million a year on a rolling basis. And we would we would expect G&A to start coming back up as we start getting travel et cetera. We didn't do a whole lot of travel in the first quarter, but most of our investments will be back in the restaurant as you think about marketing spend and labor and other things. So I would say that if you look at what we say in the 90% range, most of our investment will be back in the restaurant. Our G&A, we would hope, our G&A would be at least below 5% for the foreseeable future.\nBrian Bittner: Okay. And would you describe all of the LongHorn's outperformance relative to Olive Garden, is that all due to geographical mix in the six feet rule, or is there anything else that you'd point out as it relates to LongHorn's performance relative to Olive Garden?\nGene Lee: I think the majority of it is geographic and I think the brand strength in Georgia has been incredibly impressive. And I think that it's just a market where there's a lot of loyalty to the brand. I think the market, Georgia, State of Georgia trusts LongHorn and I think people are going to where they're really comfortable. And so I do think that their consumer maybe a little bit better off economically. But I mean, their performance is impressive without a doubt, but it's being driven by Georgia, I mean it is being driven a lot by their footprint.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks Gene, and my last question just with Olive Garden, we talked a lot last earnings call about the capacity restraints related to the six feet rule. Is there anything else if we stay in this environment for a while moving forward, is there anything you are doing to improve the capacity based on the seating configuration within that six feet rule that we should know about?\nGene Lee: Well, I think we can see that temporary barriers, I think, the team continues to look at how do you, can you move a few tables in the dining room to improve the overall capacity. So I think they continue to try to modify that. I think the thing when you think about Olive Garden is focused on the absolute volumes. You know it is $75,000 a week, these are these are healthy, healthy businesses. And the off-premise business continues to thrive, which is a place that we're going to. We start putting some marketing money back into that business. It will be focused on trying to drive off-premise not in-premise. We continue to evaluate what's the best way to go with that investment spend, when is the right time to use it? And so, the other thing I would tell you is that, it can probably be hard for you to believe, but we have one restaurant that cost us 50 basis points in comps. That's the Times Square Olive Garden and we start every single week $300,000 in the hole from a comp store basis. We are going to get 25% capacity back in Times Square on the 30th, but that's -- you wake up every day and you are $300,000 short just in that one restaurant. That's our best restaurant in the Olive Garden system. We do $50 million there, and now we're doing, $2500 a day. And so, we've got some odd ball things. Getting California back is going to be huge. California is a big market for us with high volumes. We have a higher check average and we can see because we're starting to get some counties back, and we can see the impact on that on a daily weekly basis.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks Gene.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Co. Your line is open.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thanks. Question for Rick and a question for Gene. Rick the sales levels in labor line was quite impressive during the quarter. I was curious how would you categorize what you view as permanent savings from the shift to online pickup and more streamlined kitchen operations and efficiencies versus maybe some of the temporary improvements that will persist in 2Q from volumes that are below peak? And then, Gene, you kind of talked a little about it, just did it head on, the hundred partitions that were implemented last quarter to improve seating capacity, I think you said you doubled it, but curious, what has been the learnings there? How would that help? Is that a key unlock for you in terms of where we are in this -- in the reopening, or is that just something that's just a small tool? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Okay Andrew. On the labor line, remember we've got two components of labor, one is the hourly labor, which is where we saw a lot of efficiencies, and the other one is the management labor, which is more fixed in nature. We would expect the hourly labor to not be as favorable going forward, just because of training expenses. We didn't have as much training in the first quarter, and we'll continue to, we're going to start having some training in Q2 and beyond. But as our sales pick up, our management labor should be leveraged a little bit more than it was before. So, I think there was a question earlier on whether it get to at 100%, and that 100 and 150 basis point improvement will mostly come out of labor and some cost of sales.\nRick Cardenas: Yes Andrew, on the partitions, depending on the restaurant foot layout, you're going to get six to eight more tables, and you know most of those will be four tops and the average party is 2.3. So I mean, I wouldn't say it's not de minimis, but sounds meaningful. I mean, you're getting, especially on the weekends you're getting another two seatings on those tables. So every little bit helps, because we have the demand for those tables, but it's not going to it's not going to move the top-line significantly.\nAndrew Charles: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks, good morning. Just on the promotional schedule, I think that I think we're all sad to see that may be never any possible is not being run this year and I'm just curious. You know what needs to happen from a capacity standpoint, restriction standpoint for that promotion to make sense, and there are limited that whether it be 25%, 50%, or 75% worth of diners reopened where it makes sense to have traffic driving promotions at that one. And then like later in the year is that a lever that you can pull and bring it back to drive people to the restaurants?\nGene Lee: Yes, I think on those high volume, high traffic promotions, we're going to feel, we have to feel comfortable that we got pretty much 100% capacity unless the promotion, we are speaking about promotions that drive the off-premise and drive off-promise experience. When I think about marketing, and the team thinks about marketing, I think that we want to try to get far along as we possibly can through this crisis or cycle, and then fully understand what the competitive set is going to be, what the economic backdrop is going to be, and then we'll figure out how to appropriately layer back in all our promotional, marketing and promotional activity and our incentives. We think we can layer those back in smarter and more effective than we had them in the system before, and this is a terrible thing that we're going through, but we're trying to find, okay we're trying to find the positives in this to really rethink, and rethink how we go to market with our businesses. And this is fortunately once in a lifetime option to be able to do things that we probably couldn't do, where we were pre-COVID. So you know, I think long term, we're going to look at the situation and we'll decide when we layer in our best promotional options, and we may have to re-imagine and revisit some of those promotional options to our guests so that we can maybe do it at a higher margin rate, but we have lots of questions and a lot of work to do around that.\nEric Gonzalez: That's really helpful. And then you mentioned in your remarks earlier that the off-premise mix was a moving target. Can you really dig into that a little bit more, and talk about what sort of the cannibalization rate looks like as dining was reopened, or maybe what happens when restrictions are put back in place?\nGene Lee: There's nothing concrete there, because each market is behaving differently. And so, when you see restrictions change, and maybe your capacity goes from 25 to 50 in certain markets that volume just switches from off-premise to on-premise, in other markets it doesn't. It depends on what's happening. We believe there's a good percentage of our off-premise today is being generated by people coming to the restaurant that can't get in, because the wait is too long, and there's no place to wait inside our restaurants. And so we think that those people have a tendency to just opt into the off-premise experience. So we really can't quantify that for you, because every market is different.\nEric Gonzalez: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird, your line is open.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. I have two questions. First, on the second quarter guidance, I just wanted to clarify, the guidance on the top line, is that similar to how you're running quarter-to-date or are you expecting to see further improvement as states like California start to open up?\nRick Cardenas: Yes David, our guidance first for sales for Q2, remember it incorporates a 100 basis point headwind for Thanksgiving. So we are running a little bit better than that quarter-to-date, but not by much. And so we do anticipate an increase of about 10% of average weekly sales from quarter one. It doesn't contemplate any significant change in capacity restrictions, other than the ones that we already know, other than the ones that have already been approved. But it also doesn't contemplate any significant change in sales due to a second wave or a vaccine approval. So that we thought 82% was fairly prudent, it's slightly low where we are running today, but it does take into effect the 100 basis point swing from Thanksgiving.\nDavid Tarantino: Great, thank you for that. And then Gene, I was wondering, just philosophically how you think about what Darden might look like as we exit the pandemic, and I guess what I'm specifically wondering is, is it your goal to drive the sales volumes back to 100% of where you were before the pandemic or do you think you'd take less sales with a better simpler operating model that's easier to execute?\nGene Lee: I would take, I want both, I want a simple operating model, and I want higher sales, and I think that we're setting up for that, because I think there's a few dynamics that are in our favor. Number one, there's definitely been a capacity, there'll be capacity coming out of the system and we believe that we're well positioned to take share. And we think that this simplified operations will help us improve execution we will get better throughput and so we think there's a pathway to both, higher sales and better margins. I think our teams have done an incredible job of reimagining almost every aspect of their business through this. And I see a pathway to get there. I think Rick is bringing you back to the 90% only as a way to communicate where we think margins are going to be at a future sales level. We're not setting a target saying that we'd be happy with that. We see a pathway for our sales to get above that and we see a pathway for our margins to be above pre-COVID levels at that time.\nDavid Tarantino: That's helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJeff Bernstein: Great, thank you very much. One followup and then a separate question, the follow up just on the comments you made a moment ago regarding your guidance for fiscal 2Q does not assume any second wave of re-infection. I'm just wondering, as you think about it in the short term, what are you seeing with comps in markets where there are spikes in infection rates, whether you see a step back or whether you see capacity pullback? I'm trying to get a sense for the worst case scenario if we were to see a second spike in terms of what you're seeing thus far, or what learnings you've had? And then I had one follow up.\nGene Lee: So, as you know so far Jeff, we have seen no change in demand based on COVID levels in a market, unless capacity restrictions change. So, if you're example we're in South Florida, when we had the spike after the 4th of July, and the restaurant restrictions were very limited, we definitely saw demand drop, but that was not because of the consumer, it was more because of the restrictions the local municipalities put on us. We see a pretty resilient consumer out there. I know that's hard for you guys in New York to imagine, but the rest of the country is not operating that way. And so, I would tell you that what we're seeing is, it's all being controlled by the local municipalities, that they're managing demand more than the consumer.\nJeff Bernstein: Interesting. And then the other question was just on the, I think you alluded to it earlier in terms of what the industry is going to look like and capacity going forward. So I'm just wondering I just think about the independents and the crisis, we are all going through, but what are you seeing thus far in terms of, I guess you'd call it permanent closures or the impact you see for the industry going forward maybe the supply demand imbalance, or whether it's real estate availability, or market share opportunity, just trying to get a bigger picture thought on what you're seeing thus far for the outlook for primarily the independents?\nGene Lee: Well, I think the independents obviously have a tough time right, and as we think about it we think somewhere between 5% and 15% of capacity will come out of the system during this, maybe a little bit more but a lot of people will get recapitalized quickly and get some of these boxes back open. Obviously that that's going to benefit us in the short term and in the long term. As far as real estate so far has been one of the things that, my hypothesis has been, I've been a little bit off on. We've yet to see a meaningful change and what we can acquire real estate, I thought that being one of the only bidders out there, that we would see the costs come down. I think we're still going through the price discovery process on that and we'll see how that plays out long term. I've got to believe that we will benefit from availability and hopefully price. Availability is already there. It's just trying to get through what we think the property's worth versus what the REIT or the landlord thinks the property is worth. And so that will have some impact and help us grow, get to our 2% to 3% new unit growth over time.\nJeff Bernstein: Thanks Gene, I appreciate the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJohn Glass: Thank you and good morning. One of the biggest -- two of the biggest shifts I guess during COVID right has been this growth in the off-premise business across the industry, and second has just been the pickup and delivery, not delivery, but the digital business overall. So can you first just talk about the off-premise business? How do you think you need to, or do you need to change the format of the restaurant, or some other sort of structural change that you think that can facilitate a better off-premise experience or is what you're doing kind of working and the operational changes are working or do you think there's more sort of either pickup windows or some other permanent changes to the way the restaurants are structured to facilitate that?\nGene Lee: That's a good question John. I think that, going into this that we did the majority of our pickup with someone coming into the restaurant and picking up the food. We set up our process, because we believed and we proved out that accuracy and on time were the two most important things that the off-premise consumer wanted. Through this we had to go to a different experience which was when we moved very, very quickly to curbside. And we what we've learned through this is that curbside is a better option, and that the burden of on time and accurate needs to get on us and we need to have better systems to be able to deliver the same level of accuracy that we were delivering in pre-COVID. And what that means is, in one of our restaurants we are on a path to build better capabilities to handle the in-restaurant pick up. And now, as we pivoted to curbside the capabilities that we need to build inside are different. The good news is that they're cheaper because they're really not consumer facing. And so it will cost us a little bit less to be able to create those capabilities. But technology and when the expectation of the consumer is for a curbside experience. And when the expectation of the consumer is for a curbside experience, and we've taken a lot of friction out of that experience over the last 12 weeks, and we're in the middle of really rolling out some technology today to really make that experience a whole lot better. As just about notification when you're in our parking lot, versus we had a very manual procedure that we had to implement in the beginning of this. And eventually, we'll get the geofencing, and we'll catch up to what some of the bigger retail retailers are doing. So we actually think that there's a big benefit in this consumer shift, because we're going to take all these people that were in our dining room -- in our front door, picking up food, and they'll never enter our business -- building again, which makes it a better experience for our dining guests. So that's really the big change, John that for that has to happen. And right now we have the benefit of some of our -- have any extra space inside our restaurant that enables us to stage some of this off-premise work. But as we gain more capacity, we will need to modify some spaces. And actually add some like in a long home we'll have to bump out of the side of the building to be able to handle this extra demand. But I see it as all positive. We think, we can do curbside much more cost effectively than we can do picking up the food inside the restaurant.\nJohn Glass: Thanks for that. And then just thinking of in a second read on digital. So you've got a significant amount of growth in the digital business, particularly on the To Go business. What have you learned from that? Is this -- is this a gate -- are these different consumers for example? Do you think about now your promotional mark \u2013 your marketing spend differently because digital has just grown so significantly as a channel. And I am also curious to hear just your view on other brands have decided to use digital in various ways through delivery as a way to expand the restaurant into other brands, adding products, adding new brands, that specific to a category that doesn't relate to their existing brand. Is that a viable path for Darden?\nGene Lee: So there's two questions in there John, and I'll get to the virtual brand in a second. The first question is, obviously the data is richer when we're capturing the data from our digital guest, which feeds into our huge database on our ability to market to them. So we can figure out to that, and through our tokens that these are, these are dying, our off-premise guests only. Then we can tell all our marketing towards that guest and towards that experience. We understand what they are buying, and what they want to buy. And so we can get smarter with that. We're pretty smart. Prior to this, we just have more information today, and we'll be able to -- our data scientists will be able to use that and market effectively. Let me just pivot to virtual brands, I'm shocked that it took this long to come up. But only give you my take my take on this. Everybody around the room is very nervous right now. But, I think people are in different places, and they're trying to approach this and deal with this moment in time differently. For us, this is not the right approach, we want to focus on brands that we've got 20 plus years and hundreds of millions of dollars invested in trying to build, and we want to make sure that they're executing at a high level. I think brands are going to matter. And I don't think you can -- I think brands are developed over a long period of time, around delivering a promise to a consistent promise to a consumer. I think you have to have a functional need and emotional need. And I think that's what I think that's what our brand builders have done for decades. And to get out on a digital platform and try to do that, I think people got to try to do what they want to do. I'm not -- I'm not saying it's a good idea or a bad idea. It's not for us. Brands are going to matter, and we think it's a distraction.\nJohn Glass: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is open.\nDennis Geiger: Great, thanks. Gene, wondering if you could talk about where sort of customer satisfaction scores are at the moment, I think you might have alluded to it earlier, but kind of just based on some of the technology, the other friction reducing initiatives and maybe some of the other customer experience investments that you spoke to, if you if you're getting credit for that, if you've seen a notable increase there and kind of to some extent, how that's driving some of some of your go-forward thoughts on, on share gains, etcetera. That\u2019s question one.\nGene Lee: I'll be very, very clear. Our guest satisfaction scores are improving dramatically. I want to -- I want to put some context around that, which is, what we don't understand is, is it just the consumer expectations are maybe different to this experience. So we're happy directionally where they're going. And we're happy directly where they're going compared to our competitors. But at the same time, we will -- we were not, patting ourselves on the back too much, because this is definitely a different environment and the consumer feedback is there is different. So we don't know what the expectations are, but we are very pleased directionally where we're heading with our own internal and in some of the industry stuff that we're seeing and how we're comparing to competitors.\nDennis Geiger: Got it. And just kind of as a follow up to that, no, it's not the biggest needle mover right now. But just as it relates to, to Cheddar\u2019s and kind of any improvements that you've been able to make in this environment, and whether that's resonating, just curious if you could, if you could speak to that at all and more broadly if the current environment at all has and emerging from the current environment and your thoughts there, if that changes at all, how you're thinking about future M&A strategy in anyway, if you're able to speak to that? Thank you.\nGene Lee: You guys are getting really good at getting multiple questions in one question. Let's talk about Cheddar\u2019s first, and I'll come back to thoughts on M&A. Cheddar\u2019s is from a business model standpoint, Cheddar\u2019s has had the biggest transformation. The work that John Wilkerson and his team have done, it's been transformative. And I couldn't be more excited about directionally where they're heading. Tactically, one of the biggest changes, and one of the one of the things that we had to really speed up was off-premise capabilities. We had very -- we had very, limited capabilities going to COVID. We only had two phone lines going into most of our restaurants. We couldn't -- we couldn't even take the demand over the phone. We didn't have online ordering. So the team rallied and this was supposed to be an initiative that was going to go all the way through fiscal 2021, really wasn't supposed to be fully operational at 2022. They got together and they've been able to real quickly upgraded their phone lines, they have four phone lines coming in and we now have online ordering, new packaging\u2019s being rolled out as we're speaking. And they developed a native app that actually getting some pretty good adoption. And so that piece of it is been really exciting that they've been able to move as quickly as they possibly can. Their in-restaurant dining is held strong, they still don't have a huge robust off-premise business, but we need to build that. It wasn't something that people thought of Cheddar\u2019s for, but we think there's a big opportunity there. So, I'm thrilled directionally with what they're doing and the transformation they have made in their business model. Just briefly on M&A, there's nothing new to report here. We continue to evaluate opportunities and discuss with our board. We are very happy with our current portfolio. And we believe, that we can achieve our growth targets and our value creation metrics with the portfolio that we have. We believe there is a great opportunity for all our brands.\nDennis Geiger: Thanks, Gene.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Carroll from RBC. Your line is open.\nChristopher Carroll: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. So I just wanted to circle back to margins, and specifically an Olive Garden. So the margins at Olive Garden were particularly impressive this quarter despite the sales decline. So how are you thinking about the margins for that brand longer term? Obviously, as a marketing and potential reinvestment spend builds, that will create drag, but how much of the savings that you found, do you think you can hold on to?\nRick Cardenas: Chris, as we mentioned, Olive Garden segment profit margin was 100 basis points better than last year? We've got a pretty good improvement in cost of sales, partly because of the question that was asked earlier about; about never any possible that actually drags a little bit margin for us. So cost of sales a little bit better. We improved our food waste significantly because of the operational changes that we've made. That said, a 22% margin on the sales levels they have. We're going to start reinvesting eventually. We've got marketing that was down about $20 million year-over-year for Olive Garden. And as capacity starts to come back online as Gene mentioned, we will look at our promotional cadence and our marketing cadence. But 22% is a pretty strong margin. So I wouldn't anticipate us significantly getting better than that, as we continue to reinvest to get back to a point of getting back over 100% of our sales. Our goal is to drive our sales profitably and we have enough room to invest to drive those sales profitably.\nChristopher Carroll: Thanks. And then Rick, in the estimate of recapturing pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at 90% of pre-COVID sales, how does off-premise versus on-premise mix factor into that estimate? Does that contemplate higher off-premise next versus pre-COVID levels?\nRick Cardenas: It does contemplate higher off-premise missed and pre-COVID, but not significantly higher. I mean, as Gene mentioned, Cheddar\u2019s should be higher. Olive Garden should be higher, and LongHorn should be higher. But we're not going to be at 40% or 50% of sales premise when we've got full capacity dining rooms. As you -- as we open as Gene mentioned, as you -- as we open dining rooms, we start seeing that To Go business shift back into in restaurant, but we still are right now we're still retaining 60% of our peak premise sales.\nChristopher Carroll: Got it? Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore. Your line is open.\nDavid Palmer: Hi, good morning, how much? How much higher do you think To Go sales might be at your big two brands after the COVID crisis? And I'm wondering if you have any clues that you care to share in terms of informing that thinking such as these To Go sales being new customers? Or perhaps how that that off-premise mix fades, and they reopen states as your on-premise rebuilds. And I have a follow up.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, David I might. And I've got no empirical evidence to support this. But my theory is that off -- once we open up the dining and say we get back to a normal environment, where we have concerts and revise going to football games and -- I actually think off-premise will dip down below where it was. I think there's going to be a huge surge for on-premise dining. I think people are tired of this experience. They are utilizing this experience right now. But when I talk to people, and we did some research, people want to get back out socialized. I do think, then it comes back, it comes back higher than where we were. I think our thought processes, it's a little bit higher, but not terribly higher, and it will continue to grow over time as it has been. But I don't think that this is some big change that we're going to wake up in Olive Garden and be doing 35% off-premise, if we're going to concerts and having football games.\nDavid Palmer: Wow, that's interesting take. I wonder just on the -- on and how you communicate with consumers. You've obviously made a lot more connectivity with digitally with those consumers. Are you going to advertise less on TV after this is all over? Is this a source of margin leverage for you going forward?\nGene Lee: I think that we have to go back and go back to what I\u2019d said earlier. We have to understand what the competitive set is. We have to understand what the economic backdrop is. We'll have to analyze how well we can get to our consumer through television. We still believe that we can do that. We participate and we\u2019re still participating in the upfront. We think it's a good mechanism for us. And that's part of our skill benefit with Olive Garden. Right? We can advertise on a national platform. And we have some -- we have some efficiencies. And I think that we will still use that in the near term. But it will all depend on what the competitive set is and the economic backdrop. If we pull enough restaurants out, we may not have to advertise for a while.\nDavid Palmer: Yes. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris O\u2019Cull from Stifel. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, guys. Good morning. This is Patrick [ph] on for Chris. I know you spoke briefly, briefly to lapping seasonal increases that really begin after this coming quarter. But I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on just your base case thinking currently on how that plays out and what you're expecting to see based on customer behaviour that you see today. And the capacity constraints that are in place and what levers do you think you can pull if you do see a much more muted seasonality and average weekly sales as you move into the back half of the year. And then I had one follow up.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Patrick. I'll start with -- we've shown week-to-week, we're continuing to build our average weekly sales. And as I mentioned earlier, Q2 is our lowest seasonal quarter and Q3 is our highest, so it does take a lot of increase in average weekly sales to get to the same comp level Q3 as Q2. But what we are going to do and what we continue to do is evaluate the situation. As restaurants open, as dining room capacity is open. I mean as Gene mentioned, if dining room capacity don't continue to expand, we still have some levers to pull in the off-premise side. So that's what we will do, we will continue to advertise off-premise if it's what we need to do to continue to build sales. But as long as we do that profitably, our intention is to grow our sales profitably from where we are today. And so that's what we'll do. We'll continue to focus on off-premise. Now, if dining rooms can reopen completely, we should see an increase in sales.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's helpful. Thanks. And forgive me if I missed this, but it sounds like menu simplification is, it sounded relatively permanent. And so I was wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on exactly, the margin improvement you're seeing from that initiative in particular? And then how do we think about, as sales normalize moving, moving forward a little farther into the future, should we expect to see some adding back to the menu and some additional complexity come back on? Or is this something you're thinking of is completely permanent, even as sales normalized? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Well, the biggest driver of the cost savings is waste. And that in that the touch Menu that's lacking promotional activity, there's some other things that are influencing that. I think that the challenge for the teams is if they need to add menu items, to fulfil a need, can they do that without adding complexity? I think they have to. I think, in their calculus prior to this, there wasn't enough weight put on the complexity of adding new menu items. So it wasn't enough. No one thought about that. I think today, that's part of the -- the part of the thought process is they think about adding something. How do we do this and make sure we maintain our productivity and don't increase our waste? So I think a better way to say that is, as we do menu developments, it\u2019s going through a better filter today, that I think will have a long longer -- have a long lasting impact on our ability to maintain these cost savings.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open.\nPeter Saleh: Great, thank you. Gene, can you just elaborate a little bit on where the cost savings are coming from for doing curbside versus in-store pickup? Is it cheaper labor? Or is it just less spent on CapEx in the store to build out the area for pickup, just trying to understand where the cost savings may be coming from?\nGene Lee: Well, it's a technology that's creating it. It's no one, no one taken the answer on the phone. We're dropping, you know, the consumers letting us know whether when they're in the parking lot, and we're just dropping the bag in their car. So there's just a lot less, interaction there. Just think just, the cost is just purely productivity efficiency. Thinking about a line of five or six people at a desk, or at the bar top in a restaurant waiting to get To Go versus having someone just pull up to a car and put a bag in the trunk. That's where the efficiencies come and technology is enabling all that.\nPeter Saleh: Understood. Okay, and then just on fine -- on the fine dining segment. I think this quarter, you guys mentioned that the weekend, you saw strength, I think that was also similar to what you saw last quarter. Are you seeing any sort of change in consumer behaviour, in fine dining during the week? Or is it more of the same?\nGene Lee: Well I think that, obviously we're missing the business travel and those types of dinners. So I mean, that was a big part of capital grow, and especially in your central business districts, you're always soft, and you're suburbia restaurant, during the week and you made up for on the weekends. I think we -- just another interesting titbit is that, look at capital growth comps, you're starting every week with over a million dollar shortfall just in the three restaurants in New York. We're doing 3000 bucks a day there with our 10 seats. Those restaurants do well over a million, a million dollars a week. And so, you just get this, just so much geographical differences in those businesses. We have some capital growth that\u2019s performing fairly well, especially in suburbia. But I'm confident as I see the sales volume on the weekends. I know we're turning away a lot of people and I know as soon as we can get a few more tables, we can continue to grow that business. And I'm confident that they're confident those businesses are going to be cash flow positive going forward.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.\nJeff Farmer: Great. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions very quickly. So what level of sales from sales performance are you seeing in California? And if you don't want to get that specific, I'm just curious potentially what the headwind for Olive Garden consolidated, same store sales are related to the California partial closures?\nRick Cardenas: Yes Jeff, for the quarter, we were down somewhere around 50% in California. Now remember, they were open for a little bit of time, and then they re-shut down. But we are seeing some pretty good unit volumes in California. And I was talking to Olive Garden more than more than any other brand. But and as Gene mentioned, Yard House is significantly impacted in California. But we were down. And if you take California out of Olive Garden, it's a 200 basis point swing for the quarter.\nJeff Farmer: Okay. And then as a follow up, I think this was touched on earlier, but I asked you this in late June, and I believe you guys said there are about 10 to 15 restaurants that were posting positive, same store sales, even with that 50% capacity, restrict constraint in place, or limit in place. Where does that number stand now?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, I would, what I would say is, instead of getting an individual restaurants; let's talk about a couple of states. I mean, Longhorn was positive in Georgia. The entire system was positive in Georgia for the quarter. We have a lot more restaurants that are positive now than we did going earlier. The last couple of weeks, it's been even better than that. So without getting an individual restaurants, we have it all contemplated in our guidance for Q2. And so I'd rather leave it at that.\nJeff Farmer: Fine, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy from MKM Partners. Your line is open.\nBrett Levy: Thank you. Good morning, thanks for taking the call. When you think about the great job you're doing right now, in terms of managing the hourly labor. When you think about labor, just overall, what are you seeing in terms of inflation, your ability to hire, and also -- the integration of all of the different tests you've talked about? On the technology front, you've spent a lot of time talking about the customer facing, but what about on the operational side? And then just the managing of how you're balancing the in-store and the off-premise? Is it the same servers? Is it the other Front of House, you've heard, you've had one of your competitors talked about how the off-premise transaction is an hourly as opposed to attempt. So I'll stop there for now.\nRick Cardenas: Well Brett, you got a lot in there \u2013 in that person. You got more, I can't wait. But let's talk about hiring. Hiring is very local. There are different pockets of the country that are more stressed than others. I will make a global comment, say I've been amazed at how, how well the hospitality workforce was absorbed into other areas during COVID. And so there hasn't been like, this still, there's still stress in that environment. We're still seeing, we still expect wages to rise somewhere between 3% and 5% for the year. As far as technology, technology goes, and the adaptation is so -- is easy today, right? And then we're doing that we haven't done it. We haven't focused a lot on improving technology in restaurant all of our stuffs really been, all of our efforts been focused on the consumer right now. We do have some -- we will get back to some projects that will modernize some of our tools in restaurant that'll hopefully help increase productivity. And as far as off-premise and we're using for off-premise for us are tipped employees. For more, they've got a higher average weight, but they do collect some gratuities on their service.\nBrett Levy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. A follow up on your commentary regarding industry closures. Are you seeing any noticeable difference? Or do you expect to see any difference in the level of closures in states that reopened earlier? Or maybe urban versus suburban markets? And how has that been forming your future development pipeline?\nRick Cardenas: Well, I think that the markets that have had the tightest restrictions are going to have the most closures. Because I think that's where, I think of some of these urban environments that just don't have the capitalism to hang on. I don't think it changes our development philosophy at all? I mean, I think good trader has a good trade areas. I mean we -- there's a lot of talk about migration out of some of the bigger cities, we'll see how that plays out. I think that, I think eventually we're going to have some really good opportunities to do some work in Manhattan as an example, I think that, it was very difficult from a cost standpoint, pre-COVID, to justify building more restaurants there. But I think post COVID, we might have, we might have some opportunities. So I don't think from a development standpoint, it has a tremendous amount of impact. We'll continue to look. We know where we have holes in each brand, from trade areas, and we're going to try to fill them.\nLauren Silberman: Great. And you touched on this a bit, but with regards to fine dining brands, and maybe the Yard House as well. To what extent are these brands driven by tourism or large business conventions? And how are you thinking about that recovery? And do you need some of these exact exogenous factors just return to wholesale recapture?\nRick Cardenas: Well absolutely. We got a bunch of Yard Houses tied to baseball stadiums and football stadiums, and LA LIVE is our best Yard House in the system. And that's been decimated because of what's happening with sporting events. So yes, there's a lot, there's a few of our brands that, a few of our restaurants that are tied to that, and they'll come back. I'm a big believer that, we're going get back to normal, it\u2019s going to be great restaurants. But for the time being, we just have to run them as efficiently as we possibly can, and do the best we can with what we have.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of James Rutherford from Stephens. Your line is open.\nJames Rutherford: Hey, thanks for getting me in here. So quick question on the capacity bottlenecks at Olive Garden specifically? And it seems like it would be key to drive traffic at non-peak times and certain there's things you're doing around that. But are there any kinds of incentives you can do to bring people in during those shoulder periods? Or is it a situation where you're really fully utilizing that capacity already during the off periods as well?\nRick Cardenas: No. I mean, I think that's something we face, pre-COVID with how do you how do you increase your capacity at certain down times of the day? I think that's, I think that's high, higher to high activity, exercise with very low payout. I think that one of the important things about a restaurant is that downtime to help you prepare for the break between lunch and dinner is important. So you can get ready for dinner. I mean, it's there's parts of us we have cycles in our business, and they're important. I think we would, I think that we've been very disciplined has process to make sure that we're not chasing, what I would call this low return activity. And so I don't -- I don't think there's a whole lot there. I do think that what happens is as your business starts to improve, especially midweek or early week is that your, your lunch last 15 minutes longer your dinner last, 15, 20 minutes longer. That's important. Trying to drive people into your restaurant, two o'clock 30 years, I found that to be a waste of time and money and effort.\nJames Rutherford: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open. \nSara Senatore: Thank you. I had sort of a related question on that and click on Cheddar\u2019s, but on the -- on the capacity I guess, as I think about 50% capacity across the system, that seems pretty standard for a lot of restaurants and I appreciate California's basis points. You know, how should I think about 50% capacity per se and all of our endorses [ph] may be competitors, I guess if it\u2019s all [technical difficulty]. You have been more capacity then mercy other competition. I don't know if any numbers about that. And then I guess I\u2019ll just have a quick follow up on centers, please.\nRick Cardenas: Hey Sarah you were breaking up quite a bit. So let me see if I get the gist of your question. I think it was about the you know most restaurants are at this 50% capacity level. But how does that impact Olive Garden versus competitors. And I think the way I would, I would frame it is just average unit volumes. Olive Garden last year was probably using a lot more of it\u2019s capacity then some of our competitors were using it at that time last year. And so as we think about AUVs and think about the comp differential, maybe even between nap track, we think that some of the some of the impact is that while we're at 50% capacity today, and we were at 100% capacity last year, we were using much more of our capacity maybe than someone else. I think that was the gist of your question, but it was really hard to hard to hear. And if I think you also had a question on Cheddar\u2019s?\nSara Senatore: Yes. That was actually exactly my question. I -- but I wasn't sure if you had any sense of what the average capacity might look like through the industry, just to help us sort of think through that. But the real question on Cheddar\u2019s is, you talked about off-premise. I have been sort of slow at that time. I think we were starting to see some improvement in comps and then this pandemic hit. Could you talk a little bit about any kind of metrics, and maybe in particular, I think that's where you've seen a lot. Is there any sense of kind of quantify [Indiscernible]? Just, just a little bit more color on that?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Sarah. Broken up again, but I think I caught most of it until the end. I think you were asking about the impact for Cheddar\u2019s and how we've improved margins that Cheddar\u2019s versus maybe the rest? And Gene mentioned. I think that was your question. So Gene mentioned that Cheddar\u2019s has had the biggest transformation in our business model. On an hourly labor basis that we said, we had about 350 basis points for Darden and proven an hourly labor, Cheddar\u2019s was close to three times that. And so it was a very big improvement at Cheddar\u2019s in their margin structure because of the simplification they did, and the work they've done. And the fact that they went from maybe less than 5% To Go sales to over 20 in a short period of time. And we think we'll continue to build that To Go volume. But Cheddar\u2019s did make the biggest transformation in their margin structure. And we think a lot of that will stick.\nSara Senatore: Right. Your [indiscernible] mumbled question. So thank you very much.\nRick Cardenas: I have triplets. I've interpreted mumbles a lot of time.\nSara Senatore: You should talk to my four year old -- probably do better than I do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGregory Francfort: Hey, thanks. Thanks for sneaking me in. The question I had was back on the margin is probably for Rick. I think you've talked in the past about margins at Olive Garden above 20% at the level at which you reinvest and I think you were there, right around there pre-COVID. And so as you think about the 100 to 150 basis points of margin upside. Is that going to be spread relatively similarly across brands? Or I mean, do you think it gets overweight to the LongHorn and other businesses just given where the segment margins were pre-COVID? Thank you very much.\nRick Cardenas: Greg. Yes, I think it overweighs to other brands. I mean, we'll -- we should still see a little bit of margin prune at Olive Garden, just because the environments very different today than it was pre-COVID. And I think a lot of brands are out there, improving their margins in some way, shape, or form with simplification. And we just want to make sure our gap to the rest of the industry doesn't grow significantly. But we do believe that Olive Garden will see a little bit of margin improvement from where they were before. We just think that the improvement will come even greater in some of our other brands, Cheddar\u2019s and some of our other brands in the other segment.\nGregory Francfort: Thanks for the sauce.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. And Gene, your answer to David Palmer's questions on off-premise I think it's going to be like one of the great discussed topics, probably of this month. So thank you for that. The question got to that Thank you. LongHorn is helpful for all of us. It's -- I would imagine it's nearly impossible to get a staffing model right. Just kind of anticipating how customers are going to come back what have you, especially with men of labor hours that you took out of the store. I just wanted to see like how honed in that model actually is me what do you kind of seeing in terms of the variations of margins relative to you having too much labor at any point in time, too can imagine too little labor. At any point in time where you've got you're just not after the amount of customers that for whatever reason decided to come in at five o'clock on a Tuesday that maybe could have led to some longer cable times, that could have actually in some way actually impaired your ability to drive the traffic that you could have until that labor model gets more fine-tuned.\nGene Lee: Yes, John, I think for Olive Garden because we're not doing a lot of outdoor dining. We don't have the capability there that business is a little bit easier to predict. We've been, the leadership of all of our businesses error on this side of more labor than less. And we're tracking number of servers per restaurant, per day trying to understand. As the business starts to grow, making sure that we have the appropriate staffing, where it gets more difficult as in some of the Yard Houses where we have some, a lot of outside dying, that that doesn't have any covers. And if it starts to rain, if it doesn't rain, I mean, that's where life gets a little bit more difficult for our operators. But I would say in the two big casual brands, they've gotten pretty good. And they need, what I would say a change in, in what's happening in the environment. In other words, if we go from 25% to 50%, that's going to change the flow of mix. That's going to change what's off-premise, on-premise. And it takes a few days to figure that out. But we're erring on the side. Believe it or not, I know our labor results are really strong, we're erring on the side of more labor, not less.\nJohn Ivankoe: Understood, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim Partners Your line is open.\nMatthew DiFrisco: Thank you so much. My question is with respect to Georgia, and the positive comps there. Can you I guess it sounds like you were saying the consumer obviously, we've known this for a while, the consumer is a little different than New York. However, is that also a byproduct of PPP sort of slowing down and having a lift? Or have we seen some closures happen there? I'm trying to get a picture of Georgia being a positive. Is it a positive market? Or is it just positive for Olive Garden and LongHorn? Or is the entire -- are dollars up for restaurant spending in the state of Georgia year-over-year? Or is it just a smaller pie and you've won consolidated a lot of that share? Thank you.\nGene Lee: A couple things. First, first of all, the majority of the restaurants that are positive in Georgia are Longhorn, not Olive Garden. Olive Garden performed well in Georgia, but nowhere near what Olive Garden is, I mean, what LongHorn is. And LongHorn has had a strong footprint, and we got 45 restaurants in the city of Atlanta, where every three miles, we've got a restaurant. And we've always done extremely well there and the brand is, is loved there. So the brand strength there is fantastic. That's one component. The other component is that especially when you get 15 miles outside of the city, life is pretty is normal there. It's not pretty nice, it\u2019s normal there. And I landed Atlanta airport the other day, and not one person had a mask on. No, I was in a hotel, I stopped, I went up to a rooftop deck and it was too deep at a bar -- at the bar. I mean, so I mean, it's just a different life in Georgia. I know it's hard for you guys in New York, to even imagine that. But you still can't get around Georgia, there's so much traffic around the city of Atlanta. So in the city area, there's a little bit more, but I would tell you that, and I think if you look at other parts of the country in different states, behaviour is fairly normal.\nRick Cardenas: So I guess that would be then the industry on a year-over-year basis also for or the peers, it seems like it's a rising tide. They just haven't taken as much of a dip down.\nGene Lee: Well I think they haven\u2019t taken much dip down. But I think LongHorn is significantly outperforming most people in that market. And they always have John, I mean, they've always -- it's always been the core of that brand. And one of the thing remember, Georgia is one of the first to open, right. So they've been dealing with reopen for a long time, a lot longer than other states. So the longer a restaurant or a market is open, the more people start getting a little feeling a little bit more comfortable.\nMatthew DiFrisco: Okay, and just on that I mentioned PPP also. Can you guys talk about sort of what anywhere in or how, what your outlook is for the potential amount of seats maybe to leave the casual dining market. So say when we are in this time next year, how many seats might have exited?\nRick Cardenas: You know what we're comfortable to believe in somewhere between 5% and 15%. I think there's some other industry folks saying more than that, but I think 5 to 15. I think you remember once a restaurant, it\u2019s a restaurant. A lot of these will get recapitalized in the next few years, but I definitely believe that we'll be competing against less competition on the other side of this crisis.\nMatthew DiFrisco: Excellent. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett from Truist Securities. Your line is open\nJake Bartlett: Great, thanks for taking the questions. I had really had two quick ones. In the first, on the menu simplification, can you quantify how many less items for instance, that is just going to have a sensitivity as to the scale of the simplification? And then Gene, I'm not going to ask you about third party delivery. I think I know the answer. But I'm curious about your experience with in-house delivery and lowering the minimum check or the minimum order, for instance, is that something you want to lean into a little bit? Maybe continue to, to lower that to increase your in-house delivery?\nGene Lee: I think the answer to the second one is that we'll continue to evaluate that. But we don't see a big upside there. What was the first -- percent of menu simplification, each brand is very, very each brand is very, very different. We range somewhere between 20% reduction to 40% reduction in one brand. The easiest thing to do is to go you know, go find the menus.\nJake Bartlett: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBrian Vaccaro: Hey, thanks, guys. And thanks for the extra time. Rick, could you just provide a little more color on the other OpEx line, obviously, down around 20% versus pre-COVID levels. Just walk through some of the more significant cost reductions have been and how you expect those costs to come back? And then would you be willing to provide the fiscal 1Q comps for the individual brands within the fine dining and other business segments? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, on the restaurant expense line, just want to give you a couple of titbits when we talked about business interruption of $10 million. That was a proceed that we got, that hit our restaurant expense lines. We did have some rent reductions in the quarter, a cash rent reductions were bigger than the P&L impact. The P&L impact was about $3 million. We had some most of our savings are in utilities, in smallwares, and repairs and maintenance. And we would expect that as dining room start to reopen as they get busy again, we'd have R&M start to increase, as well as small wares in utilities. Those savings are maybe not as permanent, right? Because those are just because their volumes are down. And another point to mention is, we are spending money on PPE for masks, for our team gloves, chemicals, etcetera. And that's about $4 million to $5 million a quarter.\nBrian Vaccaro: Okay. And then the comps for Fine Dining and other big segments.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. On the comp side, we mentioned about a year ago that we were going to start providing comps only at a segment level. And this was our first quarter that was the case. And so we're going to continue with that.\nBrian Vaccaro: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJared Garber: Good Morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just a quick one for me. As you think about longer term capacity, maybe if you just focus on Olive Garden. Is there a level of average weekly sales or AUVs, how are you going to talk about it? That sort of a limit for Olive Garden, obviously, the off-premise business can be quite additive. But as you get back to sort of 100% in dining room capacity, how should we think about the longer term sort of cap, if you will, on AUVs in that brand? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Well, I think there is there is no cap. I mean, I think that, if you reach your -- you start to reach your capacity for just count, you have pricing power, and you can you can move your AUVs that way. I think pre-COVID, we were getting close to over $5 million on average unit volumes. So I think that, we'll definitely, hopefully you can get back there and get past that. I don't -- I don't ever think of a cap for a concept. Now we know that when you start adding new units, they're not going to come on at the average. Usually we can create a strong IRR with restaurants that that come in a little bit below the below the average and but overtime, we've been able to get that average to a pretty good level at 5 million.\nJared Garber: Thanks so much.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.\nGene Lee: Thank you. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you that we plan to release second quarter results on Friday, December 18th before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gene Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Given the ever-changing environment we continue to operate in, I am very pleased with what we accomplished during the quarter. We are focused on four key priorities; the health and safety of our team members and guests, in-restaurant execution in a complex operating environment, investing in and deploying technology to improve the guest experience, and transforming our business model. The progress we've made in these areas combined with our operating results gave us the confidence to repay the $270 million term loan and reinstate the quarterly dividend. Let me provide more detail on the four priorities. First, health and safety of our team members and guests remains our top priority. Following CDC guidelines and local requirements, our teams continue to practice our enhanced safety protocols, including daily team member health monitoring. We also continue to configure our dining rooms for social distancing to create a safe, welcoming environment while maximizing allowable capacity. A key part of this work is installing booth partitions to enable us to safely increase capacity where permissible. At the end of August, we had completed installation in just over 500 restaurants in our total portfolio. Operating in this environment adds another layer of complexity to an already complex operation, and I am proud of the commitment our teams make every day to keep our guests and each other safe. Second, we are laser focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy to drive restaurant level execution that creates great guest experience, whether that's in our dining rooms, outdoors on our patios or in their homes. But it is not easy. Executing at a high level is more complex today due to COVID-19 restrictions that vary by market. Additionally, the constantly changing mix between on-premise and off-premise plus expanded outdoor dining that is weather dependent, reached unpredictability in sales. This is why the work we continue to do to streamline our menus and improve our processes and procedures is so important. Removing complexity from our operations has allowed our restaurant teams to execute more consistently in this unique environment. Our operators continue to deliver great guest experiences by displaying a high level of flexibility, creativity, and passion everyday, and I am thrilled to see that that reflected in our guest satisfaction metrics. Third, we are continuing to invest in and implement technology to remove friction from the guest experience. This includes providing multiple ways for our guests to order inside and outside the restaurant across our digital storefronts. Additionally, we are deploying mobile solutions to make it easier for our guests to let us know when they have arrived to dine or pick up curbside order-to-go. We are also expanding mobile payment options, providing additional convenience for our guests. For our three largest brands combined, more than 50% of our off-premise sales during the quarter were fully digital transactions where guests ordered and paid online. Finally and most importantly, we transformed our business model. Even with the sales declines we are experiencing, our restaurants continue to produce high absolute sales volumes. Therefore, we made the strategic decision to focus on adjusting our cost structure in order to generate strong cash flows, while making the appropriate investments in our businesses. This provides us a stronger foundation for us to build on as sales trends improve. The first step in this process was to re-imagine our offerings. This resulted in simplified menus across the platform driving significant efficiencies in food waste and direct labor productivity. Additionally, due to capacity restrictions, we significantly reduced marketing promotional spending along with other incentives we have historically used to drive sales. We will continue to evaluate our marketing promotional activity as the operating environment evolves. Finally, we have further optimized our support structure which is driving G&A efficiencies. The results of all these efforts to transform our business model can be seen in the fact that we generated adjusted EBITDA of $185 million for the quarter. Turning to our business segments, Olive Garden delivered strong average weekly sales per restaurant of $70,000 while significantly strengthening their business model, resulting in higher segment profit margin than last year. They were able to capitalize on simplification initiatives that strengthened the business model while making additional investments in abundance and value. This work was critical to position Olive Garden to drive future profitable top line sales as capacity restrictions ease. Olive Garden same restaurant sales for the quarter declined 28.2%, 220 basis points below the industry benchmark. Overall, capacity restrictions continue to limit their top line sales, particularly in key high-volume markets like California and New Jersey where diners were closed for the majority of the quarter. In fact, restaurants that had some level of dining capacity for the entire quarter averaged more than $75,000 in weekly sales retaining nearly 80% of their last year's sales. Given the limited capacity environment during the quarter, Olive Garden made a strategic decision to reduce their marketing spend as well as incentives and eliminate their promotional activity. They will continue to evaluate their level of marketing activity as capacity restrictions ease. Additionally, off-premise continued to see strong growth with off-premise sales increasing 123% in the quarter representing 45% of total sales. Thanks to technology investments we continue to make, online sales made up almost 60% of total off-premise sales, more than tripling last year's online sales. Finally, Olive Garden successfully opened three new restaurants in the quarter which are exceeding expectations. LongHorn had a very strong quarter. Same restaurant sales declined 18.1%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 790 basis points. This strong guest loyalty and operational execution helped drive their outperformance, while they also benefited from their geographic footprint. In fact, same-restaurant sales were positive for the quarter in Georgia and Mississippi. Additionally, the LongHorn team made significant investments in food quality and operational simplicity, which led to improved productivity and better execution. They also took a number of steps to improve the overall digital guest experience. Off-premise sales grew by more than 240% representing 28% of total sales. Finally, LongHorn successfully opened two restaurants during the quarter. The brands in our Fine Dining segment are performing better than anticipated. While weekday sales continue to be impacted by reduction in business travel, conventions, and sporting events, we saw strong guest traffic on the weekends, and believe there will be additional demand as capacity restrictions begin to ease. And lastly, our Other Business segment also delivered strong operational improvement with segment profit margin of 12.8%. This was only 130 basis points below last year despite a 39% decline in same restaurant sales. Yard House's footprint in California is impacting same restaurant sales in this segment. Finally, I continue to be impressed by how our team members are responding to take care of our guests and each other. We know our people are our greatest competitive advantage, and I want to thank everyone of our team members. We are succeeding, thanks to your hard work and resilience. Now I'll turn it over to Rick. (Auidt End) I'll take the execution part, and I'll let Rick talk about the margin piece. I think a lot of our execution is coming from the streamlined menus. And our ability to put out products with increased frequency of that product is helping our execution and our team members are becoming much better at doing that. When you limit your menu and you focus on key products, the quality of that product just continues to go up. And I also think it transcends itself into the dining rooms. And I think today, we've gotten used to the complexity of operating with the COVID requirements, and every day I think we're running better and better restaurants. Rick, do you want to talk about the margins? No, we've seen no falloff with the stimulus. Actually, we're seeing average weekly sales across the system improve every single week. So, we're feeling pretty good about that. So, we're seeing some restrictions be eased throughout the country, so really nothing from a regionality standpoint. I think you've just got to look at the mobility index and you've got to follow what's happening with restrictions, and you can see guest traffic move along with that. Let me work backwards to your question, outdoor capacity is really de minimis for us overall as the system. The good news is that we haven't really been able to use a lot of our outdoor capacity in Florida, it has been raining every single day here for the last six weeks. So we're going to start getting that back. As we lose outdoor capacity up north, we will pick up a lot more in Florida than we've been able to use. So, for that when we think about outdoor capacity, it is really not that meaningful for us. As far as what's going to drive in the short term, some more same restaurant sales is additional capacity. We need to get California back. We need some other areas to increase their capacity from 25% to 50%. Once you get past 50% as long as the six-foot rule is in place, you still are not going to really be able to max out your dining rooms. In some areas we're getting our bar tops back which are important, gives us more capacity inside the restaurant. And so, I think it really comes down to just the incremental improvements in the capacity levels. We're going to probably continue to roll out booth partitions, we'll probably close to double what we have right now and that gives us six to seven extra tables per restaurant in the jurisdictions that allow us to do that, and not every jurisdiction allows us to do that. I think that our teams are being very respectful of the requirements in their operating environment, and we're trying to create first and foremost a safe environment for our team members and our guests, and we're not trying to push same restaurant sales and risk that experience for our team members and guests. So, I would look at getting California back is big in Olive Garden. We've got 100 restaurants there. Well, most of the capacity restrictions are around the 50% range, 50% capacity, some are 100% but if you average out our company, when you take the six foot rule, et cetera, we're probably at the 50% capacity range even at the end of the quarter. I think our engagement with our team members goes all the way back to the beginning of COVID, I mean it actually goes beyond that, but I think how we held the situation with emergency pay and taking care and thinking of our people and staying engaged with them and paying their benefits. We invested over $100 million in that short period of time into our team members. So bringing them back to work has been fairly easy for us. And I think our team members are really engaged in what they are doing. And so, and we've got this strong culture for a long time. And our team member retention is better than ever which is really exciting to see. I mean I'm looking at retention numbers for our team members that I'd never thought I would see in this industry. I've been working in this industry for over 30 years. I've never seen retention like this which gives us the ability to execute it at the highest level. And as we bring people back to work or bring them back, our most productive and our most dedicated team members. So I think the spirit is high in our restaurant. I think people are excited to be out there, they're making money. I think they're bringing happiness to people that come into our restaurants and I think that energy is \u2013 in this very difficult time in transferring between the guest and the team member, and I'm in the restaurants every day, and I'm in one of our restaurants most every day, sometimes twice a day. I would tell you that, the attitude is just absolutely fantastic and our team members are doing a great job. Well, Brian, I think on the G&A side, we talked about the voluntary emergency, I'm sorry voluntary early retirement program, and that's going to save us $25 million to $30 million a year on a rolling basis. And we would we would expect G&A to start coming back up as we start getting travel et cetera. We didn't do a whole lot of travel in the first quarter, but most of our investments will be back in the restaurant as you think about marketing spend and labor and other things. So I would say that if you look at what we say in the 90% range, most of our investment will be back in the restaurant. Our G&A, we would hope, our G&A would be at least below 5% for the foreseeable future. I think the majority of it is geographic and I think the brand strength in Georgia has been incredibly impressive. And I think that it's just a market where there's a lot of loyalty to the brand. I think the market, Georgia, State of Georgia trusts LongHorn and I think people are going to where they're really comfortable. And so I do think that their consumer maybe a little bit better off economically. But I mean, their performance is impressive without a doubt, but it's being driven by Georgia, I mean it is being driven a lot by their footprint. Well, I think we can see that temporary barriers, I think, the team continues to look at how do you, can you move a few tables in the dining room to improve the overall capacity. So I think they continue to try to modify that. I think the thing when you think about Olive Garden is focused on the absolute volumes. You know it is $75,000 a week, these are these are healthy, healthy businesses. And the off-premise business continues to thrive, which is a place that we're going to. We start putting some marketing money back into that business. It will be focused on trying to drive off-premise not in-premise. We continue to evaluate what's the best way to go with that investment spend, when is the right time to use it? And so, the other thing I would tell you is that, it can probably be hard for you to believe, but we have one restaurant that cost us 50 basis points in comps. That's the Times Square Olive Garden and we start every single week $300,000 in the hole from a comp store basis. We are going to get 25% capacity back in Times Square on the 30th, but that's -- you wake up every day and you are $300,000 short just in that one restaurant. That's our best restaurant in the Olive Garden system. We do $50 million there, and now we're doing, $2500 a day. And so, we've got some odd ball things. Getting California back is going to be huge. California is a big market for us with high volumes. We have a higher check average and we can see because we're starting to get some counties back, and we can see the impact on that on a daily weekly basis. Okay Andrew. On the labor line, remember we've got two components of labor, one is the hourly labor, which is where we saw a lot of efficiencies, and the other one is the management labor, which is more fixed in nature. We would expect the hourly labor to not be as favorable going forward, just because of training expenses. We didn't have as much training in the first quarter, and we'll continue to, we're going to start having some training in Q2 and beyond. But as our sales pick up, our management labor should be leveraged a little bit more than it was before. So, I think there was a question earlier on whether it get to at 100%, and that 100 and 150 basis point improvement will mostly come out of labor and some cost of sales. Yes, I think on those high volume, high traffic promotions, we're going to feel, we have to feel comfortable that we got pretty much 100% capacity unless the promotion, we are speaking about promotions that drive the off-premise and drive off-promise experience. When I think about marketing, and the team thinks about marketing, I think that we want to try to get far along as we possibly can through this crisis or cycle, and then fully understand what the competitive set is going to be, what the economic backdrop is going to be, and then we'll figure out how to appropriately layer back in all our promotional, marketing and promotional activity and our incentives. We think we can layer those back in smarter and more effective than we had them in the system before, and this is a terrible thing that we're going through, but we're trying to find, okay we're trying to find the positives in this to really rethink, and rethink how we go to market with our businesses. And this is fortunately once in a lifetime option to be able to do things that we probably couldn't do, where we were pre-COVID. So you know, I think long term, we're going to look at the situation and we'll decide when we layer in our best promotional options, and we may have to re-imagine and revisit some of those promotional options to our guests so that we can maybe do it at a higher margin rate, but we have lots of questions and a lot of work to do around that. There's nothing concrete there, because each market is behaving differently. And so, when you see restrictions change, and maybe your capacity goes from 25 to 50 in certain markets that volume just switches from off-premise to on-premise, in other markets it doesn't. It depends on what's happening. We believe there's a good percentage of our off-premise today is being generated by people coming to the restaurant that can't get in, because the wait is too long, and there's no place to wait inside our restaurants. And so we think that those people have a tendency to just opt into the off-premise experience. So we really can't quantify that for you, because every market is different. I would take, I want both, I want a simple operating model, and I want higher sales, and I think that we're setting up for that, because I think there's a few dynamics that are in our favor. Number one, there's definitely been a capacity, there'll be capacity coming out of the system and we believe that we're well positioned to take share. And we think that this simplified operations will help us improve execution we will get better throughput and so we think there's a pathway to both, higher sales and better margins. I think our teams have done an incredible job of reimagining almost every aspect of their business through this. And I see a pathway to get there. I think Rick is bringing you back to the 90% only as a way to communicate where we think margins are going to be at a future sales level. We're not setting a target saying that we'd be happy with that. We see a pathway for our sales to get above that and we see a pathway for our margins to be above pre-COVID levels at that time. So, as you know so far Jeff, we have seen no change in demand based on COVID levels in a market, unless capacity restrictions change. So, if you're example we're in South Florida, when we had the spike after the 4th of July, and the restaurant restrictions were very limited, we definitely saw demand drop, but that was not because of the consumer, it was more because of the restrictions the local municipalities put on us. We see a pretty resilient consumer out there. I know that's hard for you guys in New York to imagine, but the rest of the country is not operating that way. And so, I would tell you that what we're seeing is, it's all being controlled by the local municipalities, that they're managing demand more than the consumer. Well, I think the independents obviously have a tough time right, and as we think about it we think somewhere between 5% and 15% of capacity will come out of the system during this, maybe a little bit more but a lot of people will get recapitalized quickly and get some of these boxes back open. Obviously that that's going to benefit us in the short term and in the long term. As far as real estate so far has been one of the things that, my hypothesis has been, I've been a little bit off on. We've yet to see a meaningful change and what we can acquire real estate, I thought that being one of the only bidders out there, that we would see the costs come down. I think we're still going through the price discovery process on that and we'll see how that plays out long term. I've got to believe that we will benefit from availability and hopefully price. Availability is already there. It's just trying to get through what we think the property's worth versus what the REIT or the landlord thinks the property is worth. And so that will have some impact and help us grow, get to our 2% to 3% new unit growth over time. That's a good question John. I think that, going into this that we did the majority of our pickup with someone coming into the restaurant and picking up the food. We set up our process, because we believed and we proved out that accuracy and on time were the two most important things that the off-premise consumer wanted. Through this we had to go to a different experience which was when we moved very, very quickly to curbside. And we what we've learned through this is that curbside is a better option, and that the burden of on time and accurate needs to get on us and we need to have better systems to be able to deliver the same level of accuracy that we were delivering in pre-COVID. And what that means is, in one of our restaurants we are on a path to build better capabilities to handle the in-restaurant pick up. And now, as we pivoted to curbside the capabilities that we need to build inside are different. The good news is that they're cheaper because they're really not consumer facing. And so it will cost us a little bit less to be able to create those capabilities. But technology and when the expectation of the consumer is for a curbside experience. And when the expectation of the consumer is for a curbside experience, and we've taken a lot of friction out of that experience over the last 12 weeks, and we're in the middle of really rolling out some technology today to really make that experience a whole lot better. As just about notification when you're in our parking lot, versus we had a very manual procedure that we had to implement in the beginning of this. And eventually, we'll get the geofencing, and we'll catch up to what some of the bigger retail retailers are doing. So we actually think that there's a big benefit in this consumer shift, because we're going to take all these people that were in our dining room -- in our front door, picking up food, and they'll never enter our business -- building again, which makes it a better experience for our dining guests. So that's really the big change, John that for that has to happen. And right now we have the benefit of some of our -- have any extra space inside our restaurant that enables us to stage some of this off-premise work. But as we gain more capacity, we will need to modify some spaces. And actually add some like in a long home we'll have to bump out of the side of the building to be able to handle this extra demand. But I see it as all positive. We think, we can do curbside much more cost effectively than we can do picking up the food inside the restaurant. So there's two questions in there John, and I'll get to the virtual brand in a second. The first question is, obviously the data is richer when we're capturing the data from our digital guest, which feeds into our huge database on our ability to market to them. So we can figure out to that, and through our tokens that these are, these are dying, our off-premise guests only. Then we can tell all our marketing towards that guest and towards that experience. We understand what they are buying, and what they want to buy. And so we can get smarter with that. We're pretty smart. Prior to this, we just have more information today, and we'll be able to -- our data scientists will be able to use that and market effectively. Let me just pivot to virtual brands, I'm shocked that it took this long to come up. But only give you my take my take on this. Everybody around the room is very nervous right now. But, I think people are in different places, and they're trying to approach this and deal with this moment in time differently. For us, this is not the right approach, we want to focus on brands that we've got 20 plus years and hundreds of millions of dollars invested in trying to build, and we want to make sure that they're executing at a high level. I think brands are going to matter. And I don't think you can -- I think brands are developed over a long period of time, around delivering a promise to a consistent promise to a consumer. I think you have to have a functional need and emotional need. And I think that's what I think that's what our brand builders have done for decades. And to get out on a digital platform and try to do that, I think people got to try to do what they want to do. I'm not -- I'm not saying it's a good idea or a bad idea. It's not for us. Brands are going to matter, and we think it's a distraction. I'll be very, very clear. Our guest satisfaction scores are improving dramatically. I want to -- I want to put some context around that, which is, what we don't understand is, is it just the consumer expectations are maybe different to this experience. So we're happy directionally where they're going. And we're happy directly where they're going compared to our competitors. But at the same time, we will -- we were not, patting ourselves on the back too much, because this is definitely a different environment and the consumer feedback is there is different. So we don't know what the expectations are, but we are very pleased directionally where we're heading with our own internal and in some of the industry stuff that we're seeing and how we're comparing to competitors. You guys are getting really good at getting multiple questions in one question. Let's talk about Cheddar's first, and I'll come back to thoughts on M&A. Cheddar's is from a business model standpoint, Cheddar's has had the biggest transformation. The work that John Wilkerson and his team have done, it's been transformative. And I couldn't be more excited about directionally where they're heading. Tactically, one of the biggest changes, and one of the one of the things that we had to really speed up was off-premise capabilities. We had very -- we had very, limited capabilities going to COVID. We only had two phone lines going into most of our restaurants. We couldn't -- we couldn't even take the demand over the phone. We didn't have online ordering. So the team rallied and this was supposed to be an initiative that was going to go all the way through fiscal 2021, really wasn't supposed to be fully operational at 2022. They got together and they've been able to real quickly upgraded their phone lines, they have four phone lines coming in and we now have online ordering, new packaging's being rolled out as we're speaking. And they developed a native app that actually getting some pretty good adoption. And so that piece of it is been really exciting that they've been able to move as quickly as they possibly can. Their in-restaurant dining is held strong, they still don't have a huge robust off-premise business, but we need to build that. It wasn't something that people thought of Cheddar's for, but we think there's a big opportunity there. So, I'm thrilled directionally with what they're doing and the transformation they have made in their business model. Just briefly on M&A, there's nothing new to report here. We continue to evaluate opportunities and discuss with our board. We are very happy with our current portfolio. And we believe, that we can achieve our growth targets and our value creation metrics with the portfolio that we have. We believe there is a great opportunity for all our brands. I think that we have to go back and go back to what I'd said earlier. We have to understand what the competitive set is. We have to understand what the economic backdrop is. We'll have to analyze how well we can get to our consumer through television. We still believe that we can do that. We participate and we're still participating in the upfront. We think it's a good mechanism for us. And that's part of our skill benefit with Olive Garden. Right? We can advertise on a national platform. And we have some -- we have some efficiencies. And I think that we will still use that in the near term. But it will all depend on what the competitive set is and the economic backdrop. If we pull enough restaurants out, we may not have to advertise for a while. Well, it's a technology that's creating it. It's no one, no one taken the answer on the phone. We're dropping, you know, the consumers letting us know whether when they're in the parking lot, and we're just dropping the bag in their car. So there's just a lot less, interaction there. Just think just, the cost is just purely productivity efficiency. Thinking about a line of five or six people at a desk, or at the bar top in a restaurant waiting to get To Go versus having someone just pull up to a car and put a bag in the trunk. That's where the efficiencies come and technology is enabling all that. Well I think that, obviously we're missing the business travel and those types of dinners. So I mean, that was a big part of capital grow, and especially in your central business districts, you're always soft, and you're suburbia restaurant, during the week and you made up for on the weekends. I think we -- just another interesting titbit is that, look at capital growth comps, you're starting every week with over a million dollar shortfall just in the three restaurants in New York. We're doing 3000 bucks a day there with our 10 seats. Those restaurants do well over a million, a million dollars a week. And so, you just get this, just so much geographical differences in those businesses. We have some capital growth that's performing fairly well, especially in suburbia. But I'm confident as I see the sales volume on the weekends. I know we're turning away a lot of people and I know as soon as we can get a few more tables, we can continue to grow that business. And I'm confident that they're confident those businesses are going to be cash flow positive going forward. Yes, John, I think for Olive Garden because we're not doing a lot of outdoor dining. We don't have the capability there that business is a little bit easier to predict. We've been, the leadership of all of our businesses error on this side of more labor than less. And we're tracking number of servers per restaurant, per day trying to understand. As the business starts to grow, making sure that we have the appropriate staffing, where it gets more difficult as in some of the Yard Houses where we have some, a lot of outside dying, that that doesn't have any covers. And if it starts to rain, if it doesn't rain, I mean, that's where life gets a little bit more difficult for our operators. But I would say in the two big casual brands, they've gotten pretty good. And they need, what I would say a change in, in what's happening in the environment. In other words, if we go from 25% to 50%, that's going to change the flow of mix. That's going to change what's off-premise, on-premise. And it takes a few days to figure that out. But we're erring on the side. Believe it or not, I know our labor results are really strong, we're erring on the side of more labor, not less. A couple things. First, first of all, the majority of the restaurants that are positive in Georgia are Longhorn, not Olive Garden. Olive Garden performed well in Georgia, but nowhere near what Olive Garden is, I mean, what LongHorn is. And LongHorn has had a strong footprint, and we got 45 restaurants in the city of Atlanta, where every three miles, we've got a restaurant. And we've always done extremely well there and the brand is, is loved there. So the brand strength there is fantastic. That's one component. The other component is that especially when you get 15 miles outside of the city, life is pretty is normal there. It's not pretty nice, it's normal there. And I landed Atlanta airport the other day, and not one person had a mask on. No, I was in a hotel, I stopped, I went up to a rooftop deck and it was too deep at a bar -- at the bar. I mean, so I mean, it's just a different life in Georgia. I know it's hard for you guys in New York, to even imagine that. But you still can't get around Georgia, there's so much traffic around the city of Atlanta. So in the city area, there's a little bit more, but I would tell you that, and I think if you look at other parts of the country in different states, behaviour is fairly normal. Well I think they haven't taken much dip down. But I think LongHorn is significantly outperforming most people in that market. And they always have John, I mean, they've always -- it's always been the core of that brand. And one of the thing remember, Georgia is one of the first to open, right. So they've been dealing with reopen for a long time, a lot longer than other states. So the longer a restaurant or a market is open, the more people start getting a little feeling a little bit more comfortable. I think the answer to the second one is that we'll continue to evaluate that. But we don't see a big upside there. What was the first -- percent of menu simplification, each brand is very, very each brand is very, very different. We range somewhere between 20% reduction to 40% reduction in one brand. The easiest thing to do is to go you know, go find the menus. Thank you. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you that we plan to release second quarter results on Friday, December 18th before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. The encouraging trends and performance we experienced toward the end of the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Furthermore, the actions we took in response to COVID-19 to solidify our cash position, transform the business model, simplify operations, and strengthen the commitment of our team members, helped build a solid foundation for the future. These actions and our continued focus on pursuing profitable sales have resulted in strong first quarter performance that significantly exceeded our expectations. For the quarter total sales were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 28.4%. Same restaurant sales decreased 29%. Adjusted EBITDA was $185 million and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.56. Turning to the P&L, looking at food and beverage line, favorability from menu simplifications more than offset increased to go packaging costs. However, these inflations of over 7%, primarily impacting LongHorn, drove food and beverage expense 20 basis points higher than last year for the company. Restaurant labor were 20 basis points lower than last year with hourly labor as a percent of sales improving by over 350 basis points, driven by operational simplifications. This was mostly offset by deleverage in management labor. Restaurant expense included $10 million of business interruption insurance proceeds related to COVID-19 claims submitted in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Excluding this benefit we reduced restaurant expense per operating week by over 20% this quarter. For marketing we lowered absolute spending by over $40 million bringing marketing as a percent of sales to 1.9%, 130 basis points less than last year. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin was 17.8%, 20 basis points below last year, but particularly strong given the sales decline of 28%. General and administrative expenses were $10 million lower than last year as we effectively reduced expenses and right sized our support structure. Interest was $5 million higher than last year mostly related to the term loan that was outstanding for the majority of the quarter. And finally, our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate was 9%. All of this culminated in adjusted earnings after tax of $73 million, which exclude $48 million of performance adjusted expenses. These expenses were related to the voluntary early retirement incentive program and corporate restructuring completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Approximately $10 million of this expense is non-cash and the remaining will be cash outflows through Q2 of fiscal 2022. This restructuring resulted in a net 11% reduction in our workforce in the restaurant support center and field operations leadership positions. It is expected to save between $25 million and $30 million annually. We expect to see approximately three quarters of these savings throughout the remainder of fiscal 2021. Looking at our segment performance this quarter, despite a sales decline of 28%, Olive Garden increased segment profit margin by 110 basis points to 22.1%. This strong profitability was driven by simplified operations which reduced food and direct labor costs, as well as reduced marketing spending. LongHorn Steakhouse, Fine Dining and the Other Business segment delivered strong positive segment profit margins of 15.1%, 11.9%, and 12.8% respectively, despite the significant sales decline experienced in the quarter. These brands also benefited from simplified operations keeping segment profit margin at these levels. In the first quarter 68% of our restaurants operated with at least partial dining room capacity for the entire quarter. These restaurants had average weekly sales per restaurant of $69,000 and a same restaurant sales decline of 21.9%. And while Olive Garden and the Fine Dining segment had fewer dining rooms open than our average, these restaurants had the highest average weekly sales per restaurant of almost $76,000 and $90,000 respectively. At the start of the second quarter, we had approximately 91% of our restaurants with dining rooms open operating in at least limited capacity. Now turning to our liquidity and other matters. During the quarter, as we saw steadily improving weekly cash flows we gained confidence in our estimated cash flow ranges. We fully repaid the $270 million term loan took out in April. We ended the first quarter with $655 million in cash and another $750 million available in our untapped credit facility, giving us over $1.4 million of available liquidity. We generated over $160 million of free cash flow in the quarter and improved our adjusted debt to adjusted capital to 59% at the end of the quarter, well within our debt covenant of below 75%. Given our strong liquidity position, improvements in our business model, and better visibility into cash flow projections, our Board reinstituted a quarterly dividend. The board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share. This dividend represents 53% of our first quarter adjusted earnings after tax within our long-term framework for value creation. We will continue to have regular discussions with the Board on our future dividend policy. Our first quarter results were significantly better than we anticipated. The actions we took to simplify menus and operating procedures, and capture other cost savings, along with our choice to pursue profitable sales, have yielded strong results. And now with a full quarter operating under this environment, we have even better visibility into our business model. For the second quarter we expect total sales of approximately 82% of prior year, including approximately 100 basis points of headwind due to the Thanksgiving holiday moving back into the second fiscal quarter this year. We anticipate EBITDA between $200 million and $215 million and diluted net earnings per share between $0.65 and $0.75 on a diluted share base of 131 million shares. In this environment we continue to focus on building absolute sales volumes week-to-week and quarter-to-quarter. This may result in variability and sales comparison to last year as capacity constraints lead to less seasonality than we would have experienced historically. Said another way, if capacity and social distancing restrictions remain similar to where they are today, it will be challenging to dramatically increase our on-premise average in volumes. Our second quarter is typically our lowest averaging in volume quarter and our third quarter is typically our highest. Additionally, as capacity restrictions ease and sales normalize, we will be able to reinvest to drive the top line and a better overall guest experience. One last point before we take your questions. Based on our strong business model enhancements, we now think we can get to pre-COVID EBITDA dollars and approximately 90% of pre-COVID sales while still making appropriate investments in our business. And with that, we will take your questions. Yes, hey Andrew. I'm going to start with the 90% number that we gave a second ago. We have made improvements in our cost structure as Gene has mentioned and significantly improved our business model. As sales improve, remember we assume that some of these costs will come back, but not all of them. The 90% contemplates some costs returning along with continued reinvestments. And while the 90% sales level may change depending on the competitive environment and the economic backdrop, now I will say that if we get to 100% and we make some investments as we've been talking about, we could see margins improve by 100 basis points, maybe even 150, but again that depends on the economic backdrop, the competitive environment, and what do we have to do to get to that 100%. So, I wouldn't tie in the 100% to 150%, but I would at least get into the 90% based on our EBITDA, I'm sorry getting our EBITDA back based on 90% of sales. Yes, it is pretty close. It is not like we have a lot of new restaurants coming into play, so it is within a 100 basis points. Yes Andrew, on the partitions, depending on the restaurant foot layout, you're going to get six to eight more tables, and you know most of those will be four tops and the average party is 2.3. So I mean, I wouldn't say it's not de minimis, but sounds meaningful. I mean, you're getting, especially on the weekends you're getting another two seatings on those tables. So every little bit helps, because we have the demand for those tables, but it's not going to it's not going to move the top-line significantly. Yes David, our guidance first for sales for Q2, remember it incorporates a 100 basis point headwind for Thanksgiving. So we are running a little bit better than that quarter-to-date, but not by much. And so we do anticipate an increase of about 10% of average weekly sales from quarter one. It doesn't contemplate any significant change in capacity restrictions, other than the ones that we already know, other than the ones that have already been approved. But it also doesn't contemplate any significant change in sales due to a second wave or a vaccine approval. So that we thought 82% was fairly prudent, it's slightly low where we are running today, but it does take into effect the 100 basis point swing from Thanksgiving. Chris, as we mentioned, Olive Garden segment profit margin was 100 basis points better than last year? We've got a pretty good improvement in cost of sales, partly because of the question that was asked earlier about; about never any possible that actually drags a little bit margin for us. So cost of sales a little bit better. We improved our food waste significantly because of the operational changes that we've made. That said, a 22% margin on the sales levels they have. We're going to start reinvesting eventually. We've got marketing that was down about $20 million year-over-year for Olive Garden. And as capacity starts to come back online as Gene mentioned, we will look at our promotional cadence and our marketing cadence. But 22% is a pretty strong margin. So I wouldn't anticipate us significantly getting better than that, as we continue to reinvest to get back to a point of getting back over 100% of our sales. Our goal is to drive our sales profitably and we have enough room to invest to drive those sales profitably. It does contemplate higher off-premise missed and pre-COVID, but not significantly higher. I mean, as Gene mentioned, Cheddar's should be higher. Olive Garden should be higher, and LongHorn should be higher. But we're not going to be at 40% or 50% of sales premise when we've got full capacity dining rooms. As you -- as we open as Gene mentioned, as you -- as we open dining rooms, we start seeing that To Go business shift back into in restaurant, but we still are right now we're still retaining 60% of our peak premise sales. Yes, David I might. And I've got no empirical evidence to support this. But my theory is that off -- once we open up the dining and say we get back to a normal environment, where we have concerts and revise going to football games and -- I actually think off-premise will dip down below where it was. I think there's going to be a huge surge for on-premise dining. I think people are tired of this experience. They are utilizing this experience right now. But when I talk to people, and we did some research, people want to get back out socialized. I do think, then it comes back, it comes back higher than where we were. I think our thought processes, it's a little bit higher, but not terribly higher, and it will continue to grow over time as it has been. But I don't think that this is some big change that we're going to wake up in Olive Garden and be doing 35% off-premise, if we're going to concerts and having football games. Yes, Patrick. I'll start with -- we've shown week-to-week, we're continuing to build our average weekly sales. And as I mentioned earlier, Q2 is our lowest seasonal quarter and Q3 is our highest, so it does take a lot of increase in average weekly sales to get to the same comp level Q3 as Q2. But what we are going to do and what we continue to do is evaluate the situation. As restaurants open, as dining room capacity is open. I mean as Gene mentioned, if dining room capacity don't continue to expand, we still have some levers to pull in the off-premise side. So that's what we will do, we will continue to advertise off-premise if it's what we need to do to continue to build sales. But as long as we do that profitably, our intention is to grow our sales profitably from where we are today. And so that's what we'll do. We'll continue to focus on off-premise. Now, if dining rooms can reopen completely, we should see an increase in sales. Well, the biggest driver of the cost savings is waste. And that in that the touch Menu that's lacking promotional activity, there's some other things that are influencing that. I think that the challenge for the teams is if they need to add menu items, to fulfil a need, can they do that without adding complexity? I think they have to. I think, in their calculus prior to this, there wasn't enough weight put on the complexity of adding new menu items. So it wasn't enough. No one thought about that. I think today, that's part of the -- the part of the thought process is they think about adding something. How do we do this and make sure we maintain our productivity and don't increase our waste? So I think a better way to say that is, as we do menu developments, it's going through a better filter today, that I think will have a long longer -- have a long lasting impact on our ability to maintain these cost savings. Yes Jeff, for the quarter, we were down somewhere around 50% in California. Now remember, they were open for a little bit of time, and then they re-shut down. But we are seeing some pretty good unit volumes in California. And I was talking to Olive Garden more than more than any other brand. But and as Gene mentioned, Yard House is significantly impacted in California. But we were down. And if you take California out of Olive Garden, it's a 200 basis point swing for the quarter. Yes, I would, what I would say is, instead of getting an individual restaurants; let's talk about a couple of states. I mean, Longhorn was positive in Georgia. The entire system was positive in Georgia for the quarter. We have a lot more restaurants that are positive now than we did going earlier. The last couple of weeks, it's been even better than that. So without getting an individual restaurants, we have it all contemplated in our guidance for Q2. And so I'd rather leave it at that. Well Brett, you got a lot in there \u2013 in that person. You got more, I can't wait. But let's talk about hiring. Hiring is very local. There are different pockets of the country that are more stressed than others. I will make a global comment, say I've been amazed at how, how well the hospitality workforce was absorbed into other areas during COVID. And so there hasn't been like, this still, there's still stress in that environment. We're still seeing, we still expect wages to rise somewhere between 3% and 5% for the year. As far as technology, technology goes, and the adaptation is so -- is easy today, right? And then we're doing that we haven't done it. We haven't focused a lot on improving technology in restaurant all of our stuffs really been, all of our efforts been focused on the consumer right now. We do have some -- we will get back to some projects that will modernize some of our tools in restaurant that'll hopefully help increase productivity. And as far as off-premise and we're using for off-premise for us are tipped employees. For more, they've got a higher average weight, but they do collect some gratuities on their service. Well, I think that the markets that have had the tightest restrictions are going to have the most closures. Because I think that's where, I think of some of these urban environments that just don't have the capitalism to hang on. I don't think it changes our development philosophy at all? I mean, I think good trader has a good trade areas. I mean we -- there's a lot of talk about migration out of some of the bigger cities, we'll see how that plays out. I think that, I think eventually we're going to have some really good opportunities to do some work in Manhattan as an example, I think that, it was very difficult from a cost standpoint, pre-COVID, to justify building more restaurants there. But I think post COVID, we might have, we might have some opportunities. So I don't think from a development standpoint, it has a tremendous amount of impact. We'll continue to look. We know where we have holes in each brand, from trade areas, and we're going to try to fill them. Well absolutely. We got a bunch of Yard Houses tied to baseball stadiums and football stadiums, and LA LIVE is our best Yard House in the system. And that's been decimated because of what's happening with sporting events. So yes, there's a lot, there's a few of our brands that, a few of our restaurants that are tied to that, and they'll come back. I'm a big believer that, we're going get back to normal, it's going to be great restaurants. But for the time being, we just have to run them as efficiently as we possibly can, and do the best we can with what we have. No. I mean, I think that's something we face, pre-COVID with how do you how do you increase your capacity at certain down times of the day? I think that's, I think that's high, higher to high activity, exercise with very low payout. I think that one of the important things about a restaurant is that downtime to help you prepare for the break between lunch and dinner is important. So you can get ready for dinner. I mean, it's there's parts of us we have cycles in our business, and they're important. I think we would, I think that we've been very disciplined has process to make sure that we're not chasing, what I would call this low return activity. And so I don't -- I don't think there's a whole lot there. I do think that what happens is as your business starts to improve, especially midweek or early week is that your, your lunch last 15 minutes longer your dinner last, 15, 20 minutes longer. That's important. Trying to drive people into your restaurant, two o'clock 30 years, I found that to be a waste of time and money and effort. Hey Sarah you were breaking up quite a bit. So let me see if I get the gist of your question. I think it was about the you know most restaurants are at this 50% capacity level. But how does that impact Olive Garden versus competitors. And I think the way I would, I would frame it is just average unit volumes. Olive Garden last year was probably using a lot more of it's capacity then some of our competitors were using it at that time last year. And so as we think about AUVs and think about the comp differential, maybe even between nap track, we think that some of the some of the impact is that while we're at 50% capacity today, and we were at 100% capacity last year, we were using much more of our capacity maybe than someone else. I think that was the gist of your question, but it was really hard to hard to hear. And if I think you also had a question on Cheddar's? Yes, Sarah. Broken up again, but I think I caught most of it until the end. I think you were asking about the impact for Cheddar's and how we've improved margins that Cheddar's versus maybe the rest? And Gene mentioned. I think that was your question. So Gene mentioned that Cheddar's has had the biggest transformation in our business model. On an hourly labor basis that we said, we had about 350 basis points for Darden and proven an hourly labor, Cheddar's was close to three times that. And so it was a very big improvement at Cheddar's in their margin structure because of the simplification they did, and the work they've done. And the fact that they went from maybe less than 5% To Go sales to over 20 in a short period of time. And we think we'll continue to build that To Go volume. But Cheddar's did make the biggest transformation in their margin structure. And we think a lot of that will stick. I have triplets. I've interpreted mumbles a lot of time. Greg. Yes, I think it overweighs to other brands. I mean, we'll -- we should still see a little bit of margin prune at Olive Garden, just because the environments very different today than it was pre-COVID. And I think a lot of brands are out there, improving their margins in some way, shape, or form with simplification. And we just want to make sure our gap to the rest of the industry doesn't grow significantly. But we do believe that Olive Garden will see a little bit of margin improvement from where they were before. We just think that the improvement will come even greater in some of our other brands, Cheddar's and some of our other brands in the other segment. So I guess that would be then the industry on a year-over-year basis also for or the peers, it seems like it's a rising tide. They just haven't taken as much of a dip down. You know what we're comfortable to believe in somewhere between 5% and 15%. I think there's some other industry folks saying more than that, but I think 5 to 15. I think you remember once a restaurant, it's a restaurant. A lot of these will get recapitalized in the next few years, but I definitely believe that we'll be competing against less competition on the other side of this crisis. Yes, on the restaurant expense line, just want to give you a couple of titbits when we talked about business interruption of $10 million. That was a proceed that we got, that hit our restaurant expense lines. We did have some rent reductions in the quarter, a cash rent reductions were bigger than the P&L impact. The P&L impact was about $3 million. We had some most of our savings are in utilities, in smallwares, and repairs and maintenance. And we would expect that as dining room start to reopen as they get busy again, we'd have R&M start to increase, as well as small wares in utilities. Those savings are maybe not as permanent, right? Because those are just because their volumes are down. And another point to mention is, we are spending money on PPE for masks, for our team gloves, chemicals, etcetera. And that's about $4 million to $5 million a quarter. Yes. On the comp side, we mentioned about a year ago that we were going to start providing comps only at a segment level. And this was our first quarter that was the case. And so we're going to continue with that. Well, I think there is there is no cap. I mean, I think that, if you reach your -- you start to reach your capacity for just count, you have pricing power, and you can you can move your AUVs that way. I think pre-COVID, we were getting close to over $5 million on average unit volumes. So I think that, we'll definitely, hopefully you can get back there and get past that. I don't -- I don't ever think of a cap for a concept. Now we know that when you start adding new units, they're not going to come on at the average. Usually we can create a strong IRR with restaurants that that come in a little bit below the below the average and but overtime, we've been able to get that average to a pretty good level at 5 million."

We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today\u2019s discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing fourth quarter performance is a comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, this is because the results from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and 2020 are not meaningful due to the pandemic\u2019s impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during those periods. This will be the final quarter that we provide comparisons to pre-COVID. Moving forward, we will provide comparisons to the prior year. We plan to release fiscal 2023 first quarter earnings on Thursday, September 22 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and full year before discussing our focus moving forward. Raj will provide details on our Q4 and full year financial results and share our fiscal 2023 financial outlook and then Rick will close with some final comments. Now, I will turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. This is our first conference call since Gene\u2019s retirement, so I want to take a moment to thank him. Gene never wanted the spotlight on himself and he is probably listening right now and telling me to move on. But Darden is stronger today and better positioned to navigate any operating environment because of Gene\u2019s leadership. And personally, I know I am better prepared for my role, thanks to Gene\u2019s mentorship. So, on behalf of our 180,000 team members, thank you, Gene, for putting our guests and team members first and for leading Darden with a steady and decisive hand. As you saw from our press release this morning, we had a very good quarter, even in this highly inflationary environment. For the quarter, we exceeded our sales expectations and our earnings were in line with our outlook. Overall, fiscal 2022 was a solid year. Each of our brands strengthened their business models, while our restaurant teams remain disciplined and executed well in a challenging environment. We stuck to our strategy, continue to price below inflation and ended the year with significantly better margins than pre-COVID. As a result of this business model improvement and our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned as we begin our new fiscal year, in what remains an uncertain environment. Raj will share details for the quarter and the full year in a moment. But first, I want to spend my time reiterating Darden\u2019s strategy, which is not changing and will remain our focus moving forward. Our brands benefit from Darden\u2019s four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture, but none is more evident in our financial results than our scale. To quickly dimensionalize our scale advantage for you, our total sales are more than 2x our closest full-service restaurant competitor more than 2.5x the next closest. We also have higher than average annual restaurant volumes; lower overhead costs, which we achieved by centralizing our support functions and margins that are significantly higher than our competitive set. Our scale creates cost advantages that our brands could not achieve individually. A great example is the fact that each of our specialty restaurant brands: the Capital Grille, ADVs, Seasons 52, Yard House and Bahama Breeze, achieved record results for the year, even in the midst of historic inflation. We will continue to leverage our scale and our superior financial position to make long-term investments in our business. First, we will continue to invest in our brands\u2019 value propositions by underpricing inflation over the long-term. This is the biggest investment we make every year. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our scale to invest in technology that enhances the guest experience and simplifies operations. Finally, it is our people who bring our brands to life and we will continue to invest in them so they can grow and thrive and help us do the same. At the restaurant level, our strategy comes to life through our back-to-basics operating philosophy. This philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere, has never been more important than it is today. Our restaurant team is focused on being brilliant with the basics, ensures we put the full in full-service dining. The work our brands are doing to drive execution by simplifying our processes and menus puts our restaurant teams in the best position to deliver great guest experiences and its working. Olive Garden\u2019s overall guest satisfaction scores are at all-time highs. Additionally, on Mother\u2019s Day, the Olive Garden team delivered record performance. Mother\u2019s Day was the highest sales day and second highest guest count day in their history. We also continue to make key investments across our portfolio to position each brand for long-term success. For example, LongHorn Steakhouse has made significant investments over the past few years in the quality of their food. They continue to lead the casual dining industry on food quality and taste of food, which propelled them to over $2 billion in annual sales for the first time. Similarly, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen is a value leader and the investments they have made to simplify their menu and price below inflation has resulted in improvement in their industry-leading value ratings. Finally, as I mentioned, our specialty brands had record performance for the year, which was due to the investments they made during COVID and the scale advantage of Darden. Our strategy remains the right one for the company and we will continue to execute it to drive growth and long-term shareholder value. As we begin our new fiscal year, we continue to experience significant inflationary pressures and we will stick to our strategy of pricing below inflation and our competitors over time. While we can\u2019t predict the future, we are focused on managing the business for the long-term and the power of Darden positions us to navigate this environment better than anyone else. Now, I will turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion, 14.2% higher than last year, driven by 11.7% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 33 net new restaurants, which included one temporary closure that will reopen in fiscal 2023. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.24. Total EBITDA was $431 million and we returned significant cash to shareholders, paying $137 million in dividends and repurchasing $237 million in shares for a total of $374 million of cash returned to investors in the quarter. We continue to see increasing cost pressures with total inflation for the fourth quarter of 7.5%. During the quarter, we took additional pricing to help offset a portion of the growing inflation that brought total pricing to 6% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. This is well below our annual inflation of just over 6% as we continue to execute our strategy to strengthen our value leadership position. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L, compared to pre-COVID, food and beverage expenses were 300 basis points higher driven by investments in both pricing below inflation and in food quality. For reference, food inflation in Q4 was 12% versus last year. Restaurant labor was 40 basis points lower driven by hourly labor efficiencies gained from operational simplifications, which were partially offset by continued wage pressures. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7% versus last year, primarily driven by hourly wage inflation of approximately 9%. Marketing spend was $48 million lower as we remain disciplined in our approach to marketing activities, resulting in 230 basis points of favorability. G&A expense was 140 basis points lower, driven by our corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021 and sales leverage. As a result, we achieved restaurant-level EBITDA margin of 19.9%, 40 basis points above pre-COVID levels and quarterly EBITDA of $431 million. Total EBITDA margin for the quarter was 16.6%, a 170 basis point improvement to pre-COVID.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%. We ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $282 million, which was 10.8% of sales. All of our segments had higher total sales and higher average weekly sales per restaurant. Segment profit dollars were higher for all segments as well. Olive Garden and Fine Dining segments also grew their segment profit margin, while LongHorn and other business segment had lower segment profit margin this quarter, driven by higher level of inflation and other investments in those businesses since pre-COVID. Fiscal 2022 proved to be another unpredictable year. We experienced strong demand early in the year as capacity restrictions were largely removed. Additionally, we faced reduced demand and staffing challenges as the Delta variant emerged in the fall and the Omicron variant followed in December and January. Finally, inflation increased throughout the year. In fact, our total inflation doubled from our original expectation of 3% to just over 6% for the full year. Despite all of those challenges, we were able to deliver $9.6 billion in total sales and achieved diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.40, in line with our internal expectations and at the higher end of the annual guidance we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year. This year\u2019s strong top and bottom line performance drove over $1.5 billion in EBITDA from continuing operations, resulting in 15.9% EBITDA margin, nearly 200 basis points higher than pre-COVID. We also invested almost $400 million of capital in the business, returned over $1.6 billion to shareholders, and ended the year with $421 million of cash on the balance sheet. Our strong operating model generates significant cash flows. In fact, since 2017, we have averaged EBITDA growth of 9.5% annually. Our balance sheet is well situated at just 1.8x debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at the end of fiscal 2022, well below our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x and provides us flexibility for the future. The strong balance sheet, coupled with our disciplined approach to simplifying operations, under-pricing inflation and driving profitable sales growth, positions us well for the future. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023, we expect total sales of $10.2 billion to $10.4 billion, representing growth of 6% to 8% from last year, same restaurant sales growth of 4% to 6% and 55 to 60 new restaurants; capital spending of $500 million to $550 million; total inflation of approximately 6%, and we plan to continue under-pricing total inflation with annual pricing of approximately 5%. Furthermore, we expect commodities inflation of approximately 7% that\u2019s heavily weighted in the first half of the year; hourly labor inflation of approximately 8%; an annual effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%; and approximately 124 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.40 and $8. Heading into 2023, we expect the commodities inflation rate to increase in the first quarter from the 12% we had in Q4 and then to moderate significantly, ending the year roughly flat. So due to this significant unusual timing, we would like to provide some context on the cadence of quarterly earnings expectations. With the first quarter commodities inflation in the mid-teens, we expect a low double-digit percentage decline in EPS from last year. For the second quarter, commodities inflation eases a bit to the low double-digit range, resulting in flat EPS to last year. And for the back half of the year, we anticipate low single-digit commodity inflation and positive EPS growth. As a result of our strong performance and our fiscal 2023 outlook, our board approved a 10% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.21 per share, implying an annual dividend of $4.84. This results in a yield of 4.2% based on yesterday\u2019s closing share price. And with that, I will turn it back to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thanks, Raj. I want to close by thanking our team members in our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout a challenging year. As a publicly traded company, we strive to earn a profit and create long-term shareholder value. And while we are proud that our average annual total shareholder return has always been at least 10% for any 10-year period as a public company, there is a larger purpose to what we do and that is to nourish and delight everyone we serve. As a restaurant company, we continue to nourish our guests with delicious, high-quality food. But to us, it means more than that. We want to nourish the spirits of our guests to delight them with great service in an atmosphere that enables them to reenergize and connect with family and friends over a great meal. We also want to nourish and delight our team members by providing competitive wages and benefits while giving them opportunities to build meaningful careers within our company. With more than 1,850 locations and 8,000 leadership positions across our restaurants, we provide a pathway for thousands of people across the country to transform an entry level job into a lifelong career. Helping others realize their potential and achieve their dreams is one of the things that makes our industry special and that\u2019s why a central tenet of our approach to team member development is a commitment to promote from within. We are proud that more than half of our restaurant managers\u2019 positions are filled by our hourly team members. But their growth doesn\u2019t stop at the restaurant manager level. In fact, more than 15% of our officers began their careers with us as hourly team members. Finally, we want to nourish and delight the communities where we operate and our team members call home. When we open a new restaurant, we make a positive impact by creating an average of 100 new jobs and serving the local community. We aim to make a difference by helping tackle issues that we are best equipped to address, like fighting hunger and sourcing food with care. So our purpose, to nourish and delight everyone we serve is not limited to just sales and earnings growth, rather, it\u2019s about sales and earnings growth as a way to make a positive difference in the lives of millions more guests, tens of thousands more team members continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. Now, let\u2019s take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs.\nJared Garber: Hi, thanks for taking the question this morning. Obviously, I appreciate all the guidance that you provided. We are entering what maybe a more challenging macro environment. So just wanted to get a sense of, I guess, what are the underlying assumptions in your guidance on both the top line and the cost. I know you went through a couple of them on commodities and pricing. But as it relates to consumer spending maybe in the near-term, what you are seeing and then the outlook for the balance of the fiscal year. What are some of the assumptions underlying that guidance? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Jared. Good morning. This is Raj. Hey, look, this is our best estimate based on the data and information we have today. Obviously, like everyone else, there is a lot of uncertainty out there and you see that we have a wide range similar to last year to kind of reflect that underlying uncertainty. And with that said, we have shared information around commodities and what we estimate and we actually even provided the quarterly cadence on that front. And we are focused on things we control. And I actually want to have Rick chime in on the consumer, what we are seeing with the consumer and our expectations, high level.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Jared, I will start by saying the consumer sentiment right now is at the lowest it\u2019s been in 60 years, according to the University of Michigan. But one of the benefits of our portfolio is we have a wide range of consumers. Our data indicates that higher end consumer hasn\u2019t seen the same impact as consumers at the lower end of the spectrum and consumers at the lower end, especially at Cheddar\u2019s, has shown signs of check management and they do make up a smaller percentage of our current guest base than it is six months ago. So, the impact that inflation is having on that lower end consumers is showing a little bit, but we incorporated that in our guidance.\nJared Garber: Great. Thanks for that. And I guess just sort of one follow-up there. How do you think about sort of the tools that you have in the toolbox, if the consumer does slip a little bit more and maybe it\u2019s more than just that lower end at Cheddar\u2019s. But how are you thinking about some of the tools you have to maintain that higher level of sales growth as we go throughout the year, whether that\u2019s discounting or promotions? Obviously, you have done a lot of work in the last couple of years on limiting some of that, particularly at Olive Garden and LongHorn. So just want to get a sense of how you are thinking about the levers that you have to pull for the year? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Jared, for competitive reasons, we are not really going to get in too much into detail in our plans. But as you have seen over the last couple of years, our teams have done a great job being flexible and reacting to changing dynamics. We won\u2019t overreact. That\u2019s as you know, that\u2019s not really the way we work. We won\u2019t overreact. We are going to continue to focus on profitable sales growth and manage the business for the long-term. If the consumer slows dramatically, if we see a big slowdown in consumer traffic, we would also expect the rate of inflation to decline as well. And just to give you an idea, 1% decrease in the rate of inflation is more than offset, that is more, more than offset the 2% decrease in traffic. And so that should still help us get within the range of our guidance. As you think about our media message and what we are doing, Olive Garden\u2019s scale provides them the opportunity to use media to get our message out to many guests. That\u2019s one of the benefits of scale. We believe we can drive traffic by highlighting the value we provide everyday through an abundance of our never-ending first course. And if you look at our current media message right now, it speaks to one of our most craveable items, our Alfredo sauce that we make in-house everyday. It reinforces the core advertising and core equity at Olive Garden that we have invested in over the last 2 years and that ad is the highest rated ad we have had in years. And so our strong margins give us an optionality if we do promote, but we don\u2019t expect it to be at a deep discount. So, we do believe we have the tools in our toolbox to keep traffic at a better level in the industry, but we won\u2019t do things that will hurt us in the long-term for short-term benefit.\nOperator: We will now move on to our next question from Nicole Miller from Piper Sandler.\nNicole Miller: Thank you and good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the marketing spend embedded within guidance and also, more specifically, the message. I am thinking around Olive Garden, which has been about more about brand equity than any call to action in terms of price point. So what are you thinking in terms of marketing? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Hi, Nicole. We don\u2019t expect a significant increase in marketing, maybe within 10 basis points of what we had spent in 2022 as a percent of sales. As we look at Olive Garden, specifically, as Rick mentioned, we are focused on really further strengthening the core equities. So, the advertising, the messaging is going to focus on the brand equity, the never-ending abundance and any message that further enhances that is really what we are focused on. We don\u2019t see a need to do, like Rick said a deep discounted promotion there, but promotions that actually help elevate the brand equity.\nNicole Miller: And then just a follow-up and last question, what kind of staffing levels, I mean, I imagine at the two big brands pretty much, where you at, capacity is not the right word, but fully staffed, fully staffed? So what kind of staffing levels are embedded and how does labor inflate, if at all, in 2023? Thanks again.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Nicole, this is Rick. Right now, we have more managers per restaurant than pre-COVID. And so at the manager level, we are really well staffed. We are continuing to add new team members. But as I said, we have 180,000 team members now, which is what we had pre-COVID. So we\u2019re back to the level of our team member staffing from pre-COVID. That said, we still have pockets of restaurants that can improve their staffing levels, just like at pre-COVID. So we still have restaurants that could have a little bit more staffing level. But in general, we\u2019re staffed right where we were before COVID.\nRaj Vennam: And then just on the inflation, labor inflation hourly wage is around 8%, and total labor is somewhere around 6%ish is what we have embedded in the guidance.\nOperator: We will now move on to our next question from Jeff Farmer, Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.\nJeff Farmer: Great. Good morning. Thank you. So it looks like LongHorn\u2019s average weekly sales are up more than 25% versus pre-COVID levels. Olive Garden sales are up about 5%. I\u2019m just curious what your view is in terms of the factors that have contributed to that large gap in sales growth across the two concepts over the last couple of years?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Jared, this is Rick. Thanks for noticing how strong LongHorn\u2019s performance has been and the fact that Olive Garden is still up versus pre-COVID. I will start by saying, if you think about what we started at LongHorn and reducing the dependence on price point and promotions on advertising, we did that before COVID, and we had almost finished before COVID started. And throughout COVID, they continue to make significant investments in their food, and the quality of their food and have improved their overall execution in the restaurants. So they have had a great run of sales over the last couple of years versus pre-COVID because of the things that we did going into COVID and that we continued during COVID. Olive Garden started that process a little bit later, right? Olive Garden before COVID was still doing significant discounting and price-pointed promotions. We had started to wind off of some of those, but we still had quite a few of them. In addition, remember, we\u2019re significantly below our pre-COVID levels in marketing at Olive Garden. And that was driving some guest count that we think weren\u2019t as profitable as the guest counts that we\u2019re getting today. So the marketing that we\u2019ve done has helped. The marketing we\u2019re doing today is still driving some traffic, but it\u2019s driving the guests, our core guests that come to us because of the everyday value. And finally, I want to say Olive Garden\u2019s margins are really strong. So while their sales may not be as strong as pre-COVID as LongHorn, they have made a huge improvement in their business model and have the best margins basically in casual dining, which gives us flexibility to do the things we need to do going forward if we need to.\nJeff Farmer: That\u2019s helpful. And just a quick follow-up, you touched on this, but with that steep decline in consumer confidence, is there a relationship between that decline in consumer confidence and just sort of a softening of consumer health versus your job applicant flow, the pace of hiring, we just talked about staffing levels, but as the consumer comes under a little bit more pressure, has that actually been a little bit of a silver lining in terms of hire?\nRick Cardenas: Well, we\u2019ve seen our applicant flow growth grow over time, even before you started to see the decline in consumer sentiment. As the beginning of the fiscal \u2013 as the beginning of the calendar year started, we had mentioned in our last call that we have seen significant applicant flow, and that\u2019s helping us on kind of leveling off our wage inflation over time. But \u2013 So I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the exact relationship. But as consumer confidence wanes and maybe people feel a little less comfortable in an environment, they\u2019d be more likely to come back into the job market. And that would be a good thing for us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now move on to our next question from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just wondering if you can give us some color on the near-term comp trends just so we can assess that consumer sentiment slowdown, whether there was any change in trajectory by brand, perhaps through the fiscal fourth quarter into June, or change in purchasing patterns. I think you mentioned maybe a little bit of mix shift down at Cheddar\u2019s, but just wondering if you can give some color on other brands or as compared to traffic. Just trying to get a sense for whether there is any early indication across the broader portfolio of a sign of perhaps slowing consumer spending.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Jeffrey. I want to talk about the trends throughout the quarter. And if you think about our comps throughout the quarter, they stayed strong, and they actually continue to build from March, April to May. But the industry actually started to see some declines from March, April to May in same-restaurant sales. I want to be clear on the check and a little bit of the check management at Cheddar\u2019s, it\u2019s not dramatic. It\u2019s small. We\u2019re not seeing it at our other brands as much. Actually, we\u2019re not seeing it at our other brands. But I also \u2013 the point that I made about the mix of consumers at the lower end of the spectrum, that\u2019s across all of our brands. It\u2019s not just at Cheddar\u2019s. So it\u2019s across all of our brands. Just to give everybody some comfort about \u2013 not comfort, but just talk about the quarter, the industry sales have slowed from May to June. And we have seen that as well. But some of this might be a return to normal summer seasonality that we didn\u2019t see last year. As the dining rooms reopen and people felt more comfortable, we didn\u2019t see the normal seasonal patterns that we typically do. The industry comps do social softening, but quarter-to-date across our portfolio, we are exceeding the industry and we are within our annual guidance range.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just more broadly, as you think about full year \u201823, it seems like the midpoint of your earnings range would be maybe in the 4%ish range and then the dividend, you mentioned 4%. So 8% total shareholder return seems to be little bit below your 10% to 15% long-term target. I know you mentioned that over a 10-year period, you\u2019re proud to be consistently delivering within that range. But for fiscal \u201823, it doesn\u2019t seem to necessarily be sales-led considering what looks like strong comp growth in the assumptions. And your pricing of 5% is pretty close to the 6% inflation to protect the margins. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can give some color on where you see the shortfall, at least within your own guidance. Again, the sales seem to be strong and it seemed like you\u2019re pricing to protect the margins. So just whether it\u2019s just conservatism or just keen to give a wide range, just trying to get the assessment for where you see the potential earnings shortfall coming from?\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Jeff, look, we still believe that 10% to 15% is the right target long-term. But however, any given year, that might be different. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re choosing not to pass along all of our inflation to our guests and for a couple of reasons, right? We don\u2019t think all of this cost is permanent. For example, chicken, dairy and wheat, which are a significant portion of our basket, especially at Olive Garden, are highly \u2013 at a very high level right now. We don\u2019t believe that\u2019s very sticky for the long-term. And so we think it\u2019s prudent to be cautious and preserve flexibility rather than pass through these \u2013 some costs that may not be permanent. The other part of this is when you think about comp, our sales growth is mostly driven by the pricing. We mentioned that we have about 5% pricing for the year, and our guidance is 4% to 6% on SRS. So we\u2019re not assuming a significant traffic growth going into the year at the midpoint. And so I will just end by saying, we are really focused on the long-term, and we do not want to overreact to near-term pressures, even if that means that some short-term margin erosion are not able to get our long-term targets in any given year. That all being said, I mean we still have a pretty strong business model. Our margins are well ahead of where we were pre-COVID. Even in the guidance we provided, that implies margin improvement to pre-COVID.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from David Palmer from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Helpful color so far. You mentioned the high-income versus middle-income factor and might be \u2013 and that might be a differentiator in the trends and the pricing power lately and even that in the softness we\u2019re seeing through June. I wonder to what degree you think family-oriented visits, that larger party size paid by one person versus the closer to two people, per check is a differentiator as well and as a factor for the Cheddar\u2019s and the Olive Gardens versus the stake in Fine Dining lately?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, David, we haven\u2019t really seen a big difference in mix of families with family \u2013 larger families versus smaller families. But what we have seen in the Fine Dining is some of the urban markets are coming back a little bit. And we\u2019re seeing private dining coming back. So those are large parties, too. So they are not necessarily families, but they are large parties. The private dining is coming back in the urban markets in our higher-end brands. But we haven\u2019t seen a real shift down from our families going out to eat, even at Olive Garden Cheddar\u2019s, because family visit at Olive Garden and Cheddar\u2019s is still a lot less expensive than a family visit in other places. So we haven\u2019t seen that change very much.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you. And then just on food inflation guidance, the second half, how \u2013 what\u2019s your visibility there? How hedged and contracted are you? And I know you guys are proud of the fact that you guys have a good balance when you have weakness in the top line in the industry, oftentimes, you get some relief. So I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re maybe being less hedged in the second half to allow yourself if the industry does get softer to benefit from that in terms of your food costs, and I\u2019ll pass it on?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, David. So we are fairly well covered for the first half, but we are choosing to not cover as much for the back half, for we want to stay short given where the trends are and given what we think is likely to happen. So we want to preserve our flexibility should the environment get better on the commodities front. And so you saw that, I think, we shared this morning about 70% coverage for the first half, maybe a little bit north of 75% for the first quarter and the second quarter being closer to that 70% or just under. But we\u2019re fairly covered for the first half.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. Just a couple of quick ones. Are you seeing any regional differences in performance across the brands?\nRick Cardenas: Hi, Lauren, a little bit of regional differences, but it\u2019s really when we compare to prior year. And it\u2019s really driven by the fact that some parts of the country opened a lot faster last year than others. So we\u2019re seeing some pretty good performance in California because they didn\u2019t have a whole lot of growth last year. We\u2019re seeing some good growth in New England, which, again, was a little bit slower to reopen in the Pacific Northwest. But we are positive in all of our regions. It\u2019s just a little bit \u2013 quite a bit more positive in those that didn\u2019t open as fast last year.\nLauren Silberman: Great. And then just on on-premise versus off-premise, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing there at Olive Garden and LongHorn? Where is on-premise traffic running versus pre-COVID? Any color there would be helpful?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Without talking about traffic, I think traffic on to-go is a little bit different because of some of the catering. So we don\u2019t necessarily talk traffic as much as we do on sales. But if you look at our sales versus pre-COVID at both Olive Garden and LongHorn, our sales and to-go are much higher, and they are still higher. But in the fourth quarter, our traffic \u2013 our sales in to-go went down a little bit from the third quarter, partly because the third quarter had Omicron and our in-restaurant sales have actually continued to grow. So as our sales have gone down from Q4 to \u2013 Q3 to Q4, our in-restaurant sales have more than offset that. We\u2019re still seeing strong to-go performance across our two big brands and in Cheddar\u2019s as well. And Olive Garden is still above 25% to go for the quarter, and LongHorn is right at around 15%, which is much higher than they were pre-COVID.\nOperator: We will now take a question from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. I wanted to revisit how you would approach a downturn in consumer spending if we were to get one. And if I look back to the last major recession we had, Olive Garden clearly held up very well, and LongHorn did not hold up as well in terms of their sales performance. So wondering \u2013 I know that was early days in your ownership of LongHorn. I\u2019m wondering your specific thoughts on LongHorn and would pull for that brand this time around if we do get a downturn versus maybe what was the case last time.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, David, this is Rick. Thanks for that. If you think about where we were back in the last downturn, yes, we had just bought LongHorn not too long before that. So we\u2019re still going through integration, through the challenges of integration, and it was our first big acquisition. So there are probably more challenges than we have as we continue to move forward. And as you\u2019ve seen from every acquisition we\u2019ve made since then, we have some initial comp declines in doing so. Olive Garden performed very well for a couple of reasons. One is they are a trusted brand. And as consumers think about their spending during a time where they are minimizing their spending, they go to brands they trust. And that\u2019s something that typically happens in a recession or in something along those lines when people are really trying to figure out where to spend their hard-earned dollar. But Olive Garden was also pricing a little bit during that time. And we want to make sure that we don\u2019t get into that same situation, we overpriced and then run into a challenge a couple of years later, which is what happened with Olive Garden. So what I would also say is the steak category is a great value right now. If you think about what LongHorn has done over the last couple of years, as we\u2019ve said, they have increased the size of most of their steaks. They have increased the quality of most of their steaks, and they are executing their steaks better than they ever have. There is in-restaurant execution of steaks grilled correctly is at record highs for LongHorn. And so consumers see the value in what we put on the plate with cost of sales for every dollar they spend at a steakhouse, they get more food on the plate. So they are starting to see that a little bit better. I can\u2019t tell you what this \u2013 if there is a recession or a slowdown, what consumer is going to be impacted by that. But I can tell you that we\u2019ve done a lot of things over the last years and even since the last recession to strengthen our business models, to strengthen our brands so that we can react in whatever way we need to, depending on what happens. We feel really good about what Olive Garden has done, what LongHorn has done, what all of our brands have done to prepare for anything that could happen to us.\nDavid Tarantino: Great, thank you.\nOperator: We will now move on to our next question from Dennis Geiger from UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit more about any thoughts on the competitive environment this year or assumptions that you have. And if you care to weigh in sort of on whether a more pressured consumer should be a benefit for your business or maybe for larger chains in general just based on some of the commentary you\u2019ve made already. And I don\u2019t know if you want to opine here at all. But as it relates to delivery, given the cost there, in a more challenged environment, is that again something where you may maybe sort of underweight that channel versus some other larger brands, if that could potentially be a benefit for you as well if that\u2019s at all part of your consideration set, if you care away in any of that?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Dennis, this is Rick. The competitive environment is not the same kind of environment that we had before COVID. If you think about what a lot of our competitors have done is to bring in things to drive sales, third-party delivery, kitchens and those things, which actually maybe have done a little bit to hurt their margins. We\u2019ve simplified our operations to improve our margins over time. I think with the margin pressure and inflation pressure that others are seeing, it might be more challenging for someone to do some deep discounting to drive traffic. And so I think you might be right on to something here around if the consumer starts feeling more strapped, will they be willing to pay the kind of rates they have to getting food delivered or they would just decide to go pick it up. And if they do, we have what I believe is the best to-go pick-up experience in casual dining with the investments that we\u2019ve made in technology to make it easier to order, pick up and pay. And we keep making investments in those areas to make it easier for our guests. I think it was about 60% of our total to-go sales were digital, which equates to 10% to 12% of our actual sales completely, whether to-go or not. So we\u2019ve made some great investments to make it easier for our guests to order, pick up and pay. And if that means that the guests that we used to do delivery, in a downturn, they stop doing it, and they still want to get great food at home, they can get ours.\nDennis Geiger: Very helpful color, Rick. And I guess just one more as a follow-up on the technology piece. You touched on it then and I think during the prepared remarks, the focus and the investment in technology. Anything you would highlight as it relates to the biggest opportunities for this year on the tech digital side of things be it sales, maybe even some margin efficiency type of initiatives. Anything beyond you can kind of just framed out there? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Dennis. We continue to make investments in technology. Without getting into too much detail for competitive reasons, we continue to strengthen the consumer proposition and eliminate friction for our guests. And that\u2019s something big for us, is to take any friction the guest has out by incorporating technology that\u2019s not directly really in their face, but it takes friction out. But we\u2019re also doing a lot of investments to make the managers\u2019 jobs easier and our team members\u2019 jobs easier, which don\u2019t show up directly at the guest, but it does show up in better execution at the restaurants. So for example, we are using machine learning and AI to do forecasting at our restaurant, and that\u2019s significantly improving our forecast accuracy at the restaurant, so that managers can schedule better, schedule people and guests who are coming into the restaurant and order food more accurately and get food more accurately to reduce waste. So that should help on the efficiency side. But those are things that are kind of not first-level order driving traffic, but it\u2019s things that make our restaurant managers jobs easier, so they can spend more time with their team members to train them and more time with their guests to make them feel special so that people come back.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now move on to a question from Andrew Charles from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Charles: Great. My first question, Rick, is just around off-premise, that this is the fourth quarter now where you guys are running off-premise around a 25% to 30% sales range, holding on quite strong and quite sticky as the dine-in business rebounds. But before COVID, you guys were saying that Olive Garden could be a 20%-plus off-premise sales mix. Do you think just given the recent stickiness and strength of that, that it\u2019s more likely we will see this hang in around 25% plus?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Andrew. We are running at 25% plus now at Olive Garden. And we have said throughout COVID that we expect our off-premise sales as a percent to be higher than they were pre-COVID and probably higher than the 20%. We\u2019re still not quite at equilibrium yet. And we want to make sure that we get to equilibrium before we kind of give a new goal. But I will say that we expect it to be higher than it was pre-COVID, and we expect it to be higher than that initial kind of 20% goal, mainly because of the investments that we\u2019ve made, and what a great job our team members do to make sure that their guests get their food on time and it\u2019s accurate. Those are very important qualities for our to-go experience, and we\u2019re making some more investments for the guests to understand whether food is in the process and things like that to hopefully keep our To-Go business at the higher end of that range, while our dining rooms continue to build. But when we get to equilibrium, we will have a better idea.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thanks. And then can you guys compare kind of a historical target for 10% to 15% total shareholder return, just given that now we\u2019re seeing two consecutive years of top line in excess of that target and margins that are probably not going to make that 10 to 30 basis points expansion. Recognize that 10% plus is still the target here, how would you say the factors are going to be different, just given this is the second consecutive year of the dynamics that we are seeing.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. I mean, look, given the uncertainty environment this is probably no the best time to update the components of the framework. We still believe 10% to 15% is the right target. How we get there will vary year-to-year. And again, this is a long-term target. This is not a 1-year target. And so when we have a better \u2013 when we get to a better place, maybe use Rick\u2019s word of equilibrium, we will put something out there that incorporates all of that and our assumptions going forward that will lever the components of how we get to 10% to 15%.\nOperator: We will now take our question from Chris O\u2019Cull from Stifel.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Raj, can you help us understand how sensitive margin performance is to various levels of comp sales? And I would assume that relationship is not linear. So at what point do you see a meaningful margin degradation if you experience softness in consumer spending?\nRaj Vennam: Chris, I think I would kind of point back to the comment Rick made earlier about thinking about comp without the context of cost mix is not the best way to think. Because we think that they move in tandem, maybe there is a little bit of a lag. But if the consumer environment gets really soft, that should kind of make its way into inflation being less than we have and the cost pressures being less than we have. So, it\u2019s not a pretty straightforward linear equation. And obviously, I think what we say is you saw how our teams kind of remain flexible and figure out how to work through the environment, whatever environment we operate in. And so I will just reiterate that we are going to stay disciplined, and we are going to not overreact to near-term pressures, but focus on making sure we are making the right bets for the long-term and operate the best way we can in the environment that we are dealt.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Thank you. And then I had a follow-up on the commodity outlook. What\u2019s giving you confidence that you could see some relief in some of the key commodity costs beyond fiscal \u2013 the first half of the year or fiscal 1Q at least? Are there specific factors that you are aware of that make that scenario more likely, or is it driven by macro outlook for the consumer like you just mentioned that maybe that cooling demand helps commodity prices? Just trying to get some understanding or what gives you confidence you could see flat inflation in the back half \u2013 or in the fourth quarter?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Sure. So, here is what I think the way we think about it is, one, first of all, you got to remember the wrap on how high they were this year. Second quarter \u2013 I mean third quarter this year was 11% and the fourth quarter was 12%. And we are wrapping on those. And fourth quarter this year was wrapping on 4.5% a year ago. So, on a 2-year basis, when you look at where we were for the fourth quarter, we were about 16.5%, 17%. So, next year first quarter or this Q1 in FY \u201823, we are starting high. So, one, that\u2019s the dynamic that we take into consideration, right, where are the levels of pricing and what are we wrapping on. When you look at it through that lens, we expect that to get better. The second piece is we are starting to see, in some specific products, the price is breaking a little bit from the elevated levels they have been, right. So, whether it\u2019s beef that\u2019s come down a little bit, even chicken, for instance, is not at the highest levels it\u2019s been recently, so it\u2019s starting to come down a little bit. The other factor we have is what happens with the fall harvest on the grain side. So, we do expect, right now, we think from the information we have, better harvest season, and that should help a little bit with the grain. So, these are all factors we are taking into consideration. We don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but this is our best estimate at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. We will move on to our next question from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thank you and good morning. First, Rick, just on pricing on the 5%, can you just reconcile where you think the industry is on pricing? So, how much your pricing you think below not just inflation, but also your competitors\u2019. And just more broadly, how do you think about pricing on a portfolio basis? Are you pricing to each brand\u2019s relative inflation, or are you willing to take more pricing at certain brands where you just think there is more or less elasticity, so you get it. And therefore, we shouldn\u2019t think about it as a brand-to-brand, but as sort of on a portfolio basis. Is that how you think about pricing?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, John, I will answer the second part of your question, and I will give Raj to answer to the first part of the question. So, when you think about pricing across our portfolio, one of the biggest benefits of Darden is we have got a portfolio and we serve a lot of different consumers. And so our pricing will be different depending on the brand and depending on kind of the consumer that they serve. And so we would expect our pricing to be closer to inflation at the brands that can support that, which are more likely the brands at the higher end of the consumer spectrum, and our pricing to be below inflation at the brands that we want to protect their value. And those brands are more like the casual brands, specifically Olive Garden and Cheddar\u2019s, who have made significant business model improvement so that we can go ahead and take a little less pricing than inflation. So, that\u2019s the way we think about pricing. We look at the inflation rates those brands are seeing as well and see what kind of level of pricing we would like to take. But generally, generally, we would price our higher-end brands or more affluent consumer that can absorb some of that pricing and is a little less elastic than we would on the lower-end brands. And I will let Raj talk about the competitive pricing.\nRaj Vennam: Hey John, I will start with the broader macro overall FSR CPI. This is not new to you guys. You know this last published data from last month was 9% on a 1-year basis and over 12% or 13% close to on a 2-year basis. And then when you look at the breakdown of that, from what we understand, the chains are taking less than the independents. So, when we look at our closest competitors, they are probably close to that 6% range between 5% to 6%, depending on who you are looking at, but the average is closer to 6%. But then these are larger chains. But the small chains and independents is where you are seeing double-digit pricing. Again, that\u2019s the competitive intel we have. So, with that said, you asked a question about flexibility we have. I think part of what we have said all along has been that we want to be under pricing until we feel like certain things are permanent, and then we start to slowly increase that. We feel great about the pricing level that we have because, especially when you look at it versus where the overall industry is and where our nearest competitors are, we are better. And then actually we are even better when you look at it on a 2-year basis. And so really, that\u2019s kind of what drives us. But also, it does give us some flexibility should there be a need. And that\u2019s what we are trying to do is protect ourselves, preserve our flexibility. And if there is a need and if we feel like we can pass through some more, we will do that.\nJohn Glass: Thank you. What is the impact of inflation then on the build cost of new restaurants? Anecdotally, some smaller chains have talked about a pretty material increase in construction costs of new builds. So, what is your view on that in 2023? [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Kevin, I believe your line might be on mute.\nRaj Vennam: Sorry. Thank you. So, I was saying the construction costs, we are seeing about, call it, low-double digit increase in construction costs. And when we look at our overall returns, because of the business model improvements we have made through COVID, we are still getting pretty strong returns. In fact, I would argue, our returns are better today than they were even before COVID even with the increased construction costs because of the improved margins. With that said, we are starting to see the costs not continue to go up as much. So, we are starting to see that rate of change start to kind of plateau, if you will. And then what we are doing is trying to find opportunities to kind of do conversions that can help save a few hundred thousand dollars on a build, right, $0.5 million to $600,000 if we kind of take an existing shell and convert that. And so we have been doing some of that at our brands. So, we are trying to find ways to manage through that, but the costs are still pretty elevated.\nOperator: And we will now move on to our next question from Jon Tower from Citi.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks. I appreciate for taking the question. First, on the inflation side, I think we hit pricing quite a bit earlier, but I am curious to dive into the idea of during COVID, you were able to find quite a few productivity enhancements across the portfolio. And I am just curious to know if there is any more opportunity there should, say, inflation persists above and beyond what your expectations are currently for the year.\nRick Cardenas: Hey Jon, this is Rick. Yes, you mentioned that over the last few years, our brands have done a great job simplifying their operation and with significant productivity enhancements. We are going to continue to look for more. I will say, during the last year, we had significant training costs that, as we continue to ramp up people, we would hope that the training dollars would go down. It wouldn\u2019t be the same kind of level of productivity enhancements that we had before during COVID, but there should be some enhancements to help mitigate a little bit of the wage inflation, but not enough to offset the wage inflation.\nJon Tower: And then just following up, I think earlier in the call, you talked about the company\u2019s core competitive advantages and particularly highlighted the scale, and the company\u2019s balance sheet has some significant advantages versus the industry. So, I am curious how would you see yourselves taking advantage of that, particularly in an environment where you might see some closures of independents and/or some of your smaller competitors needing to slow down growth. I am just curious, in the past I believe you have used these slowdowns as an opportunity to find some of the best real estate in the industry. How are you thinking about taking advantage of a potential macro slowdown?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Jon, we continue to look for more real estate, especially if the macro environment slows down for the smaller competitors. I would say there are some industry estimates that, this coming up fiscal year will have no net unit growth. We are growing units. And so that could give us some more opportunities to find some sites. We have, I think we mentioned in our guidance, 55 to 60 new openings this year, which is a lot higher than the 37 net we had the year that just ended. And that we will continue to try to get more to that level of growth in units. And we have the balance sheet and the cash position to do that. And just as importantly, we have got the leadership pipeline that we have been developing to get people ready to open those restaurants. So, we feel like putting the \u2013 stepping the \u2013 putting our foot on the gas on unit growth, which is what we have always said, we have been saying that for a couple of years, is something we would do, but not to slam the accelerator down. We will continue to be measured in our unit growth and our goal would be to get to the higher end of our sales from new units in the framework that we had announced before.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Andrew Strelzik from BMO.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I will just ask one, and I wanted to follow-up on the food inflation and the coverage question, and I understand why you don\u2019t want to be as covered for the back half of the year. But the question is really about the ability to get coverage further out should you have wanted to go that route. Is that getting any easier with some of the broader demand uncertainties if you wanted to do that? Are those conversations or the asks to extend further out getting any better, even if that hasn\u2019t totally converged maybe with your expectations.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. I think it\u2019s the price certainty is the pace that is a little bit of an issue, right. When you talk to our \u2013 so the coverage, yes, you can get the product coverage, but we are trying to get a product coverage with price certainty. And that\u2019s where we still don\u2019t believe \u2013we are still not in a place where that is in a great place for the back half. As we look at what the suppliers think we should be paying and what we believe we should be paying, there is a disparity there. And that\u2019s really why we don\u2019t see it \u2013 we don\u2019t feel like we need to do anything right now and just have that optionality.\nAndrew Strelzik: But I guess the spread or with some of the demand uncertainties you have spoken about now, maybe some cracks here or there, maybe the view on the other side of that conversation isn\u2019t the same. But has the spread narrowed at all even if it hasn\u2019t converged all the way, or it\u2019s still kind of stayed the same?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, for sure. Yes. Things are \u2013 yes, the spread has narrowed, but again, our expectations are going down even more, right. So, I think that\u2019s part of the discussion here. So, it\u2019s not \u2013 yes.\nOperator: We will now take a question from Brett Levy, MKM Partners.\nBrett Levy: Rick, thanks for taking my question. Just going back on the development side, you talked about the willingness to grow and an ability to grow, but you also talked about not wanting to get too far ahead. Where do you see the greatest opportunities within the brands right now? And also just from a net flat growth environment out there and a strong balance sheet, how are you thinking about supplementing the current portfolio with additional brands? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Brett, we would like to see all of our brands continue to grow. At the more specialty brands, those sites are specific, and we want to make sure we have the great sites for them. So, it just depends on when a great site comes available. We may have some higher growth in 1 year and maybe a little bit lower growth in the next year. But for more casual brands, we would like to continue to see that ramp up versus the year before. And the fact that we are going from 37 to 55 to 60 should tell you that most of our brands are going to see an acceleration in unit growth. As it relates to your second part of your question on M&A, I will say that our biggest competitive advantage is what we talked about is our scale. And one way to build on that is to do an acquisition. And so we will continue to speak with our Board and use our strong balance sheet and our cash position to evaluate any alternative to allocate that capital. But we do believe that we have the ability to do both, to increase the number of units that we are building and to do M&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. Actually as a perfect follow-up to Brett\u2019s question, on the M&A side, I guess where are we in that spectrum? I mean you have announced $1 billion for buyback, which could presumably be used for M&A. You do have borrowing capacity, at least looking at what your investment-grade credit rating is. I mean in terms of, I guess Darden kind of being excited and being in the market and being proactive looking for things versus sellers that, in all reality, will have to accept the price for their business today that was very different than 6 months or 12 months ago. I mean I guess how maybe you want to talk about it in this term, hopefully, it\u2019s a fair question. I guess how close are we to a deal that really could matter relative maybe to some previous periods? How are the stars lining up or not lining up? Is that something could maybe get done in the near-term versus longer term? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Hi John, I can\u2019t tell you if we are closer or farther away from now versus where we were before. As equity prices move quickly and on the downward trend, so you got to get to what\u2019s a fair valuation level for the seller. And so I can\u2019t tell you if we are there yet or not. I can tell you that we will continue to evaluate, and we would like to continue to build our scale, and M&A is one way to do that. But when we do a deal, everybody will know. And we are always talking to our Board about M&A and the best ways to allocate our capital.\nJohn Ivankoe: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Peter Saleh from BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks. Very helpful call so far this morning, so thank you. Just wanted to come back to the conversation around the consumer, in the past recessions, I think you have seen a trade down at Olive Garden and some of the brands with trading down with fewer appetizers, desserts, strengths and maybe in some instances, consumers trading out of entrees into appetizers as their main meal. It doesn\u2019t sound like you have seen any of that at some of the core brands clearly at Olive Garden. I just want to confirm that. And two, Rick, I would just love to get your opinion on the probability of a recession or the consumer outlook, given where you sit and what you see in the environment right now?\nRick Cardenas: Hi Peter, to answer the first part of your question, we haven\u2019t really seen a lot of check management at any of our brands. We have seen a little bit at Cheddar\u2019s. But part of that is because they also introduced a great limited-time value stake, which might have mean people were trading away from appetizers to the stake on their menu, which is a T-bone, at a very great value compared to the competition. But we had seen some management of check at Cheddar\u2019s. In regards to the probability of a recession, I am not an economist. I can tell you what the economists are saying, and they are saying somewhere in the 40% range. At least some of them are saying that over the next 12 months. I can tell you, we will be prepared for that if and when it comes. I would hope to not see one. But if we do, we are going to be prepared. And I think we are better prepared than most of the people we compete with because of the margin differential that we have versus them and what we have done over the last few years to simplify our menus and what we have done to make sure our restaurants are fully staffed. And I would say one last thing is, if you think about our management turnover in our restaurants, it\u2019s significantly below the industry. So, they have seen more things than others have. Maybe they haven\u2019t seen a recession, but they have seen what happens when guest counts turn soft for even if it\u2019s a month, maybe others haven\u2019t. So, we are going to be better prepared, we believe, to handle. Plus, we have got great everyday value. You think about what we have done over the last couple of years in pricing below inflation and pricing below our competition, that means our value differential continues to grow. And we have got, I think what\u2019s a great place, we have got Olive Garden, which is an iconic brand that people trust that has improved our value. We have got Cheddar\u2019s, which we didn\u2019t have in the last time there was a recession, that\u2019s the value leader in casual dining. So, while I can\u2019t tell you what the probability of a recession is, I can tell you, I believe that we are well prepared to deal with whatever comes our way.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we will now move on to a question from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James.\nBrian Vaccaro: Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to circle back on your industry sales comment that you mentioned about June slowing a bit. Could you help us level set the magnitude of slowing that we have seen within casual dining over the last few weeks? It\u2019s just a little difficult of those, given the Father\u2019s Day shift, if you are trying to compare back to \u201819, also some differences in the year-on-year compares, I think moving through May and June as the industry recovered last year. So, any help there would be much appreciated.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Brian, when I talked about the kind of the sequential slowdown, it was versus prior year, so not worrying about pre-COVID. The only comment I had about pre-COVID was the seasonality differences. But you are right, Father\u2019s Day is something, but we are going up against the same week last year in Father\u2019s Day. So, Father\u2019s Day to Father\u2019s Day should have been the same. And we talk about magnitude, it\u2019s a couple of hundred basis points of the industry. It\u2019s not like the industry went negative completely, but it\u2019s closer to flat than it was before in the month of May.\nBrian Vaccaro: Okay. Great. And then circling back on the consumer, how do you break it down? You talked about the low income versus other income categories and seeing differences in behavior. Could you just update us on what percentage of your guests or sales are from the low versus middle or upper-income consumer for Olive Garden and LongHorn, however you kind of bracket that out?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail on the percent of our guests that are at the low end. The lower end consumer typically would be more of an Olive Garden consumer or Cheddar\u2019s consumer, more likely a Cheddar\u2019s consumer. And it makes up a portion of their guests, but not a majority of their guests. But the other thing is, remember, we have got a portfolio of brands that impact every segment of the economy and all the different economic stratifications of guests. So, we feel like we have got the ability to deal with whatever comes our way, as I said, and would \u2013 but don\u2019t want to give you the specific percentage of those consumers.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, as we have no further questions, that concludes our Q&A session today. And I would like to hand back to Kevin Kalicak for any additional or closing remarks.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you. That concludes our call. I would like to remind you that we plan to release our first quarter results on Thursday, September 22, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks again for participating in today\u2019s call. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that will conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.6 billion, 14.2% higher than last year, driven by 11.7% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 33 net new restaurants, which included one temporary closure that will reopen in fiscal 2023. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.24. Total EBITDA was $431 million and we returned significant cash to shareholders, paying $137 million in dividends and repurchasing $237 million in shares for a total of $374 million of cash returned to investors in the quarter. We continue to see increasing cost pressures with total inflation for the fourth quarter of 7.5%. During the quarter, we took additional pricing to help offset a portion of the growing inflation that brought total pricing to 6% for the quarter and 3% for the full year. This is well below our annual inflation of just over 6% as we continue to execute our strategy to strengthen our value leadership position. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L, compared to pre-COVID, food and beverage expenses were 300 basis points higher driven by investments in both pricing below inflation and in food quality. For reference, food inflation in Q4 was 12% versus last year. Restaurant labor was 40 basis points lower driven by hourly labor efficiencies gained from operational simplifications, which were partially offset by continued wage pressures. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7% versus last year, primarily driven by hourly wage inflation of approximately 9%. Marketing spend was $48 million lower as we remain disciplined in our approach to marketing activities, resulting in 230 basis points of favorability. G&A expense was 140 basis points lower, driven by our corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021 and sales leverage. As a result, we achieved restaurant-level EBITDA margin of 19.9%, 40 basis points above pre-COVID levels and quarterly EBITDA of $431 million. Total EBITDA margin for the quarter was 16.6%, a 170 basis point improvement to pre-COVID.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%. We ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $282 million, which was 10.8% of sales. All of our segments had higher total sales and higher average weekly sales per restaurant. Segment profit dollars were higher for all segments as well. Olive Garden and Fine Dining segments also grew their segment profit margin, while LongHorn and other business segment had lower segment profit margin this quarter, driven by higher level of inflation and other investments in those businesses since pre-COVID. Fiscal 2022 proved to be another unpredictable year. We experienced strong demand early in the year as capacity restrictions were largely removed. Additionally, we faced reduced demand and staffing challenges as the Delta variant emerged in the fall and the Omicron variant followed in December and January. Finally, inflation increased throughout the year. In fact, our total inflation doubled from our original expectation of 3% to just over 6% for the full year. Despite all of those challenges, we were able to deliver $9.6 billion in total sales and achieved diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.40, in line with our internal expectations and at the higher end of the annual guidance we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year. This year's strong top and bottom line performance drove over $1.5 billion in EBITDA from continuing operations, resulting in 15.9% EBITDA margin, nearly 200 basis points higher than pre-COVID. We also invested almost $400 million of capital in the business, returned over $1.6 billion to shareholders, and ended the year with $421 million of cash on the balance sheet. Our strong operating model generates significant cash flows. In fact, since 2017, we have averaged EBITDA growth of 9.5% annually. Our balance sheet is well situated at just 1.8x debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at the end of fiscal 2022, well below our targeted range of 2x to 2.5x and provides us flexibility for the future. The strong balance sheet, coupled with our disciplined approach to simplifying operations, under-pricing inflation and driving profitable sales growth, positions us well for the future. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023, we expect total sales of $10.2 billion to $10.4 billion, representing growth of 6% to 8% from last year, same restaurant sales growth of 4% to 6% and 55 to 60 new restaurants; capital spending of $500 million to $550 million; total inflation of approximately 6%, and we plan to continue under-pricing total inflation with annual pricing of approximately 5%. Furthermore, we expect commodities inflation of approximately 7% that's heavily weighted in the first half of the year; hourly labor inflation of approximately 8%; an annual effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%; and approximately 124 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.40 and $8. Heading into 2023, we expect the commodities inflation rate to increase in the first quarter from the 12% we had in Q4 and then to moderate significantly, ending the year roughly flat. So due to this significant unusual timing, we would like to provide some context on the cadence of quarterly earnings expectations. With the first quarter commodities inflation in the mid-teens, we expect a low double-digit percentage decline in EPS from last year. For the second quarter, commodities inflation eases a bit to the low double-digit range, resulting in flat EPS to last year. And for the back half of the year, we anticipate low single-digit commodity inflation and positive EPS growth. As a result of our strong performance and our fiscal 2023 outlook, our board approved a 10% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.21 per share, implying an annual dividend of $4.84. This results in a yield of 4.2% based on yesterday's closing share price. And with that, I will turn it back to Rick. Hey, Jared. Good morning. This is Raj. Hey, look, this is our best estimate based on the data and information we have today. Obviously, like everyone else, there is a lot of uncertainty out there and you see that we have a wide range similar to last year to kind of reflect that underlying uncertainty. And with that said, we have shared information around commodities and what we estimate and we actually even provided the quarterly cadence on that front. And we are focused on things we control. And I actually want to have Rick chime in on the consumer, what we are seeing with the consumer and our expectations, high level. Hi, Nicole. We don't expect a significant increase in marketing, maybe within 10 basis points of what we had spent in 2022 as a percent of sales. As we look at Olive Garden, specifically, as Rick mentioned, we are focused on really further strengthening the core equities. So, the advertising, the messaging is going to focus on the brand equity, the never-ending abundance and any message that further enhances that is really what we are focused on. We don't see a need to do, like Rick said a deep discounted promotion there, but promotions that actually help elevate the brand equity. And then just on the inflation, labor inflation hourly wage is around 8%, and total labor is somewhere around 6%ish is what we have embedded in the guidance. Hey, Jeff, look, we still believe that 10% to 15% is the right target long-term. But however, any given year, that might be different. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're choosing not to pass along all of our inflation to our guests and for a couple of reasons, right? We don't think all of this cost is permanent. For example, chicken, dairy and wheat, which are a significant portion of our basket, especially at Olive Garden, are highly \u2013 at a very high level right now. We don't believe that's very sticky for the long-term. And so we think it's prudent to be cautious and preserve flexibility rather than pass through these \u2013 some costs that may not be permanent. The other part of this is when you think about comp, our sales growth is mostly driven by the pricing. We mentioned that we have about 5% pricing for the year, and our guidance is 4% to 6% on SRS. So we're not assuming a significant traffic growth going into the year at the midpoint. And so I will just end by saying, we are really focused on the long-term, and we do not want to overreact to near-term pressures, even if that means that some short-term margin erosion are not able to get our long-term targets in any given year. That all being said, I mean we still have a pretty strong business model. Our margins are well ahead of where we were pre-COVID. Even in the guidance we provided, that implies margin improvement to pre-COVID. Yes, David. So we are fairly well covered for the first half, but we are choosing to not cover as much for the back half, for we want to stay short given where the trends are and given what we think is likely to happen. So we want to preserve our flexibility should the environment get better on the commodities front. And so you saw that, I think, we shared this morning about 70% coverage for the first half, maybe a little bit north of 75% for the first quarter and the second quarter being closer to that 70% or just under. But we're fairly covered for the first half. Yes. I mean, look, given the uncertainty environment this is probably no the best time to update the components of the framework. We still believe 10% to 15% is the right target. How we get there will vary year-to-year. And again, this is a long-term target. This is not a 1-year target. And so when we have a better \u2013 when we get to a better place, maybe use Rick's word of equilibrium, we will put something out there that incorporates all of that and our assumptions going forward that will lever the components of how we get to 10% to 15%. Chris, I think I would kind of point back to the comment Rick made earlier about thinking about comp without the context of cost mix is not the best way to think. Because we think that they move in tandem, maybe there is a little bit of a lag. But if the consumer environment gets really soft, that should kind of make its way into inflation being less than we have and the cost pressures being less than we have. So, it's not a pretty straightforward linear equation. And obviously, I think what we say is you saw how our teams kind of remain flexible and figure out how to work through the environment, whatever environment we operate in. And so I will just reiterate that we are going to stay disciplined, and we are going to not overreact to near-term pressures, but focus on making sure we are making the right bets for the long-term and operate the best way we can in the environment that we are dealt. Yes. Sure. So, here is what I think the way we think about it is, one, first of all, you got to remember the wrap on how high they were this year. Second quarter \u2013 I mean third quarter this year was 11% and the fourth quarter was 12%. And we are wrapping on those. And fourth quarter this year was wrapping on 4.5% a year ago. So, on a 2-year basis, when you look at where we were for the fourth quarter, we were about 16.5%, 17%. So, next year first quarter or this Q1 in FY \u201823, we are starting high. So, one, that's the dynamic that we take into consideration, right, where are the levels of pricing and what are we wrapping on. When you look at it through that lens, we expect that to get better. The second piece is we are starting to see, in some specific products, the price is breaking a little bit from the elevated levels they have been, right. So, whether it's beef that's come down a little bit, even chicken, for instance, is not at the highest levels it's been recently, so it's starting to come down a little bit. The other factor we have is what happens with the fall harvest on the grain side. So, we do expect, right now, we think from the information we have, better harvest season, and that should help a little bit with the grain. So, these are all factors we are taking into consideration. We don't have a crystal ball, but this is our best estimate at this point. Hey John, I will start with the broader macro overall FSR CPI. This is not new to you guys. You know this last published data from last month was 9% on a 1-year basis and over 12% or 13% close to on a 2-year basis. And then when you look at the breakdown of that, from what we understand, the chains are taking less than the independents. So, when we look at our closest competitors, they are probably close to that 6% range between 5% to 6%, depending on who you are looking at, but the average is closer to 6%. But then these are larger chains. But the small chains and independents is where you are seeing double-digit pricing. Again, that's the competitive intel we have. So, with that said, you asked a question about flexibility we have. I think part of what we have said all along has been that we want to be under pricing until we feel like certain things are permanent, and then we start to slowly increase that. We feel great about the pricing level that we have because, especially when you look at it versus where the overall industry is and where our nearest competitors are, we are better. And then actually we are even better when you look at it on a 2-year basis. And so really, that's kind of what drives us. But also, it does give us some flexibility should there be a need. And that's what we are trying to do is protect ourselves, preserve our flexibility. And if there is a need and if we feel like we can pass through some more, we will do that. Sorry. Thank you. So, I was saying the construction costs, we are seeing about, call it, low-double digit increase in construction costs. And when we look at our overall returns, because of the business model improvements we have made through COVID, we are still getting pretty strong returns. In fact, I would argue, our returns are better today than they were even before COVID even with the increased construction costs because of the improved margins. With that said, we are starting to see the costs not continue to go up as much. So, we are starting to see that rate of change start to kind of plateau, if you will. And then what we are doing is trying to find opportunities to kind of do conversions that can help save a few hundred thousand dollars on a build, right, $0.5 million to $600,000 if we kind of take an existing shell and convert that. And so we have been doing some of that at our brands. So, we are trying to find ways to manage through that, but the costs are still pretty elevated. Yes. I think it's the price certainty is the pace that is a little bit of an issue, right. When you talk to our \u2013 so the coverage, yes, you can get the product coverage, but we are trying to get a product coverage with price certainty. And that's where we still don't believe \u2013we are still not in a place where that is in a great place for the back half. As we look at what the suppliers think we should be paying and what we believe we should be paying, there is a disparity there. And that's really why we don't see it \u2013 we don't feel like we need to do anything right now and just have that optionality. Yes, for sure. Yes. Things are \u2013 yes, the spread has narrowed, but again, our expectations are going down even more, right. So, I think that's part of the discussion here. So, it's not \u2013 yes."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. This is our first conference call since Gene's retirement, so I want to take a moment to thank him. Gene never wanted the spotlight on himself and he is probably listening right now and telling me to move on. But Darden is stronger today and better positioned to navigate any operating environment because of Gene's leadership. And personally, I know I am better prepared for my role, thanks to Gene's mentorship. So, on behalf of our 180,000 team members, thank you, Gene, for putting our guests and team members first and for leading Darden with a steady and decisive hand. As you saw from our press release this morning, we had a very good quarter, even in this highly inflationary environment. For the quarter, we exceeded our sales expectations and our earnings were in line with our outlook. Overall, fiscal 2022 was a solid year. Each of our brands strengthened their business models, while our restaurant teams remain disciplined and executed well in a challenging environment. We stuck to our strategy, continue to price below inflation and ended the year with significantly better margins than pre-COVID. As a result of this business model improvement and our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned as we begin our new fiscal year, in what remains an uncertain environment. Raj will share details for the quarter and the full year in a moment. But first, I want to spend my time reiterating Darden's strategy, which is not changing and will remain our focus moving forward. Our brands benefit from Darden's four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture, but none is more evident in our financial results than our scale. To quickly dimensionalize our scale advantage for you, our total sales are more than 2x our closest full-service restaurant competitor more than 2.5x the next closest. We also have higher than average annual restaurant volumes; lower overhead costs, which we achieved by centralizing our support functions and margins that are significantly higher than our competitive set. Our scale creates cost advantages that our brands could not achieve individually. A great example is the fact that each of our specialty restaurant brands: the Capital Grille, ADVs, Seasons 52, Yard House and Bahama Breeze, achieved record results for the year, even in the midst of historic inflation. We will continue to leverage our scale and our superior financial position to make long-term investments in our business. First, we will continue to invest in our brands' value propositions by underpricing inflation over the long-term. This is the biggest investment we make every year. Additionally, we will continue to leverage our scale to invest in technology that enhances the guest experience and simplifies operations. Finally, it is our people who bring our brands to life and we will continue to invest in them so they can grow and thrive and help us do the same. At the restaurant level, our strategy comes to life through our back-to-basics operating philosophy. This philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere, has never been more important than it is today. Our restaurant team is focused on being brilliant with the basics, ensures we put the full in full-service dining. The work our brands are doing to drive execution by simplifying our processes and menus puts our restaurant teams in the best position to deliver great guest experiences and its working. Olive Garden's overall guest satisfaction scores are at all-time highs. Additionally, on Mother's Day, the Olive Garden team delivered record performance. Mother's Day was the highest sales day and second highest guest count day in their history. We also continue to make key investments across our portfolio to position each brand for long-term success. For example, LongHorn Steakhouse has made significant investments over the past few years in the quality of their food. They continue to lead the casual dining industry on food quality and taste of food, which propelled them to over $2 billion in annual sales for the first time. Similarly, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen is a value leader and the investments they have made to simplify their menu and price below inflation has resulted in improvement in their industry-leading value ratings. Finally, as I mentioned, our specialty brands had record performance for the year, which was due to the investments they made during COVID and the scale advantage of Darden. Our strategy remains the right one for the company and we will continue to execute it to drive growth and long-term shareholder value. As we begin our new fiscal year, we continue to experience significant inflationary pressures and we will stick to our strategy of pricing below inflation and our competitors over time. While we can't predict the future, we are focused on managing the business for the long-term and the power of Darden positions us to navigate this environment better than anyone else. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Thanks, Raj. I want to close by thanking our team members in our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout a challenging year. As a publicly traded company, we strive to earn a profit and create long-term shareholder value. And while we are proud that our average annual total shareholder return has always been at least 10% for any 10-year period as a public company, there is a larger purpose to what we do and that is to nourish and delight everyone we serve. As a restaurant company, we continue to nourish our guests with delicious, high-quality food. But to us, it means more than that. We want to nourish the spirits of our guests to delight them with great service in an atmosphere that enables them to reenergize and connect with family and friends over a great meal. We also want to nourish and delight our team members by providing competitive wages and benefits while giving them opportunities to build meaningful careers within our company. With more than 1,850 locations and 8,000 leadership positions across our restaurants, we provide a pathway for thousands of people across the country to transform an entry level job into a lifelong career. Helping others realize their potential and achieve their dreams is one of the things that makes our industry special and that's why a central tenet of our approach to team member development is a commitment to promote from within. We are proud that more than half of our restaurant managers' positions are filled by our hourly team members. But their growth doesn't stop at the restaurant manager level. In fact, more than 15% of our officers began their careers with us as hourly team members. Finally, we want to nourish and delight the communities where we operate and our team members call home. When we open a new restaurant, we make a positive impact by creating an average of 100 new jobs and serving the local community. We aim to make a difference by helping tackle issues that we are best equipped to address, like fighting hunger and sourcing food with care. So our purpose, to nourish and delight everyone we serve is not limited to just sales and earnings growth, rather, it's about sales and earnings growth as a way to make a positive difference in the lives of millions more guests, tens of thousands more team members continue to create long-term value for our shareholders. Now, let's take your questions. Hey, Jared, I will start by saying the consumer sentiment right now is at the lowest it's been in 60 years, according to the University of Michigan. But one of the benefits of our portfolio is we have a wide range of consumers. Our data indicates that higher end consumer hasn't seen the same impact as consumers at the lower end of the spectrum and consumers at the lower end, especially at Cheddar's, has shown signs of check management and they do make up a smaller percentage of our current guest base than it is six months ago. So, the impact that inflation is having on that lower end consumers is showing a little bit, but we incorporated that in our guidance. Yes, Jared, for competitive reasons, we are not really going to get in too much into detail in our plans. But as you have seen over the last couple of years, our teams have done a great job being flexible and reacting to changing dynamics. We won't overreact. That's as you know, that's not really the way we work. We won't overreact. We are going to continue to focus on profitable sales growth and manage the business for the long-term. If the consumer slows dramatically, if we see a big slowdown in consumer traffic, we would also expect the rate of inflation to decline as well. And just to give you an idea, 1% decrease in the rate of inflation is more than offset, that is more, more than offset the 2% decrease in traffic. And so that should still help us get within the range of our guidance. As you think about our media message and what we are doing, Olive Garden's scale provides them the opportunity to use media to get our message out to many guests. That's one of the benefits of scale. We believe we can drive traffic by highlighting the value we provide everyday through an abundance of our never-ending first course. And if you look at our current media message right now, it speaks to one of our most craveable items, our Alfredo sauce that we make in-house everyday. It reinforces the core advertising and core equity at Olive Garden that we have invested in over the last 2 years and that ad is the highest rated ad we have had in years. And so our strong margins give us an optionality if we do promote, but we don't expect it to be at a deep discount. So, we do believe we have the tools in our toolbox to keep traffic at a better level in the industry, but we won't do things that will hurt us in the long-term for short-term benefit. Yes, Nicole, this is Rick. Right now, we have more managers per restaurant than pre-COVID. And so at the manager level, we are really well staffed. We are continuing to add new team members. But as I said, we have 180,000 team members now, which is what we had pre-COVID. So we're back to the level of our team member staffing from pre-COVID. That said, we still have pockets of restaurants that can improve their staffing levels, just like at pre-COVID. So we still have restaurants that could have a little bit more staffing level. But in general, we're staffed right where we were before COVID. Hey, Jared, this is Rick. Thanks for noticing how strong LongHorn's performance has been and the fact that Olive Garden is still up versus pre-COVID. I will start by saying, if you think about what we started at LongHorn and reducing the dependence on price point and promotions on advertising, we did that before COVID, and we had almost finished before COVID started. And throughout COVID, they continue to make significant investments in their food, and the quality of their food and have improved their overall execution in the restaurants. So they have had a great run of sales over the last couple of years versus pre-COVID because of the things that we did going into COVID and that we continued during COVID. Olive Garden started that process a little bit later, right? Olive Garden before COVID was still doing significant discounting and price-pointed promotions. We had started to wind off of some of those, but we still had quite a few of them. In addition, remember, we're significantly below our pre-COVID levels in marketing at Olive Garden. And that was driving some guest count that we think weren't as profitable as the guest counts that we're getting today. So the marketing that we've done has helped. The marketing we're doing today is still driving some traffic, but it's driving the guests, our core guests that come to us because of the everyday value. And finally, I want to say Olive Garden's margins are really strong. So while their sales may not be as strong as pre-COVID as LongHorn, they have made a huge improvement in their business model and have the best margins basically in casual dining, which gives us flexibility to do the things we need to do going forward if we need to. Well, we've seen our applicant flow growth grow over time, even before you started to see the decline in consumer sentiment. As the beginning of the fiscal \u2013 as the beginning of the calendar year started, we had mentioned in our last call that we have seen significant applicant flow, and that's helping us on kind of leveling off our wage inflation over time. But \u2013 So I don't \u2013 I'm not saying that's the exact relationship. But as consumer confidence wanes and maybe people feel a little less comfortable in an environment, they'd be more likely to come back into the job market. And that would be a good thing for us. Yes, Jeffrey. I want to talk about the trends throughout the quarter. And if you think about our comps throughout the quarter, they stayed strong, and they actually continue to build from March, April to May. But the industry actually started to see some declines from March, April to May in same-restaurant sales. I want to be clear on the check and a little bit of the check management at Cheddar's, it's not dramatic. It's small. We're not seeing it at our other brands as much. Actually, we're not seeing it at our other brands. But I also \u2013 the point that I made about the mix of consumers at the lower end of the spectrum, that's across all of our brands. It's not just at Cheddar's. So it's across all of our brands. Just to give everybody some comfort about \u2013 not comfort, but just talk about the quarter, the industry sales have slowed from May to June. And we have seen that as well. But some of this might be a return to normal summer seasonality that we didn't see last year. As the dining rooms reopen and people felt more comfortable, we didn't see the normal seasonal patterns that we typically do. The industry comps do social softening, but quarter-to-date across our portfolio, we are exceeding the industry and we are within our annual guidance range. Yes, David, we haven't really seen a big difference in mix of families with family \u2013 larger families versus smaller families. But what we have seen in the Fine Dining is some of the urban markets are coming back a little bit. And we're seeing private dining coming back. So those are large parties, too. So they are not necessarily families, but they are large parties. The private dining is coming back in the urban markets in our higher-end brands. But we haven't seen a real shift down from our families going out to eat, even at Olive Garden Cheddar's, because family visit at Olive Garden and Cheddar's is still a lot less expensive than a family visit in other places. So we haven't seen that change very much. Hi, Lauren, a little bit of regional differences, but it's really when we compare to prior year. And it's really driven by the fact that some parts of the country opened a lot faster last year than others. So we're seeing some pretty good performance in California because they didn't have a whole lot of growth last year. We're seeing some good growth in New England, which, again, was a little bit slower to reopen in the Pacific Northwest. But we are positive in all of our regions. It's just a little bit \u2013 quite a bit more positive in those that didn't open as fast last year. Yes. Without talking about traffic, I think traffic on to-go is a little bit different because of some of the catering. So we don't necessarily talk traffic as much as we do on sales. But if you look at our sales versus pre-COVID at both Olive Garden and LongHorn, our sales and to-go are much higher, and they are still higher. But in the fourth quarter, our traffic \u2013 our sales in to-go went down a little bit from the third quarter, partly because the third quarter had Omicron and our in-restaurant sales have actually continued to grow. So as our sales have gone down from Q4 to \u2013 Q3 to Q4, our in-restaurant sales have more than offset that. We're still seeing strong to-go performance across our two big brands and in Cheddar's as well. And Olive Garden is still above 25% to go for the quarter, and LongHorn is right at around 15%, which is much higher than they were pre-COVID. Yes, David, this is Rick. Thanks for that. If you think about where we were back in the last downturn, yes, we had just bought LongHorn not too long before that. So we're still going through integration, through the challenges of integration, and it was our first big acquisition. So there are probably more challenges than we have as we continue to move forward. And as you've seen from every acquisition we've made since then, we have some initial comp declines in doing so. Olive Garden performed very well for a couple of reasons. One is they are a trusted brand. And as consumers think about their spending during a time where they are minimizing their spending, they go to brands they trust. And that's something that typically happens in a recession or in something along those lines when people are really trying to figure out where to spend their hard-earned dollar. But Olive Garden was also pricing a little bit during that time. And we want to make sure that we don't get into that same situation, we overpriced and then run into a challenge a couple of years later, which is what happened with Olive Garden. So what I would also say is the steak category is a great value right now. If you think about what LongHorn has done over the last couple of years, as we've said, they have increased the size of most of their steaks. They have increased the quality of most of their steaks, and they are executing their steaks better than they ever have. There is in-restaurant execution of steaks grilled correctly is at record highs for LongHorn. And so consumers see the value in what we put on the plate with cost of sales for every dollar they spend at a steakhouse, they get more food on the plate. So they are starting to see that a little bit better. I can't tell you what this \u2013 if there is a recession or a slowdown, what consumer is going to be impacted by that. But I can tell you that we've done a lot of things over the last years and even since the last recession to strengthen our business models, to strengthen our brands so that we can react in whatever way we need to, depending on what happens. We feel really good about what Olive Garden has done, what LongHorn has done, what all of our brands have done to prepare for anything that could happen to us. Yes, Dennis, this is Rick. The competitive environment is not the same kind of environment that we had before COVID. If you think about what a lot of our competitors have done is to bring in things to drive sales, third-party delivery, kitchens and those things, which actually maybe have done a little bit to hurt their margins. We've simplified our operations to improve our margins over time. I think with the margin pressure and inflation pressure that others are seeing, it might be more challenging for someone to do some deep discounting to drive traffic. And so I think you might be right on to something here around if the consumer starts feeling more strapped, will they be willing to pay the kind of rates they have to getting food delivered or they would just decide to go pick it up. And if they do, we have what I believe is the best to-go pick-up experience in casual dining with the investments that we've made in technology to make it easier to order, pick up and pay. And we keep making investments in those areas to make it easier for our guests. I think it was about 60% of our total to-go sales were digital, which equates to 10% to 12% of our actual sales completely, whether to-go or not. So we've made some great investments to make it easier for our guests to order, pick up and pay. And if that means that the guests that we used to do delivery, in a downturn, they stop doing it, and they still want to get great food at home, they can get ours. Yes, Dennis. We continue to make investments in technology. Without getting into too much detail for competitive reasons, we continue to strengthen the consumer proposition and eliminate friction for our guests. And that's something big for us, is to take any friction the guest has out by incorporating technology that's not directly really in their face, but it takes friction out. But we're also doing a lot of investments to make the managers' jobs easier and our team members' jobs easier, which don't show up directly at the guest, but it does show up in better execution at the restaurants. So for example, we are using machine learning and AI to do forecasting at our restaurant, and that's significantly improving our forecast accuracy at the restaurant, so that managers can schedule better, schedule people and guests who are coming into the restaurant and order food more accurately and get food more accurately to reduce waste. So that should help on the efficiency side. But those are things that are kind of not first-level order driving traffic, but it's things that make our restaurant managers jobs easier, so they can spend more time with their team members to train them and more time with their guests to make them feel special so that people come back. Yes, Andrew. We are running at 25% plus now at Olive Garden. And we have said throughout COVID that we expect our off-premise sales as a percent to be higher than they were pre-COVID and probably higher than the 20%. We're still not quite at equilibrium yet. And we want to make sure that we get to equilibrium before we kind of give a new goal. But I will say that we expect it to be higher than it was pre-COVID, and we expect it to be higher than that initial kind of 20% goal, mainly because of the investments that we've made, and what a great job our team members do to make sure that their guests get their food on time and it's accurate. Those are very important qualities for our to-go experience, and we're making some more investments for the guests to understand whether food is in the process and things like that to hopefully keep our To-Go business at the higher end of that range, while our dining rooms continue to build. But when we get to equilibrium, we will have a better idea. Yes, John, I will answer the second part of your question, and I will give Raj to answer to the first part of the question. So, when you think about pricing across our portfolio, one of the biggest benefits of Darden is we have got a portfolio and we serve a lot of different consumers. And so our pricing will be different depending on the brand and depending on kind of the consumer that they serve. And so we would expect our pricing to be closer to inflation at the brands that can support that, which are more likely the brands at the higher end of the consumer spectrum, and our pricing to be below inflation at the brands that we want to protect their value. And those brands are more like the casual brands, specifically Olive Garden and Cheddar's, who have made significant business model improvement so that we can go ahead and take a little less pricing than inflation. So, that's the way we think about pricing. We look at the inflation rates those brands are seeing as well and see what kind of level of pricing we would like to take. But generally, generally, we would price our higher-end brands or more affluent consumer that can absorb some of that pricing and is a little less elastic than we would on the lower-end brands. And I will let Raj talk about the competitive pricing. Hey Jon, this is Rick. Yes, you mentioned that over the last few years, our brands have done a great job simplifying their operation and with significant productivity enhancements. We are going to continue to look for more. I will say, during the last year, we had significant training costs that, as we continue to ramp up people, we would hope that the training dollars would go down. It wouldn't be the same kind of level of productivity enhancements that we had before during COVID, but there should be some enhancements to help mitigate a little bit of the wage inflation, but not enough to offset the wage inflation. Yes, Jon, we continue to look for more real estate, especially if the macro environment slows down for the smaller competitors. I would say there are some industry estimates that, this coming up fiscal year will have no net unit growth. We are growing units. And so that could give us some more opportunities to find some sites. We have, I think we mentioned in our guidance, 55 to 60 new openings this year, which is a lot higher than the 37 net we had the year that just ended. And that we will continue to try to get more to that level of growth in units. And we have the balance sheet and the cash position to do that. And just as importantly, we have got the leadership pipeline that we have been developing to get people ready to open those restaurants. So, we feel like putting the \u2013 stepping the \u2013 putting our foot on the gas on unit growth, which is what we have always said, we have been saying that for a couple of years, is something we would do, but not to slam the accelerator down. We will continue to be measured in our unit growth and our goal would be to get to the higher end of our sales from new units in the framework that we had announced before. Yes. Brett, we would like to see all of our brands continue to grow. At the more specialty brands, those sites are specific, and we want to make sure we have the great sites for them. So, it just depends on when a great site comes available. We may have some higher growth in 1 year and maybe a little bit lower growth in the next year. But for more casual brands, we would like to continue to see that ramp up versus the year before. And the fact that we are going from 37 to 55 to 60 should tell you that most of our brands are going to see an acceleration in unit growth. As it relates to your second part of your question on M&A, I will say that our biggest competitive advantage is what we talked about is our scale. And one way to build on that is to do an acquisition. And so we will continue to speak with our Board and use our strong balance sheet and our cash position to evaluate any alternative to allocate that capital. But we do believe that we have the ability to do both, to increase the number of units that we are building and to do M&A. Hi John, I can't tell you if we are closer or farther away from now versus where we were before. As equity prices move quickly and on the downward trend, so you got to get to what's a fair valuation level for the seller. And so I can't tell you if we are there yet or not. I can tell you that we will continue to evaluate, and we would like to continue to build our scale, and M&A is one way to do that. But when we do a deal, everybody will know. And we are always talking to our Board about M&A and the best ways to allocate our capital. Hi Peter, to answer the first part of your question, we haven't really seen a lot of check management at any of our brands. We have seen a little bit at Cheddar's. But part of that is because they also introduced a great limited-time value stake, which might have mean people were trading away from appetizers to the stake on their menu, which is a T-bone, at a very great value compared to the competition. But we had seen some management of check at Cheddar's. In regards to the probability of a recession, I am not an economist. I can tell you what the economists are saying, and they are saying somewhere in the 40% range. At least some of them are saying that over the next 12 months. I can tell you, we will be prepared for that if and when it comes. I would hope to not see one. But if we do, we are going to be prepared. And I think we are better prepared than most of the people we compete with because of the margin differential that we have versus them and what we have done over the last few years to simplify our menus and what we have done to make sure our restaurants are fully staffed. And I would say one last thing is, if you think about our management turnover in our restaurants, it's significantly below the industry. So, they have seen more things than others have. Maybe they haven't seen a recession, but they have seen what happens when guest counts turn soft for even if it's a month, maybe others haven't. So, we are going to be better prepared, we believe, to handle. Plus, we have got great everyday value. You think about what we have done over the last couple of years in pricing below inflation and pricing below our competition, that means our value differential continues to grow. And we have got, I think what's a great place, we have got Olive Garden, which is an iconic brand that people trust that has improved our value. We have got Cheddar's, which we didn't have in the last time there was a recession, that's the value leader in casual dining. So, while I can't tell you what the probability of a recession is, I can tell you, I believe that we are well prepared to deal with whatever comes our way. Yes, Brian, when I talked about the kind of the sequential slowdown, it was versus prior year, so not worrying about pre-COVID. The only comment I had about pre-COVID was the seasonality differences. But you are right, Father's Day is something, but we are going up against the same week last year in Father's Day. So, Father's Day to Father's Day should have been the same. And we talk about magnitude, it's a couple of hundred basis points of the industry. It's not like the industry went negative completely, but it's closer to flat than it was before in the month of May. Yes. I don't want to get into too much detail on the percent of our guests that are at the low end. The lower end consumer typically would be more of an Olive Garden consumer or Cheddar's consumer, more likely a Cheddar's consumer. And it makes up a portion of their guests, but not a majority of their guests. But the other thing is, remember, we have got a portfolio of brands that impact every segment of the economy and all the different economic stratifications of guests. So, we feel like we have got the ability to deal with whatever comes our way, as I said, and would \u2013 but don't want to give you the specific percentage of those consumers."

[Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Jess, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, President and COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing third quarter performance is a comparison to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. This is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic's impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during the third quarter of fiscal 2021. We plan to release fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, June 23, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks, Rick will give an update on our operating performance, Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2022 financial outlook, and then Gene will have some closing comments. Now, I'll turn the call over to Gene.\nGene Lee: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter was one of stark contrast, and I'm pleased with our performance in this highly volatile environment. Our team did a great job controlling what they could control. In fiscal December, we achieved record sales while meeting our internal profit expectations that were contemplated in the guidance we provided in December. However, in fiscal January, which is a high-volume period for us, the Omicron variant significantly impacted consumer demand, restaurant staffing and operating expenses. We also experienced substantial weather impacts, all of which resulted in significantly lower sales and earnings than our internal expectations. Finally, as COVID cases declined and the operating environment normalized, sales improved throughout fiscal February, and we had strong results that exceeded our internal expectations. Sales strength has continued into March. Quarter-to-date, our average weekly sales are slightly ahead of our February actuals, and these trends are incorporated in our guidance. When we talked last in December, we could not have predicted the impacts Omicron would have on our business. In fact, the dramatic spike in cases create the most difficult operating environment since the initial onset of COVID two years ago. Rick will provide more details on the impact it had on our staffing levels in a moment. Omicron also created additional pressure on expenses at the restaurant level as we saw higher levels of sick pay and we incurred significant overtime costs due to staffing shortages caused by exclusions. The January spike also caused further supply chain disruptions, and we now expect inflation to be higher in Q4 than when we talked in December. We have implemented pricing actions to mitigate the impacts of rising costs, and Raj will provide more detail in his remarks. We recognize that all of us in the industry faced additional risk due to the current geopolitical environment such as higher inflation and further supply chain disruptions. However, I'm confident that Darden can compete effectively in any operating environment. We have a strong balance sheet and the right strategy in place, driven by our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented culture. And our brands are relentlessly focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service, and atmosphere. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thanks Gene and good morning, everyone. Our restaurant teams are focused on executing at the highest level in creating exceptional experiences for every one of our guests. That's why we are committed to doing what it takes to have the people we need and the products our guests expect when they choose to dine with us. From a people perspective, we are seeing positive momentum in applicant numbers, and we feel much better about where we are now in terms of overall staffing. Our focus will continue to be on hiring and more importantly, training our new team members to reach the productivity level required to enable us to operate at optimum staffing levels. Our biggest staffing challenge during the quarter was managing the impacts of team member and manager exclusions due to Omicron. To provide some context, at the peak, team member exclusions in January were three times higher than the monthly peak we experienced with Delta. While we did get some help as the CDC guidelines for exclusion were reduced from 10 to five days, 8% of our total workforce was excluded at some point during January. To put a finer point on this, in the month of January, we had over 13,000 team members excluded for a total of more than 65,000 exclusion days. I am really proud of how our teams managed through the impacts of Omicron. As it moved across the country, we had some restaurants that were down as much as 40% of their staff and others that needed to limit their hours were temporarily moved to takeout only in order to operate effectively. As Omicron began to fade, our teams kept the same level of focus on staffing and training to provide a great guest experience, which resulted in record sales for fiscal February. Valentine's Day was strong across all our brands, and that is a testament to the excellent job our operators are doing to ensure their restaurants are staffed and ready to serve our guests. In fact, on Valentine's Day, Olive Garden served more than 1 million guests with approximately 35% of sales off-premise. On the product side, our supply chain team is working hard leveraging our scale to ensure our restaurants have the products they need to serve our guests. Our inventory levels remained strong and some of the logistical challenges we had been dealing with began to improve in December. However, Omicron impacted staffing for our supply chain partners in January as well. For labor intensive food production, this resulted in reduced supply and increased cost at a time when protein prices typically shift down from the heavy holiday buying season. Our distribution partners also experienced warehouse staffing challenges and driver shortages. Thus, we had expedited shipping costs and utilized more spot rate haulers in the quarter. Between those impacts and dealing with back-to-back winter storms, our team did an admirable job of maintaining supply continuity for our restaurants. Together, all of these factors increased our expected annual inflation, and Raj will provide more color on that in a moment. To Go sales remained strong during the quarter as our brand and our guests continue to benefit from the strength of our digital platform. Off-premise sales accounted for 30% of total sales at Olive Garden and 16% of total sales at Longhorn Steakhouse. Digital transactions accounted for 63% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 12% of Darden's total sales. Before I turn it over to Raj, I want to thank all of our team members who have shown tremendous resiliency and dedication in the face of constant change. Two years ago, we closed our dining room and did not know when we would be able to reopen them. Since then, we have dealt with multiple COVID waves, and our teams continue to demonstrate incredible flexibility and perseverance while creating exceptional guest experiences. Today, we are hopeful that we are near the end of the COVID-19 as a pandemic and that we will be able to live with like we do with other viruses. As I visit our restaurants and talk with our team members, they say each day feels a little more normal, and they are invigorated by the energy that has returned to our dining room. Our team members are the best in the business. I'm inspired by their winning spirit and confident that Darden's best days are ahead of us. Now I'll turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results for the quarter, I want to expand on Gene and Rick's comments regarding the impact of Omicron and winter weather on our third quarter results. When looking at the fiscal months, actual sales for December and February were close to our internal expectations that were contemplated in the financial outlook we provided in December. And we met our profitability expectations in December and exceeded them in February. In fiscal January, however, we were significantly below our sales and profitability expectations as COVID cases surged, causing increased staffing shortages and reduced demand. We also experienced more severe winter weather than historical averages. As a result, sales were negatively impacted by over $100 million. This sales slowdown coupled with additional expenses related to sick pay, overtime and increased inflation, negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.30 and was more than 100 basis points drag on EBITDA margins for this quarter. Now turning to the detailed results for the quarter. Total sales for third quarter were $2.4 billion, 41% higher than last year, driven by 38% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 33 net new restaurants. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.93. Total EBITDA was $395 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 16.1%, 50 basis points better than pre-COVID. We continue to return significant cash to shareholders, paying $141 million in dividends and repurchasing $382 million in shares for a total of over $520 million cash returned to investors in the quarter. We ended the quarter with $555 million of cash on the balance sheet. We continue to see increasing cost pressure with inflation -- with total inflation of 7% this quarter, which was higher than our previous expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, we began taking additional pricing in the third quarter and have also implemented additional actions to further preserve the strength of our business model while balancing the impact to our guests. For the third quarter, total pricing was 3.7% and for the fourth quarter, we expect our pricing to be approximately 6% compared to last year. As a result, we now expect pricing to be just over 3% for the full fiscal year. This is well below our updated total inflation expectations of 6% for the year as we continue to execute our strategy of pricing below overall inflation to strengthen our value leadership position. Turning to our P&L and segment performance for the third quarter. We are comparing against pre-COVID results in the third quarter of 2020, which we believe are more comparable to normal business operations and with how we've been framing our margin expansion opportunity. For the third quarter, food and beverage expenses were 270 basis points higher, driven by elevated commodities inflation as well as investments in food quality, portion size and pricing significantly below inflation. Our commodity inflation this quarter was 11%. Restaurant labor was 50 basis points higher, driven by wage inflation, higher sick pay and overtime expense as a result of Omicron. Hourly wage inflation during the quarter was just over 9%. Restaurant labor as a percent of sales in fiscal December and February was better than pre-COVID as these months did not experience the same scale of headwinds from Omicron. Restaurant expenses were 80 basis points lower, as our teams continue to manage controllable expenses. Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 190 basis points of favorability. As a result, restaurant-level EBITDA margin for Darden was 19.4%, 50 basis points below pre-COVID levels for the quarter. However, both in December and February, restaurant-level EBITDA margins grew by almost 100 basis points compared to pre-COVID. G&A expense was 90 basis points lower, driven by savings from the corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021, a decrease in mark-to-market expense, lower travel expenses, and sales leverage. Turning to our segment performance. Sales and segment profit margins significantly increased versus last year for all of our segments. As we compare to pre-COVID, all segments, other than Olive Garden, grew sales. Olive Garden sales were slightly lower due to disproportionate impact Olive Garden experienced from the significant increase in COVID cases. This is because Olive Garden's geographic footprint and guest demographics make it more sensitive to COVID case counts. Additionally, Olive Garden continues to have significantly less marketing and promotional activity, which is a headwind to sales growth when comparing to pre-COVID. The January impact from Omicron I discussed earlier resulted in all of our segments experiencing lower segment profit margin in the quarter relative to pre-COVID.  Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. We updated our outlook for the full year to reflect our performance year-to-date and our expected performance for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.62 billion, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 29% to 30% and approximately 35 new restaurants; capital spending of approximately $425 million; total inflation of approximately 6%, with commodities inflation of approximately 9% and total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation approaching 9%; EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion; an annual effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%; and approximately 129 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.30 and $7.45. This outlook implies full year EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID of roughly 200 basis points, still within our previous expected range. This outlook also implies fourth quarter sales between $2.52 billion and $2.59 billion and EPS between $2.13 and $2.28, which is higher than what was contemplated in the previous outlook we provided in December. As Gene said, our quarter-to-date average weekly sales are slightly ahead of February, and that is incorporated in this guidance. Looking forward to fiscal 2023, we're providing some preliminary guidance for a few items. We expect to open approximately 60 new units in fiscal 2023. We project total capital spending between $500 million and $550 million. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 14% for fiscal 2023. Now, I'll turn it back to Gene.\nGene Lee: Thanks, Raj. This morning marked my 31st and final earnings call in my years leading Darden. So all the analysts who support us, thank you for believing us, our vision and our ability to execute. And for those of you who didn't always believe in us, thank you as well. You motivated me more than you will ever know. I want to thank our shareholders for the trust they have shown us and by investing in Darden. I will miss our time together, whether it's a one-on-one meeting, a group meeting or one of the many dinners we shared over the year. And finally, thank you to all the team members in our restaurants and our support center for the lifeblood of our company. I look forward to seeing you in our restaurants in my new role as Chair. I began this journey 45 years ago as a high school kid busting table. I've learned a lot of lessons throughout my career, but two in particular have served as guiding principles for me. First, when it comes to making decisions, you have to make sure both your guests and team members win. When those two critical stakeholders win, it's a good decision. Second, this is a simple business. Malcolm Nance [ph] said it best. The restaurant business is simple, but simple is hard. To be successful in the restaurant industry, you must have great people who consistently serve outstanding food and an engaging atmosphere. So I may have bored you with my back-to-basics operating philosophy, running great restaurants will always require intense focus on the fundamentals. As I transition into my new role as Chair, I'm confident Darden is set up for success. Rick is ready to lead the company, and he and his team will do a great job. Now, we'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. My question is about the margin outlook given the inflation environment you're facing. And I think you had previously guided to 200 to 250 basis points of margin expansion relative to pre-COVID levels. And it looks like you're going to comment in on that range for the fiscal year. But as you think about the forward-looking outlook, beyond this year, do you think that is still in play as you think about the inflation as you move into fiscal 2023, or do you think that needs to change?\nRaj Vennam: Hi David. Good morning, this is Raj. So, let me just step back and talk about margins. When we began the year, obviously, things have changed quite a bit from the environment today relative to how we started the year is very different. We started the year with 3% inflation assumption and pricing closer to 1.5%. And here we are, three quarters in, we're looking at 6% total inflation, and our pricing has only gone up by about 1.5%. So, we started with 1.5% and now we're just over 3% for the full year and still are able to get to that 200 basis points. So, we really feel good about where we are getting to by the end of this year. We'll share more details in June call in terms of how we're thinking about fiscal 2023. But I think in the current environment, considering the situation we're in, we feel good about where we expect to be for this fiscal year.\nDavid Tarantino: Got it. And then just a follow-up on that. You are -- sounds like you're leaning in a bit more on pricing with the fourth quarter being up 6%. I guess how did you arrive at the decision to take that much pricing? And how do you feel about the consumers' ability to absorb that level of pricing?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, I think if you actually look back to what we've done over the last few quarters and actually last couple of years, we've taken very little pricing. We said all along that we wanted to preserve the flexibility. We wanted to -- we approach pricing very conservatively. And so we've been trying to hold off on pricing as much as the inflation would have dictated. And I think where we are now is 6%. While 6% seems high on -- in terms of how historically we price, considering the environment and considering what we're pricing over two years, we don't think it's too much. Obviously, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to price below inflation. And like I said earlier, this year, we're pricing 300 below. And as inflation creeps up, we're going to have to try to manage through that, but it's going to be a combination of pricing and productivity initiatives.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. Thank you. And Gene, congrats again on a great run as CEO.\nGene Lee: Thank you, David.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations, Gene. We seem to be sitting here at a point in time when operators and investors are increasingly concerned about lapping stimulus and doing so at a time when gas prices are surging, and this does not seem to be impacting your outlook based on your comments around March and based on the implied 4Q revenue guidance, which implies very strong trends. So, can you just comment on the environment out there? And maybe why Darden seems to not be prone to it.\nGene Lee: Brian, I think -- this is Gene. I think one comment, and I'll let Rick jump in here, too. But one of the things that gives us confidence around pricing -- increasing the pricing level to 6% is that our wage rate at the lower end are increasing higher than that. So we're seeing almost double digit when you look at our direct labor. So we believe that wage inflation throughout the country is rising at a pretty rapid rate. And so we believe that the consumer can handle that right now based on where things are today, right? The environment can shift pretty quickly on us here. But what we're seeing today is that consumer demand remains fairly strong. And as this environment seems to be very different than a lot of other environments we've operated in the past, where we\u2019ve got a lot of headwinds impacting the consumer, but wages are increasing rapidly and especially more so on the lower end.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Brian. And I'll add to the current environment. As you think about what's going on in Ukraine, first of all, I want to say our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine, but the fact is we don't know how long the conflict is going to last. And so we don't know how long that's going to do anything to the environment itself. We're focused on controlling what we can control, confident in our ability to manage our business effectively in any operating environment. The other thing to think about is restaurant supply is down 13-ish%, 14% from pre-COVID. And so that gives people that want to go out, and people do want to go out, fewer options, and we are a great option for them. So -- and then last thing I'll say is you'll notice that our guidance range is a little bit wider than it normally would be in a quarter at the end. And that's just because of the uncertainty that we're feeling, but we feel good about the guidance we gave. We just gave a little bit bigger range just because of what we're going through today.\nBrian Bittner: Great. Thank you Gene and Rick.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brett Levy, MKM Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBrett Levy: Great. Thanks for taking the question, and Gene, your comments will be surely missed over the next few years as we come out of these more challenging times. When you think about your operating model and all of the -- with inflation, labor shortages, all of the rising pressures on the consumer, how should we think about what you can implement in terms of technology? How conservative you want to be in terms of newness to the menu over the next, we'll say, two to six quarters? How should we think about what you can really monitor on the controllables to drive productivity versus your need to stay front-footed? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Brett, it's Rick. And a couple of things on that question. So on the technology front we continue to have the same goal. It's implementing technology that reduces friction across the value chain, wherever that friction is, and responding to guest growing need for personalization. We don't anticipate using technology to take people out of the system because this is a full-service restaurant and full service company, and we believe that consumers want a human interaction. In terms of menu, we've been clear that we really like the reduction in menu and what it's done to provide our guests with the dishes they want at high-value dishes that they want and make it easier for our teams to produce them. And we can continue to get better. If we add new items, we take another item off. And so we're going to be consistent on making sure our menus stay at the levels they are today within a very small percentage up or down. On the controllables front, we still have some costs that will be coming in over time. But as we look to the future and project as we think about sales going forward, we would expect to get some productivity, but we don't think margin is going to be moving very much from where it is today. We'll talk about -- more about that in June as we think about our fiscal 2023. But just if you think about our long-term framework that we've had, it was 10 to 30 basis points of margin improvement. We got seven years of margin improvement in two years. And so we have to make sure that we manage that and consider that margin improvement we've made over the last couple of years.\nBrett Levy: And then just one quick follow-up. When you think about the mix of your consumers right now shifting either to a higher-value product for the pursuit of value, have you seen any material movement in the mix, I guess, by Olive Garden, by LongHorn and then just across the consolidated?\nRick Cardenas: No, Brett, we haven't seen any movement.\nBrett Levy: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Glass: Hi, thanks. Good morning, Gene. I don't think you bored any of us. I think, actually, you taught us all a lot about the industry. So thank you for that. On -- Raj, on commodities specifically, I know you've provided some insight on the deck here about through May. Do you have the sort of the contract beyond that, or do you think it's too early given the volatility? Do you have any visibility, I guess, into 2023 on at least that expense item?\nRaj Vennam: John, we are obviously starting to have conversations. We have -- we are -- I would say, from a -- compared to historical situation, we're probably less contracted and we're working through those over the next few months, and we'll have more to share in June. But the forward premiums are too high to contract that far.\nJohn Glass: Thank you for that. And then just related to your comments about pricing and the consumer can tolerate that pricing, how are you thinking about your promotional tactics in '23? Do you start to come up with alternative plans if the consumer is weaker than you expect? Are you starting to revisit your thoughts about the marketing spend in the business? How are you preparing if, in fact, consumer demand starts to weaken? And what are some of the tactics just broadly that you think you could employ to continue the sales momentum?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, John, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. I will say we're not going to talk too much about 2023. But I will say, we've got contingency plans for anything. If the economy slows down, we've got some plans. We won't talk about what they are. If the economy stays strong, then we'll continue what we're doing. And so until we see what that is and where it is, we don't really want to comment on what we would do.\nJohn Glass: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brian Mullan at Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBrian Mullan: Hey, thank you. Thanks for the development color on fiscal 2023. Just wondering if you could speak to how that pipeline is building beyond that on a multiyear basis. And it would be great to hear your thoughts on what you're seeing from a competition for site perspective. Are you seeing other large chain casual diners out there looking at these same sites? Just anything different or notable that force going out versus how the environment was prior to COVID when there were more restaurants.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Brian, we're continuing to build our pipeline for fiscal 2024 and beyond. And as we've said before, we'd like to get closer to the higher end of our long-term framework in the future. As we're seeing competition for sites, we aren't seeing as many people competing for sites, but there are still brands that are out there growing and competing for site. And so as we continue to build the pipeline, we will continue to compete for some of those sites. I will say, add to that, we are taking over some sites and building some restaurant and converting some to our brands at an economical rate. And they're really great sites. Those brands just didn't stay through. So we'll continue to build our pipeline. We still have some cost inflation in there, but our business model has improved so much that is offsetting that by more than enough. And we feel good that we'll continue to build our pipeline.\nBrian Mullan: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Peter Saleh of BTIG. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the question and congrats again, Gene. Gene, I think several quarters ago, you had mentioned that you were seeing about 10% fewer units in casual dining versus pre-pandemic, but there was, I think, a lot of speculation still in the category and people opening up restaurants. Are you still seeing that? Is it still fairly competitive out there in terms of development, or has the environment -- the inflationary environment kind of pushed that down a little bit and made that subside a little bit?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think if you go back -- and what I was trying to say back then was that there was a lot of speculation, especially by some of the big REITs out there that were willing to take on some real estate and leave it vacant for a while and the carry costs were less. We haven't seen any real change in that. My expectation would be, as interest rates rise, there'll be less speculation in the real estate market and people will be less likely to allow their buildings to sit dark for a period of time. And so, as Rick said before, in the prior question, we're building our pipeline. There's competition out -- there, not a lot of chain restaurants out there competing. There's a lot of smaller regional players out there competing for space. At the end of the day, most landlords want a Darden guarantee signature on their property. We get to look at most of the real estate out there in the United States, and we get first look at it. And if we can make it work, we're going to -- we'll sign a lease and we'll try to put the right brand on there to maximize the opportunity.\nPeter Saleh: Thank you for that. And then, just on the development for 2023, can you give us a sense on how much of that development is coming from Cheddar's?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. It's going to be somewhere in the low single digits, maybe as much as 10, but lower single digits to as much as 10.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jeffrey Bernstein at Barclays. Your line is open. Please, go ahead.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you. Gene, thank you for your steady leadership and friendship over the years and for setting an example for the industry to follow. So a question on the off-premise business. It seems like it's stickier than we would have thought, I think you said 30% at Olive Garden, 16% at LongHorn. Just wondering if you can maybe share the split between delivery and pickup within that current trucks sales and maybe where you think that's going to settle? I mean it just seems like a lot of this is here to stay. I'm just wondering whether there's any chance you guys would reconsider opening up to maybe third-party delivery aggregators. It seems like the consumer expects it and the consistencies improve, the fees are eased. I don't want to see you guys lose out if this is kind of where the future is going. So, any thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.\nGene Lee: Hey, Jeff, this is Gene. I thought you'd wait until I leave the room to ask about third-party delivery. I'll let Rick take that.\nRick Cardenas: Hey Jeff, thanks for the question. Gene and I are in the same place on what we believe with third-party delivery. We still don't like that model. We don't think it's the right thing for having someone get in between us and our guests, and a couple of points. Olive Garden has grown their To Go business significantly. And in many ways, faster than others have grown it with third-party delivery without that margin hit. Now, our takeout sales increased in Q3 from Q2, partly because of the influx of Omicron. And so people shifted again back to a To Go experience. We're seeing a little bit of a shift back to on-premise in Q4. We don't know where equilibrium is going to be. And when we get there, it will probably be higher than where we were before COVID, but it's not going to be at the levels they are today. And so we'll continue to make investments that we need to take the friction out of the order, pick up and pay experience so that people don't consider getting delivered. Now, you did ask about our delivery. We do have large party delivery for Olive Garden and that's a good business for us. It's a minimum order size. It gives us enough time to prep the order and deliver it to our guests and actually do a little bit more of a setup for it. I mean, so we really feel good about that business, but we never say never, but the likelihood of us getting into third-party delivery anytime soon is pretty low.\nJeff Bernstein: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Dennis Geiger of UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you and Gene, congrats on a remarkable run. Wanted to ask on the staffing situation a bit more. Sort of where are you now on staffing levels relative to where you'd like to be? And kind of related to that, as it relates to wage inflation, recognizing there's a lot your mind, or is it too soon to make that call?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Dennis, this is Rick. Thanks for the question on the staffing side. We feel -- as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel much better about where we are in our staffing today than we did three months ago and three months before that. We continue to add around 10,000 people working per quarter, basically at the end of the quarter from the quarter before. Our staffing levels are greater than 95% of pre-COVID staffing levels. We don't need as many people as we did before because of our productivity enhancement. That said, we want to make sure that our team members that we have are fully trained and productive. And as we said, exclusions were pretty tough in the month of January, especially. In terms of wage inflation, we are, as we said, seeing a continued increase on applicant flow. And so while it hasn't reversed kind of the starting wage trends, it's actually starting to stabilize, but we don't know where that's going to land. But right now, it's starting to stabilize a little bit. And we'll know more as that applicant flow continues to pick up and people feel more comfortable working again after -- as Omicron hopefully become more of an endemic versus a pandemic.\nDennis Geiger: Great. And just one more there, Rick. As it relates to the competitive environment and the industry, you spoke to it some, I think, as it related to real estate opportunities. As it relates to market share, perhaps how are you thinking now about the small chain independent situation? Has it gotten better or worse as you look ahead? Has the opportunity for you to pick up share, because of closures, permanent closures, maybe more challenges that are coming, given all the inflation? Has that -- have your thoughts there changed at all on what that means for Darden's brands? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Dennis, our thoughts haven't changed as the economic environment continued to struggle over time, as Omicron picked up, more restaurant close. I mean, so there are fewer restaurants today than there were last month and the month before and the month before that. They'll eventually get filled. And our -- what we want to do is be there to fill some of those restaurants and pick up that market share. As we think about the future, we've said that we're going to increase -- hopefully get to the high end of our framework and new units. But those restaurants will eventually come back and be better than they were before. Our restaurants will be better than maybe the ones that were closed.\nDennis Geiger: Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Chris O'Cull at Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChris O'Cull: Thanks. My question relates to just consumers' value perception of Olive Garden. Rick, I'm curious if you've seen any change in the value perception as more orders have shifted to off-premise over the past couple of years, or if your strategy of pricing below inflation, as others have taken more aggressive pricing has had any impact on Olive Garden's value perception?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Chris, we haven't really seen a big impact in our internal data on a change in value perception at Olive Garden. We track both on-premise and off-premise. Olive Garden continues to increase their overall satisfaction from five years ago. There's a slope up versus most customers are actually more dissatisfied across the American consumer satisfaction index. We're bucking that trend. All of our brands are bucking that trend. And so we haven't seen a big change in value ratings for Olive Garden, and we'll continue to monitor that. We don't think the pricing actions that we have taken are going to change that dramatically because we're still, as Raj had mentioned, much lower than most full-service restaurants combined over a two-year period.\nChris O'Cull: That's helpful. And then just with marketing dollars down about 50% [ph] from pre-COVID levels, and other chains are starting to spend more on advertising, is there any concern at all that Olive Garden may lose top my mind awareness if marketing spend isn\u2019t increase more aggressively?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Chris, as you mentioned, we are lower in marketing spend than we were pre-COVID. We're going to continue to wait for the equilibrium. I'm really proud of the work that Dan and his team has done, keeping with our strategy. And so we have been marketing. But we're marketing our Never Any First Course to remind everybody about the value they get every day at Olive Garden. We're not doing promotional marketing, but we're talking about the value they get every day. And we'll continue to look at our marketing spend over time. And if the time we bring that back up, we would expect to earn a return on that, as we said on the last call. We feel Olive Garden is large, and one of their advantages is their scale, means that we will be marketing at Olive Garden. We just want to find the right time to continue to increase that, but it probably won't get all the way back to pre-COVID levels, but we'll see where equilibrium comes.\nChris O'Cull: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: We'll go next to Eric Gonzalez at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks for the question. And Gene, congrats on a fantastic career. It's really been a pleasure to follow your success over the years. My question is about the consumer environment. You talked about the rise in low-end wages being offset to some of the cost pressures out there. I'm also wondering if we might be experiencing some post-Omicron pent-up demand in March. Will the consumer might be less sensitive to price increases? So perhaps you could talk about how sustainable you believe the current momentum might be and maybe what factors might contribute to that sustainability?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Eric, this is Rick. I'll talk about the sustainability. We've guided where -- what we think our Q4 will be, and that includes everything we know today. And it talks about what our comp sales will be and what our total sales will be, which was higher than what we would have guided in December for Q4. There might be some pent-up demand for Omicron, but there's enough demand for COVID. And it might have been Omicron, but it's other things. And so we're going to continue to see what the equilibrium is. We keep coming back to that word equilibrium. What do we look like when everything is back to a more normal state, and it's a steady state. And we're not there yet. We've got geopolitical risk and other things, which is, again, why we have a wider range in our outlook for Q4 than we normally would at this time.\nEric Gonzalez: Fair enough. And maybe on labor costs quickly. You mentioned the heavy exclusions costs due to Omicron. I'm just wondering if you can comment on turnover levels and then maybe quantify how much of a drag, if you're seeing any excess staff training relative to normalized levels.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, turnover levels in the last -- you think about turnover the way we manage it. It's over a 12-month period, and you've got a lot of kind of fluctuation over time. But turnover levels are getting a little bit better for us in the long versus where we were just a few months back and months before that. We still have 90-day turnover at a higher level than we'd like it to be. So that's why we're focusing more on training even more and specifically on our new team members to make sure they get up to speed and they understand what our business is all about. And I'll let Raj talk about the other part.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. On the expense side, I'd say just purely the expense part of it probably impacted our margins by about 20 to 30 basis points related to all the Omicron impact, whether it's overtime, sick pay or training, all that stuff is probably in that 20 to 30 basis points range. I remind you, that doesn't include the deleverage from sales mix. So that's the other part of it that impacts the margins, too.\nEric Gonzalez: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nicole Miller at Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead. I apologize. We lost your line. We'll go to Andy Barish with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndy Barish: Yes, one \u2013 one quick follow-up. Just, Raj, on the $100 million sales impact you quoted, I was a little confused. Was that the Omicron impact and the winter weather impact? I just wanted to make sure I heard that okay.\nRaj Vennam: Yes, it was the impact of both in January. We were specifically referring to the impact in January, yes, from both.\nAndy Barish: Okay. and then, Gene, if you could kind of publicly impart a little bit of final wisdom on -- I mean, what would you be looking for? What would typically show up in consumer behavior if the consumer was starting to feel stressed from environmental factors?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think -- I mean, obviously, we've been trying to regress a bunch of different variables back in the past recessions to try to give us a chance to understand what the leading indicator may be. I think this one is so different because of the geopolitical risk involved, because of a pandemic that, hopefully, we're going to switch to endemic and we're able to live with this virus going forward. I think that it's going to take a fairly solid recession to really have some impact on the consumer. I think the consumer balance sheet is stronger than it has been previously. And I think the biggest variable going forward that as I think about it, it's different than every other recession or a period that we had a real slowdown is that, there's so many open jobs today. And when you think about what really causes a recession, it's employment. And as things slow down a little bit, it's just -- it's not -- I just don't see companies, especially where the supply chains have been somewhat broken and inventories levels are low, I don't see us getting to a higher -- a significantly higher unemployment level anytime in the near term, barring something really happens bad with what's going on overseas. And so I just think this one is different, because of where employment is. It's not like we've perfectly matched everybody that's willing to work with a number of open jobs. We have so many open jobs today. And I look at our shop here and say, 'Boy, if we had to come in and cut some more overhead, it would be almost impossible to do, because we have a fair number of open jobs here.' So that's the one variable that I think is so different in this environment. I don't know how it's going to play out. But remember, we're in a business where, like in an Olive Garden, if three or four tables don't come in tonight and 12 to 16 guests, it's going to have a pretty big impact on the business over time. So we're fighting -- I always say, we're fighting for that last four top. That last four top is so profitable, and we need to make sure that we continue to create great value and we got to operate well. And I think that's the big thing out there today is that the operator -- I think casual dining restaurants and full-service restaurants in general is, we just need to operate better. I think we got sloppy during COVID. We've had to do things to just stay open and get by. We got to get sharp again. And I think our teams are doing a great job. But I think as an industry, we've got to earn the right from the consumer to pay what we're asking them to pay. And we've got to provide a really true full-service environment.\nAndy Barish: Thanks again.\nOperator: And we'll return to Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. And Nicole, your line is open. Please, go ahead.\nNicole Miller: Thank you so much. I hit the hang-up button versus on mute, so I apologize. Two quick ones. On Olive Garden, in, let's say, a normalized environment, you had mentioned the sales and marketing. Can you talk about and reconcile a little bit marketing in the framework of discounting? Because it seems like a lot of investment has gone back into the store and into the plate really consumer-facing areas. And so it also seems like it would be tempting with sales just down a smidge to go back to discounting, but maybe that isn't the right strategy. Could you just talk about that a little bit?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Nicole. We are really pleased with the strategy that we have. We believe that it's better to provide an experience with a great guest experience that are people -- or people, our core guests that are willing to pay for that experience. And we would rather not discount. We took out all discounting out of Olive Garden in all of our brands at COVID. I mean we haven't added that back. Others have started to add that back, but we are continuing to maintain our strategy of keeping the discounts out of our brand. Again, as the environment changes, if the environment changes, we will consider anything, but we have a lot of options. Our biggest option is to increase our marketing spend, whether it's -- even undiscounted just to get our strategy, our message out at Olive Garden of a never-ending first course. That is a great value. And as we think about limited time offers in the future, if we have them, they'll be at a different construct than we had before. But again, when equilibrium comes and we know which way we go, that's when we'll act.\nNicole Miller: And then if that equilibrium does not come, I'm curious about Cheddar's, not that anyone would or could move this quickly. But if it's a weaker macro period, do you press on value and marketing the value of Cheddar's and/or even grow the units as fast as possible? It seems like that's one of the best or better value propositions in the portfolio.\nRick Cardenas: Hey Nicole, Cheddar's is a great value. That is their advantage as well, value. And we're continuing to improve the experience at Cheddar's, improve the food, improve the service experience while keeping prices much lower and pricing much lower than our competition, which is just going to improve the value perception even more. Cheddar's doesn't have as much scale to do kind of the TV kind of advertising. Our best advertising at Cheddar's is when you get your check and you see the price that you're paying and you tell your friends. We're going to continue to do that and find other ways with digital and other things if we need to, to ramp up marketing in our brands. And in terms of new unit growth, those pipelines take a while to build, right? So, we're building them now. You can't kind of turn on a dime if the consumer gets a little weaker and say we're just going to open that quite a few more of one brand versus the other. But we believe in Cheddar's, and we believe that they have a lot of growth ahead of them. And we're going to continue to build a pipeline of people and of restaurant to capture that opportunity.\nNicole Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Andrew Charles at Cowen. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Gene, best wishes on a well-deserved retirement and Rick, best of luck to you in your new role. The mix of digital sales as a percent of off-premise grew this quarter to 63% from 60% of sales previously. And Rick, I know you said the equilibrium -- where the off-premise mix can go is unclear relative to that prior 20%-plus target. But is there another boundary for how high that digital mix of off-premise can go? And then I have a follow-up.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, I don't think there's a limiter of how high the digital mix will go other than 100%. But there are still people that want to call in and dial in and pick up their order. They may not be as comfortable with the technology. We're trying to make it as seamless and smooth as possible. But we're even making that experience better for the people that dial in, how do they pay and how do they pick up. So, we're doing things on the technology front that maybe they don't see as much, but that we can get better so that they can still do the dial-ins for us. We would like to see the digital percentage continue to grow as part of off-premise. It just simplifies the operation in the restaurant. There's fewer things that the team members have to do to pick up the phone, et cetera. But there are some long-standing guests that just like to call, and we'll continue to offer that service to them. We will not eliminate dial-in to get the percentages up. These percentages have grown because of the investments that we've made and will continue to make. And hopefully, they'll continue to grow.\nAndrew Charles: Great. And then just relatedly, can we expect to see a higher mix of digital marketing in 2023 versus 2022 to drive a higher digital off-premise mix and help increase data collection, or will the focus of the 2023 marketing message pivot back to driving more dine-in sales?\nRick Cardenas: Andrew, we're not going to talk as much about what's going on in 2023. I will say that whatever the environment looks like, whether we need to drive more dine-in sales versus off-premise, we'll do. We don't really do a lot of digital marketing on the off-premise, so most of our marketing is for on-premise. And so if we do any off-premise marketing, it will be an increase. So pretty much most of our marketing is -- I'm sorry, if we do any off-premise marketing, it will be the increase. Most of our marketing is on-premise.\nAndrew Charles: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lauren Silberman at Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. And Gene, I also echo everyone's comments about your leadership. So on the accelerating commodity pressures, beyond additional price, can you talk about any other levers you're looking at in the supply chain to help offset some of the commodity pressures, any flexibility in some of ingredients and sourcing?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Lauren, we really like the way our menu works right now and the taste in our food. So we don't have a -- we don't expect to go in there and change ingredients significantly to offset some of these costs. We'll continue to work with our supply chain partners to get the best prices that we can get for the product. I will say, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're going to do whatever it takes to get the products that our consumers value and that our consumers expect to have when they come in to eat with us. We're hoping that eventually this inflation environment gets a little bit better, but we think we can compete in whatever environment there is.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Chris Carril at RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChris Carril: Thanks and good morning. Gene, congratulations and wish you all the best going forward. So just on the additional pricing you'll take beginning this quarter, can you provide any further detail on how you're planning to implement this additional pricing across the portfolio, maybe specifically at your largest brands versus your higher end brands?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. I think, Chris, the way we've talked about before is our philosophy is generally to price less at casual dining. And obviously, that can vary from quarter-to-quarter. So I don't want to get into the exact specifics because these numbers change monthly, quarterly because it's a function of what we're wrapping on and how this goes. But generally speaking, there's a lot of science that goes into how we go about pricing and there are -- and that is very analytical, but there's also a lot of art that we've gained over time, the intuition that we've developed looking at data over time being in this business for a long time.\nChris Carril: Got it. And then, I guess, as a follow-up, Raj. You mentioned productivity initiatives to also help offset these incremental cost pressures that you're seeing. So can you expand maybe on what some of these productivity initiatives look like? Is this just more related to new employee training?\nRaj Vennam: I think it goes back -- some of that is that, but I think it goes back to the things that we did through COVID. A lot of the stuff is a continuation of what we've done with simplification. We continue to find opportunities to simplify. And then as Rick said in his comments, as we're hiring new people, our focus is on training them to be more productive. So there is a lot of new people in our system right now, and we want them to be at their best, and that takes time.\nChris Carril: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. The question was also just on the staffing, and I guess who the applicants are in 2022 relative to 2019. It was curious or good to hear that your overall turnover levels, I guess, on an annual basis are beginning to improve. But how would you -- I guess, I think you described your overall productivity and the hospitality elements of your employees. I mean, is this still basically the type of employment class that you expect to get back to fiscal 2019 hospitality levels, or have there been some changes, including your menu simplification, that might actually allow the calendar-2022-and-beyond class to actually execute better than what you've done in the past based on some of the process changes that you've made?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, John, to answer the question directly, I think we can get better, continue to get better with this class because of the menu simplification we've made. When reducing our menus the way we did has made it a lot easier to run a restaurant. The managers spend a little less time on individual items and teaching people on these items that we didn't produce very often. I mean we just get better at producing the same things over and over again, which are the things that our guests want. We've had a couple of things that have happened through COVID that have been good for us. One is we've hired some folks that maybe we wouldn't have looked at before, maybe it's her first job. But giving someone their first job and teaching them to do the things the way we do it is a good thing for us. Maybe in the past, we would have said, 'You needed to have a lot of experience in a restaurant before you come to work for ours.' But we're seeing that some of these folks that we're hiring that are new to work, we're teaching them how to work the way we want them to work and it's actually working out for us pretty well. We also have seen a lot of rehires. A lot of people are coming back to work for us that have left us over time. And a lot of our managers are rehires. And so while people may have left the industry during COVID, a lot of them are coming back, and we feel really good about the fact that they're coming back to work for us.\nJohn Ivankoe: That\u2019s helpful. Congratulations again, Gene.\nOperator: We'll go next to David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Congrats, Gene, on a heck of a career. All the best to you in retirement. I have a question about Cheddar's and Darden\u2019s acquisition strategy going forward. Cheddar's has gone through a lot of change before COVID. I think some of that was more painful and slow than you would have expected, but it seemed to have reached pretty transformational levels with labor productivity during COVID. So could you talk about Cheddar's new unit returns today? And what that unit growth could possibly look like going forward for that brand? How fast can it ramp? And I have a quick follow-up on this.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, David, let me just say how proud I am of John Wilkerson and his team and what they've done over COVID over two years of significantly changing the business model at Cheddar's to make it a much more investable proposition for us. As we said in one of the earlier questions, kind of the new unit opening range of low single digits to high -- to up to 10, we'll probably open more than we've had since we bought them. And we'll continue to build that pipeline as we continue to strengthen the team. The great thing that they have done is build the team to be ready to open restaurants. And that wasn't ready when we got them. And so, I can't tell you how big Cheddar's will be, but I can tell you that they have a big addressable population. The values that they provide, the value that they provide for the consumer and the food that they have, means there's a lot of Cheddar's that can be built out there. How many? I can't tell you until we get some more of these open. I will say, the restaurants that we've opened through COVID had done really well for us, and we feel really good about the fact that we can open more Cheddar's.\nDave Palmer: And, I mean, I don't know, maybe you want to circle back on the unit returns part of that? But I also have a follow-up just on sort of what that means, as you're getting past Cheddar's, are acquisitions going to be even more in focus for you? And I just think it's worth just noting how unusual it would be if Darden were to become, sort of, get an acquisition premium, if you will. Because right now, there's not many play -- not many companies out there. You can see an acquisition strategy paying off in an accretive way, where the multiple reflects that, like that rinse-and-repeat credibility on acquisitions. So maybe you want to comment on that capability? And how much of this is going to be a focus for you going forward. And thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, David. If you think about our acquisition strategy, we've made four big acquisitions since 2007. And that should still be part of our strategy going forward. We've proven that we can get synergies. And we've proven over time, it takes a while that we get these brands up and running and ready to go and grow. But our management team and Board regularly evaluate that, and nothing is going to change as we go forward. We believe Darden is a platform, a platform that can add brands that help Darden grow and continue to build our biggest advantage, which is scale.\nDave Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please, go ahead.\nJared Garber: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And, certainly, appreciate all the great color on the quarter, and I think on the consumer as we think, I think, ahead for the rest of the year. Many of the questions have certainly been asked and answered, but I wanted to get a sense of maybe some other strategies that you're thinking about in terms of making the consumer value proposition stronger outside of the price dynamic. So wondering if you can comment on how loyalty plays into your thinking here, whether that's a brand-specific program or something across the platform. Or are there any other, sort of, strategies that you're thinking through that might improve that value proposition outside of just stronger menu and sort of better value pricing?\nRick Cardenas: Hi, Jared. As we think about our strategy and value proposition, it's really what we've been talking about for years in our basic, simple operating philosophy: food, service and atmosphere. We're going to continue to invest in food, make it better and make it more consistent every time you come into one of our restaurants. We're going to continue to improve our service, and we're going to make sure our atmospheres are great. In terms of -- while we, again, price, continue to price, is our expectation below our competition and below inflation, we believe that, that is the best way to build value. Loyalty, we've looked at that before. We may look at it again. I'm not quite sure that, that's where the value comes from is to give a discount to your highest core consumers. Our goal is to build an additional visit to our core consumers, and we've been doing that without discounting because we're giving them what they want at a price that they think is a fair value for them and a great value for them. And we'll continue to do that going forward.\nJared Garber: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for sneaking me in here and Gene, congratulations, just to echo all the thoughts there. My question was on the idea that the pent-up demand post-COVID itself and not just Omicron, and given all the -- how data-intensive you are, I'm wondering if you can share any data on how many -- whether you're seeing consumers come back in that haven't come in, in a couple of years, maybe how material that is, whether you're really seeing a shift in consumers kind of more post-COVID. And then a separate question is just on regionality. I think as investors are concerned about what gas prices might be doing to consumer, it's higher prices in different regions and specifically in the West Coast, whether you're seeing any kind of more pronounced near-term impact as you think about maybe your quarter-to-date trends, whether there's much variability there.\nRick Cardenas: Jake, in terms of kind of the pent-up demand over -- for COVID versus Omicron, yes, we're seeing some consumers that haven't been with us for a couple of years in our dining rooms and are dining, right? So, there were -- there are still a percentage of people that didn't feel comfortable going out even as Delta kind of waned and people thought maybe COVID was kind of done at that time. And so we're still seeing guests that are coming back and there'll probably be some more that come back. We're still a little skewed. If we think about our skew of demographics, we're still a little bit lower in our mix of those over 65 because, I think, they felt a little bit less comfortable, but that mix is getting better. And in terms -- I forgot the second part.\nJake Bartlett: Geography.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, in terms of geography, the geography piece, I'm sorry, Yes, I don't think we're going to get into the geography in just three weeks, right, quarter-to-date. I will say that the geographic impact in Q3 were much more related to Omicron than they were for anything else, depending on what that geographic region felt about COVID versus not, but not getting into kind of the gas prices in just a really short period of time because they're already -- the gas prices kind of moved up and moved down a little bit over those three weeks.\nJake Bartlett: Got it. And just a quick follow-up. I think there's more concern about the lower-income consumer. And Gene, you mentioned just that's where the low-income consumer is seeing the most wage inflation. So, I appreciate that offset. But are you seeing any differences in maybe in quarter-to-date or February in terms of the types of consumers that you're exposed to? Any insight there as to whether there's -- one is a little more wobbly than the other or whether they're kind of all performing about the same?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Jake, we're not really seeing a big material difference in consumers through February, March based on anything that's going on in the geopolitical environment or what's going on with inflation.\nJake Bartlett: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Sure.\nOperator: We'll take our final question from Nick Setyan with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nNick Setyan: Thank you, and thank you Gene, for all of your wisdom throughout the years. My question is specifically on just lead costs, given the importance of pasta and bread. It would be just very helpful if you could frame your exposure in some way, whether it's a percentage of the food basket or this is the pricing we would need to take to offset it. Is there any way you can frame your exposure if we should be worried about it?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. Nick, maybe I'll just dimensionalize it for you. When you look at our food basket, wheat makes up about 7%; call it, 2% to 3% is pasta related; and then the rest is bakery and bread. So that's really where the exposure to wheat directly is. We're continuing to see what happens in that market, and we'll work with our vendors to just make sure we get the best price we can in the environment we're in.\nNick Setyan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And with no other questions holding, Mr. Kalicak, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing comments.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Jess. That concludes our call. And I'd like to remind you that we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 23rd, before the market opens, with a conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today's call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter was one of stark contrast, and I'm pleased with our performance in this highly volatile environment. Our team did a great job controlling what they could control. In fiscal December, we achieved record sales while meeting our internal profit expectations that were contemplated in the guidance we provided in December. However, in fiscal January, which is a high-volume period for us, the Omicron variant significantly impacted consumer demand, restaurant staffing and operating expenses. We also experienced substantial weather impacts, all of which resulted in significantly lower sales and earnings than our internal expectations. Finally, as COVID cases declined and the operating environment normalized, sales improved throughout fiscal February, and we had strong results that exceeded our internal expectations. Sales strength has continued into March. Quarter-to-date, our average weekly sales are slightly ahead of our February actuals, and these trends are incorporated in our guidance. When we talked last in December, we could not have predicted the impacts Omicron would have on our business. In fact, the dramatic spike in cases create the most difficult operating environment since the initial onset of COVID two years ago. Rick will provide more details on the impact it had on our staffing levels in a moment. Omicron also created additional pressure on expenses at the restaurant level as we saw higher levels of sick pay and we incurred significant overtime costs due to staffing shortages caused by exclusions. The January spike also caused further supply chain disruptions, and we now expect inflation to be higher in Q4 than when we talked in December. We have implemented pricing actions to mitigate the impacts of rising costs, and Raj will provide more detail in his remarks. We recognize that all of us in the industry faced additional risk due to the current geopolitical environment such as higher inflation and further supply chain disruptions. However, I'm confident that Darden can compete effectively in any operating environment. We have a strong balance sheet and the right strategy in place, driven by our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented culture. And our brands are relentlessly focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service, and atmosphere. Now, I'll turn it over to Rick. Thanks, Raj. This morning marked my 31st and final earnings call in my years leading Darden. So all the analysts who support us, thank you for believing us, our vision and our ability to execute. And for those of you who didn't always believe in us, thank you as well. You motivated me more than you will ever know. I want to thank our shareholders for the trust they have shown us and by investing in Darden. I will miss our time together, whether it's a one-on-one meeting, a group meeting or one of the many dinners we shared over the year. And finally, thank you to all the team members in our restaurants and our support center for the lifeblood of our company. I look forward to seeing you in our restaurants in my new role as Chair. I began this journey 45 years ago as a high school kid busting table. I've learned a lot of lessons throughout my career, but two in particular have served as guiding principles for me. First, when it comes to making decisions, you have to make sure both your guests and team members win. When those two critical stakeholders win, it's a good decision. Second, this is a simple business. Malcolm Nance [ph] said it best. The restaurant business is simple, but simple is hard. To be successful in the restaurant industry, you must have great people who consistently serve outstanding food and an engaging atmosphere. So I may have bored you with my back-to-basics operating philosophy, running great restaurants will always require intense focus on the fundamentals. As I transition into my new role as Chair, I'm confident Darden is set up for success. Rick is ready to lead the company, and he and his team will do a great job. Now, we'll open it up for questions. Thank you, David. Brian, I think -- this is Gene. I think one comment, and I'll let Rick jump in here, too. But one of the things that gives us confidence around pricing -- increasing the pricing level to 6% is that our wage rate at the lower end are increasing higher than that. So we're seeing almost double digit when you look at our direct labor. So we believe that wage inflation throughout the country is rising at a pretty rapid rate. And so we believe that the consumer can handle that right now based on where things are today, right? The environment can shift pretty quickly on us here. But what we're seeing today is that consumer demand remains fairly strong. And as this environment seems to be very different than a lot of other environments we've operated in the past, where we've got a lot of headwinds impacting the consumer, but wages are increasing rapidly and especially more so on the lower end. Yes. I think if you go back -- and what I was trying to say back then was that there was a lot of speculation, especially by some of the big REITs out there that were willing to take on some real estate and leave it vacant for a while and the carry costs were less. We haven't seen any real change in that. My expectation would be, as interest rates rise, there'll be less speculation in the real estate market and people will be less likely to allow their buildings to sit dark for a period of time. And so, as Rick said before, in the prior question, we're building our pipeline. There's competition out -- there, not a lot of chain restaurants out there competing. There's a lot of smaller regional players out there competing for space. At the end of the day, most landlords want a Darden guarantee signature on their property. We get to look at most of the real estate out there in the United States, and we get first look at it. And if we can make it work, we're going to -- we'll sign a lease and we'll try to put the right brand on there to maximize the opportunity. Hey, Jeff, this is Gene. I thought you'd wait until I leave the room to ask about third-party delivery. I'll let Rick take that. Yes. I think -- I mean, obviously, we've been trying to regress a bunch of different variables back in the past recessions to try to give us a chance to understand what the leading indicator may be. I think this one is so different because of the geopolitical risk involved, because of a pandemic that, hopefully, we're going to switch to endemic and we're able to live with this virus going forward. I think that it's going to take a fairly solid recession to really have some impact on the consumer. I think the consumer balance sheet is stronger than it has been previously. And I think the biggest variable going forward that as I think about it, it's different than every other recession or a period that we had a real slowdown is that, there's so many open jobs today. And when you think about what really causes a recession, it's employment. And as things slow down a little bit, it's just -- it's not -- I just don't see companies, especially where the supply chains have been somewhat broken and inventories levels are low, I don't see us getting to a higher -- a significantly higher unemployment level anytime in the near term, barring something really happens bad with what's going on overseas. And so I just think this one is different, because of where employment is. It's not like we've perfectly matched everybody that's willing to work with a number of open jobs. We have so many open jobs today. And I look at our shop here and say, 'Boy, if we had to come in and cut some more overhead, it would be almost impossible to do, because we have a fair number of open jobs here.' So that's the one variable that I think is so different in this environment. I don't know how it's going to play out. But remember, we're in a business where, like in an Olive Garden, if three or four tables don't come in tonight and 12 to 16 guests, it's going to have a pretty big impact on the business over time. So we're fighting -- I always say, we're fighting for that last four top. That last four top is so profitable, and we need to make sure that we continue to create great value and we got to operate well. And I think that's the big thing out there today is that the operator -- I think casual dining restaurants and full-service restaurants in general is, we just need to operate better. I think we got sloppy during COVID. We've had to do things to just stay open and get by. We got to get sharp again. And I think our teams are doing a great job. But I think as an industry, we've got to earn the right from the consumer to pay what we're asking them to pay. And we've got to provide a really true full-service environment."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Raj Vennam",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results for the quarter, I want to expand on Gene and Rick's comments regarding the impact of Omicron and winter weather on our third quarter results. When looking at the fiscal months, actual sales for December and February were close to our internal expectations that were contemplated in the financial outlook we provided in December. And we met our profitability expectations in December and exceeded them in February. In fiscal January, however, we were significantly below our sales and profitability expectations as COVID cases surged, causing increased staffing shortages and reduced demand. We also experienced more severe winter weather than historical averages. As a result, sales were negatively impacted by over $100 million. This sales slowdown coupled with additional expenses related to sick pay, overtime and increased inflation, negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.30 and was more than 100 basis points drag on EBITDA margins for this quarter. Now turning to the detailed results for the quarter. Total sales for third quarter were $2.4 billion, 41% higher than last year, driven by 38% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 33 net new restaurants. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.93. Total EBITDA was $395 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 16.1%, 50 basis points better than pre-COVID. We continue to return significant cash to shareholders, paying $141 million in dividends and repurchasing $382 million in shares for a total of over $520 million cash returned to investors in the quarter. We ended the quarter with $555 million of cash on the balance sheet. We continue to see increasing cost pressure with inflation -- with total inflation of 7% this quarter, which was higher than our previous expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, we began taking additional pricing in the third quarter and have also implemented additional actions to further preserve the strength of our business model while balancing the impact to our guests. For the third quarter, total pricing was 3.7% and for the fourth quarter, we expect our pricing to be approximately 6% compared to last year. As a result, we now expect pricing to be just over 3% for the full fiscal year. This is well below our updated total inflation expectations of 6% for the year as we continue to execute our strategy of pricing below overall inflation to strengthen our value leadership position. Turning to our P&L and segment performance for the third quarter. We are comparing against pre-COVID results in the third quarter of 2020, which we believe are more comparable to normal business operations and with how we've been framing our margin expansion opportunity. For the third quarter, food and beverage expenses were 270 basis points higher, driven by elevated commodities inflation as well as investments in food quality, portion size and pricing significantly below inflation. Our commodity inflation this quarter was 11%. Restaurant labor was 50 basis points higher, driven by wage inflation, higher sick pay and overtime expense as a result of Omicron. Hourly wage inflation during the quarter was just over 9%. Restaurant labor as a percent of sales in fiscal December and February was better than pre-COVID as these months did not experience the same scale of headwinds from Omicron. Restaurant expenses were 80 basis points lower, as our teams continue to manage controllable expenses. Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 190 basis points of favorability. As a result, restaurant-level EBITDA margin for Darden was 19.4%, 50 basis points below pre-COVID levels for the quarter. However, both in December and February, restaurant-level EBITDA margins grew by almost 100 basis points compared to pre-COVID. G&A expense was 90 basis points lower, driven by savings from the corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021, a decrease in mark-to-market expense, lower travel expenses, and sales leverage. Turning to our segment performance. Sales and segment profit margins significantly increased versus last year for all of our segments. As we compare to pre-COVID, all segments, other than Olive Garden, grew sales. Olive Garden sales were slightly lower due to disproportionate impact Olive Garden experienced from the significant increase in COVID cases. This is because Olive Garden's geographic footprint and guest demographics make it more sensitive to COVID case counts. Additionally, Olive Garden continues to have significantly less marketing and promotional activity, which is a headwind to sales growth when comparing to pre-COVID. The January impact from Omicron I discussed earlier resulted in all of our segments experiencing lower segment profit margin in the quarter relative to pre-COVID.  Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. We updated our outlook for the full year to reflect our performance year-to-date and our expected performance for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.62 billion, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 29% to 30% and approximately 35 new restaurants; capital spending of approximately $425 million; total inflation of approximately 6%, with commodities inflation of approximately 9% and total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation approaching 9%; EBITDA of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion; an annual effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%; and approximately 129 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.30 and $7.45. This outlook implies full year EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID of roughly 200 basis points, still within our previous expected range. This outlook also implies fourth quarter sales between $2.52 billion and $2.59 billion and EPS between $2.13 and $2.28, which is higher than what was contemplated in the previous outlook we provided in December. As Gene said, our quarter-to-date average weekly sales are slightly ahead of February, and that is incorporated in this guidance. Looking forward to fiscal 2023, we're providing some preliminary guidance for a few items. We expect to open approximately 60 new units in fiscal 2023. We project total capital spending between $500 million and $550 million. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 14% for fiscal 2023. Now, I'll turn it back to Gene. Hi David. Good morning, this is Raj. So, let me just step back and talk about margins. When we began the year, obviously, things have changed quite a bit from the environment today relative to how we started the year is very different. We started the year with 3% inflation assumption and pricing closer to 1.5%. And here we are, three quarters in, we're looking at 6% total inflation, and our pricing has only gone up by about 1.5%. So, we started with 1.5% and now we're just over 3% for the full year and still are able to get to that 200 basis points. So, we really feel good about where we are getting to by the end of this year. We'll share more details in June call in terms of how we're thinking about fiscal 2023. But I think in the current environment, considering the situation we're in, we feel good about where we expect to be for this fiscal year. Yes, I think if you actually look back to what we've done over the last few quarters and actually last couple of years, we've taken very little pricing. We said all along that we wanted to preserve the flexibility. We wanted to -- we approach pricing very conservatively. And so we've been trying to hold off on pricing as much as the inflation would have dictated. And I think where we are now is 6%. While 6% seems high on -- in terms of how historically we price, considering the environment and considering what we're pricing over two years, we don't think it's too much. Obviously, we're going to continue to look for opportunities to price below inflation. And like I said earlier, this year, we're pricing 300 below. And as inflation creeps up, we're going to have to try to manage through that, but it's going to be a combination of pricing and productivity initiatives. John, we are obviously starting to have conversations. We have -- we are -- I would say, from a -- compared to historical situation, we're probably less contracted and we're working through those over the next few months, and we'll have more to share in June. But the forward premiums are too high to contract that far. Yes. On the expense side, I'd say just purely the expense part of it probably impacted our margins by about 20 to 30 basis points related to all the Omicron impact, whether it's overtime, sick pay or training, all that stuff is probably in that 20 to 30 basis points range. I remind you, that doesn't include the deleverage from sales mix. So that's the other part of it that impacts the margins, too. Yes, it was the impact of both in January. We were specifically referring to the impact in January, yes, from both. Yeah. I think, Chris, the way we've talked about before is our philosophy is generally to price less at casual dining. And obviously, that can vary from quarter-to-quarter. So I don't want to get into the exact specifics because these numbers change monthly, quarterly because it's a function of what we're wrapping on and how this goes. But generally speaking, there's a lot of science that goes into how we go about pricing and there are -- and that is very analytical, but there's also a lot of art that we've gained over time, the intuition that we've developed looking at data over time being in this business for a long time. I think it goes back -- some of that is that, but I think it goes back to the things that we did through COVID. A lot of the stuff is a continuation of what we've done with simplification. We continue to find opportunities to simplify. And then as Rick said in his comments, as we're hiring new people, our focus is on training them to be more productive. So there is a lot of new people in our system right now, and we want them to be at their best, and that takes time. Yeah. Nick, maybe I'll just dimensionalize it for you. When you look at our food basket, wheat makes up about 7%; call it, 2% to 3% is pasta related; and then the rest is bakery and bread. So that's really where the exposure to wheat directly is. We're continuing to see what happens in that market, and we'll work with our vendors to just make sure we get the best price we can in the environment we're in."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thanks Gene and good morning, everyone. Our restaurant teams are focused on executing at the highest level in creating exceptional experiences for every one of our guests. That's why we are committed to doing what it takes to have the people we need and the products our guests expect when they choose to dine with us. From a people perspective, we are seeing positive momentum in applicant numbers, and we feel much better about where we are now in terms of overall staffing. Our focus will continue to be on hiring and more importantly, training our new team members to reach the productivity level required to enable us to operate at optimum staffing levels. Our biggest staffing challenge during the quarter was managing the impacts of team member and manager exclusions due to Omicron. To provide some context, at the peak, team member exclusions in January were three times higher than the monthly peak we experienced with Delta. While we did get some help as the CDC guidelines for exclusion were reduced from 10 to five days, 8% of our total workforce was excluded at some point during January. To put a finer point on this, in the month of January, we had over 13,000 team members excluded for a total of more than 65,000 exclusion days. I am really proud of how our teams managed through the impacts of Omicron. As it moved across the country, we had some restaurants that were down as much as 40% of their staff and others that needed to limit their hours were temporarily moved to takeout only in order to operate effectively. As Omicron began to fade, our teams kept the same level of focus on staffing and training to provide a great guest experience, which resulted in record sales for fiscal February. Valentine's Day was strong across all our brands, and that is a testament to the excellent job our operators are doing to ensure their restaurants are staffed and ready to serve our guests. In fact, on Valentine's Day, Olive Garden served more than 1 million guests with approximately 35% of sales off-premise. On the product side, our supply chain team is working hard leveraging our scale to ensure our restaurants have the products they need to serve our guests. Our inventory levels remained strong and some of the logistical challenges we had been dealing with began to improve in December. However, Omicron impacted staffing for our supply chain partners in January as well. For labor intensive food production, this resulted in reduced supply and increased cost at a time when protein prices typically shift down from the heavy holiday buying season. Our distribution partners also experienced warehouse staffing challenges and driver shortages. Thus, we had expedited shipping costs and utilized more spot rate haulers in the quarter. Between those impacts and dealing with back-to-back winter storms, our team did an admirable job of maintaining supply continuity for our restaurants. Together, all of these factors increased our expected annual inflation, and Raj will provide more color on that in a moment. To Go sales remained strong during the quarter as our brand and our guests continue to benefit from the strength of our digital platform. Off-premise sales accounted for 30% of total sales at Olive Garden and 16% of total sales at Longhorn Steakhouse. Digital transactions accounted for 63% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 12% of Darden's total sales. Before I turn it over to Raj, I want to thank all of our team members who have shown tremendous resiliency and dedication in the face of constant change. Two years ago, we closed our dining room and did not know when we would be able to reopen them. Since then, we have dealt with multiple COVID waves, and our teams continue to demonstrate incredible flexibility and perseverance while creating exceptional guest experiences. Today, we are hopeful that we are near the end of the COVID-19 as a pandemic and that we will be able to live with like we do with other viruses. As I visit our restaurants and talk with our team members, they say each day feels a little more normal, and they are invigorated by the energy that has returned to our dining room. Our team members are the best in the business. I'm inspired by their winning spirit and confident that Darden's best days are ahead of us. Now I'll turn it over to Raj. Yeah, Brian. And I'll add to the current environment. As you think about what's going on in Ukraine, first of all, I want to say our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine, but the fact is we don't know how long the conflict is going to last. And so we don't know how long that's going to do anything to the environment itself. We're focused on controlling what we can control, confident in our ability to manage our business effectively in any operating environment. The other thing to think about is restaurant supply is down 13-ish%, 14% from pre-COVID. And so that gives people that want to go out, and people do want to go out, fewer options, and we are a great option for them. So -- and then last thing I'll say is you'll notice that our guidance range is a little bit wider than it normally would be in a quarter at the end. And that's just because of the uncertainty that we're feeling, but we feel good about the guidance we gave. We just gave a little bit bigger range just because of what we're going through today. Hey, Brett, it's Rick. And a couple of things on that question. So on the technology front we continue to have the same goal. It's implementing technology that reduces friction across the value chain, wherever that friction is, and responding to guest growing need for personalization. We don't anticipate using technology to take people out of the system because this is a full-service restaurant and full service company, and we believe that consumers want a human interaction. In terms of menu, we've been clear that we really like the reduction in menu and what it's done to provide our guests with the dishes they want at high-value dishes that they want and make it easier for our teams to produce them. And we can continue to get better. If we add new items, we take another item off. And so we're going to be consistent on making sure our menus stay at the levels they are today within a very small percentage up or down. On the controllables front, we still have some costs that will be coming in over time. But as we look to the future and project as we think about sales going forward, we would expect to get some productivity, but we don't think margin is going to be moving very much from where it is today. We'll talk about -- more about that in June as we think about our fiscal 2023. But just if you think about our long-term framework that we've had, it was 10 to 30 basis points of margin improvement. We got seven years of margin improvement in two years. And so we have to make sure that we manage that and consider that margin improvement we've made over the last couple of years. No, Brett, we haven't seen any movement. Hey, John, it's Rick. Thanks for the question. I will say we're not going to talk too much about 2023. But I will say, we've got contingency plans for anything. If the economy slows down, we've got some plans. We won't talk about what they are. If the economy stays strong, then we'll continue what we're doing. And so until we see what that is and where it is, we don't really want to comment on what we would do. Hey, Brian, we're continuing to build our pipeline for fiscal 2024 and beyond. And as we've said before, we'd like to get closer to the higher end of our long-term framework in the future. As we're seeing competition for sites, we aren't seeing as many people competing for sites, but there are still brands that are out there growing and competing for site. And so as we continue to build the pipeline, we will continue to compete for some of those sites. I will say, add to that, we are taking over some sites and building some restaurant and converting some to our brands at an economical rate. And they're really great sites. Those brands just didn't stay through. So we'll continue to build our pipeline. We still have some cost inflation in there, but our business model has improved so much that is offsetting that by more than enough. And we feel good that we'll continue to build our pipeline. Yes. It's going to be somewhere in the low single digits, maybe as much as 10, but lower single digits to as much as 10. Hey Jeff, thanks for the question. Gene and I are in the same place on what we believe with third-party delivery. We still don't like that model. We don't think it's the right thing for having someone get in between us and our guests, and a couple of points. Olive Garden has grown their To Go business significantly. And in many ways, faster than others have grown it with third-party delivery without that margin hit. Now, our takeout sales increased in Q3 from Q2, partly because of the influx of Omicron. And so people shifted again back to a To Go experience. We're seeing a little bit of a shift back to on-premise in Q4. We don't know where equilibrium is going to be. And when we get there, it will probably be higher than where we were before COVID, but it's not going to be at the levels they are today. And so we'll continue to make investments that we need to take the friction out of the order, pick up and pay experience so that people don't consider getting delivered. Now, you did ask about our delivery. We do have large party delivery for Olive Garden and that's a good business for us. It's a minimum order size. It gives us enough time to prep the order and deliver it to our guests and actually do a little bit more of a setup for it. I mean, so we really feel good about that business, but we never say never, but the likelihood of us getting into third-party delivery anytime soon is pretty low. Yes, Dennis, this is Rick. Thanks for the question on the staffing side. We feel -- as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel much better about where we are in our staffing today than we did three months ago and three months before that. We continue to add around 10,000 people working per quarter, basically at the end of the quarter from the quarter before. Our staffing levels are greater than 95% of pre-COVID staffing levels. We don't need as many people as we did before because of our productivity enhancement. That said, we want to make sure that our team members that we have are fully trained and productive. And as we said, exclusions were pretty tough in the month of January, especially. In terms of wage inflation, we are, as we said, seeing a continued increase on applicant flow. And so while it hasn't reversed kind of the starting wage trends, it's actually starting to stabilize, but we don't know where that's going to land. But right now, it's starting to stabilize a little bit. And we'll know more as that applicant flow continues to pick up and people feel more comfortable working again after -- as Omicron hopefully become more of an endemic versus a pandemic. Yeah, Dennis, our thoughts haven't changed as the economic environment continued to struggle over time, as Omicron picked up, more restaurant close. I mean, so there are fewer restaurants today than there were last month and the month before and the month before that. They'll eventually get filled. And our -- what we want to do is be there to fill some of those restaurants and pick up that market share. As we think about the future, we've said that we're going to increase -- hopefully get to the high end of our framework and new units. But those restaurants will eventually come back and be better than they were before. Our restaurants will be better than maybe the ones that were closed. Hey, Chris, we haven't really seen a big impact in our internal data on a change in value perception at Olive Garden. We track both on-premise and off-premise. Olive Garden continues to increase their overall satisfaction from five years ago. There's a slope up versus most customers are actually more dissatisfied across the American consumer satisfaction index. We're bucking that trend. All of our brands are bucking that trend. And so we haven't seen a big change in value ratings for Olive Garden, and we'll continue to monitor that. We don't think the pricing actions that we have taken are going to change that dramatically because we're still, as Raj had mentioned, much lower than most full-service restaurants combined over a two-year period. Yeah, Chris, as you mentioned, we are lower in marketing spend than we were pre-COVID. We're going to continue to wait for the equilibrium. I'm really proud of the work that Dan and his team has done, keeping with our strategy. And so we have been marketing. But we're marketing our Never Any First Course to remind everybody about the value they get every day at Olive Garden. We're not doing promotional marketing, but we're talking about the value they get every day. And we'll continue to look at our marketing spend over time. And if the time we bring that back up, we would expect to earn a return on that, as we said on the last call. We feel Olive Garden is large, and one of their advantages is their scale, means that we will be marketing at Olive Garden. We just want to find the right time to continue to increase that, but it probably won't get all the way back to pre-COVID levels, but we'll see where equilibrium comes. Yes, Eric, this is Rick. I'll talk about the sustainability. We've guided where -- what we think our Q4 will be, and that includes everything we know today. And it talks about what our comp sales will be and what our total sales will be, which was higher than what we would have guided in December for Q4. There might be some pent-up demand for Omicron, but there's enough demand for COVID. And it might have been Omicron, but it's other things. And so we're going to continue to see what the equilibrium is. We keep coming back to that word equilibrium. What do we look like when everything is back to a more normal state, and it's a steady state. And we're not there yet. We've got geopolitical risk and other things, which is, again, why we have a wider range in our outlook for Q4 than we normally would at this time. Yes, turnover levels in the last -- you think about turnover the way we manage it. It's over a 12-month period, and you've got a lot of kind of fluctuation over time. But turnover levels are getting a little bit better for us in the long versus where we were just a few months back and months before that. We still have 90-day turnover at a higher level than we'd like it to be. So that's why we're focusing more on training even more and specifically on our new team members to make sure they get up to speed and they understand what our business is all about. And I'll let Raj talk about the other part. Yes, Nicole. We are really pleased with the strategy that we have. We believe that it's better to provide an experience with a great guest experience that are people -- or people, our core guests that are willing to pay for that experience. And we would rather not discount. We took out all discounting out of Olive Garden in all of our brands at COVID. I mean we haven't added that back. Others have started to add that back, but we are continuing to maintain our strategy of keeping the discounts out of our brand. Again, as the environment changes, if the environment changes, we will consider anything, but we have a lot of options. Our biggest option is to increase our marketing spend, whether it's -- even undiscounted just to get our strategy, our message out at Olive Garden of a never-ending first course. That is a great value. And as we think about limited time offers in the future, if we have them, they'll be at a different construct than we had before. But again, when equilibrium comes and we know which way we go, that's when we'll act. Hey Nicole, Cheddar's is a great value. That is their advantage as well, value. And we're continuing to improve the experience at Cheddar's, improve the food, improve the service experience while keeping prices much lower and pricing much lower than our competition, which is just going to improve the value perception even more. Cheddar's doesn't have as much scale to do kind of the TV kind of advertising. Our best advertising at Cheddar's is when you get your check and you see the price that you're paying and you tell your friends. We're going to continue to do that and find other ways with digital and other things if we need to, to ramp up marketing in our brands. And in terms of new unit growth, those pipelines take a while to build, right? So, we're building them now. You can't kind of turn on a dime if the consumer gets a little weaker and say we're just going to open that quite a few more of one brand versus the other. But we believe in Cheddar's, and we believe that they have a lot of growth ahead of them. And we're going to continue to build a pipeline of people and of restaurant to capture that opportunity. Yes, I don't think there's a limiter of how high the digital mix will go other than 100%. But there are still people that want to call in and dial in and pick up their order. They may not be as comfortable with the technology. We're trying to make it as seamless and smooth as possible. But we're even making that experience better for the people that dial in, how do they pay and how do they pick up. So, we're doing things on the technology front that maybe they don't see as much, but that we can get better so that they can still do the dial-ins for us. We would like to see the digital percentage continue to grow as part of off-premise. It just simplifies the operation in the restaurant. There's fewer things that the team members have to do to pick up the phone, et cetera. But there are some long-standing guests that just like to call, and we'll continue to offer that service to them. We will not eliminate dial-in to get the percentages up. These percentages have grown because of the investments that we've made and will continue to make. And hopefully, they'll continue to grow. Andrew, we're not going to talk as much about what's going on in 2023. I will say that whatever the environment looks like, whether we need to drive more dine-in sales versus off-premise, we'll do. We don't really do a lot of digital marketing on the off-premise, so most of our marketing is for on-premise. And so if we do any off-premise marketing, it will be an increase. So pretty much most of our marketing is -- I'm sorry, if we do any off-premise marketing, it will be the increase. Most of our marketing is on-premise. Yeah, Lauren, we really like the way our menu works right now and the taste in our food. So we don't have a -- we don't expect to go in there and change ingredients significantly to offset some of these costs. We'll continue to work with our supply chain partners to get the best prices that we can get for the product. I will say, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're going to do whatever it takes to get the products that our consumers value and that our consumers expect to have when they come in to eat with us. We're hoping that eventually this inflation environment gets a little bit better, but we think we can compete in whatever environment there is. Yes, John, to answer the question directly, I think we can get better, continue to get better with this class because of the menu simplification we've made. When reducing our menus the way we did has made it a lot easier to run a restaurant. The managers spend a little less time on individual items and teaching people on these items that we didn't produce very often. I mean we just get better at producing the same things over and over again, which are the things that our guests want. We've had a couple of things that have happened through COVID that have been good for us. One is we've hired some folks that maybe we wouldn't have looked at before, maybe it's her first job. But giving someone their first job and teaching them to do the things the way we do it is a good thing for us. Maybe in the past, we would have said, 'You needed to have a lot of experience in a restaurant before you come to work for ours.' But we're seeing that some of these folks that we're hiring that are new to work, we're teaching them how to work the way we want them to work and it's actually working out for us pretty well. We also have seen a lot of rehires. A lot of people are coming back to work for us that have left us over time. And a lot of our managers are rehires. And so while people may have left the industry during COVID, a lot of them are coming back, and we feel really good about the fact that they're coming back to work for us. Hey, David, let me just say how proud I am of John Wilkerson and his team and what they've done over COVID over two years of significantly changing the business model at Cheddar's to make it a much more investable proposition for us. As we said in one of the earlier questions, kind of the new unit opening range of low single digits to high -- to up to 10, we'll probably open more than we've had since we bought them. And we'll continue to build that pipeline as we continue to strengthen the team. The great thing that they have done is build the team to be ready to open restaurants. And that wasn't ready when we got them. And so, I can't tell you how big Cheddar's will be, but I can tell you that they have a big addressable population. The values that they provide, the value that they provide for the consumer and the food that they have, means there's a lot of Cheddar's that can be built out there. How many? I can't tell you until we get some more of these open. I will say, the restaurants that we've opened through COVID had done really well for us, and we feel really good about the fact that we can open more Cheddar's. Yes, David. If you think about our acquisition strategy, we've made four big acquisitions since 2007. And that should still be part of our strategy going forward. We've proven that we can get synergies. And we've proven over time, it takes a while that we get these brands up and running and ready to go and grow. But our management team and Board regularly evaluate that, and nothing is going to change as we go forward. We believe Darden is a platform, a platform that can add brands that help Darden grow and continue to build our biggest advantage, which is scale. Hi, Jared. As we think about our strategy and value proposition, it's really what we've been talking about for years in our basic, simple operating philosophy: food, service and atmosphere. We're going to continue to invest in food, make it better and make it more consistent every time you come into one of our restaurants. We're going to continue to improve our service, and we're going to make sure our atmospheres are great. In terms of -- while we, again, price, continue to price, is our expectation below our competition and below inflation, we believe that, that is the best way to build value. Loyalty, we've looked at that before. We may look at it again. I'm not quite sure that, that's where the value comes from is to give a discount to your highest core consumers. Our goal is to build an additional visit to our core consumers, and we've been doing that without discounting because we're giving them what they want at a price that they think is a fair value for them and a great value for them. And we'll continue to do that going forward. Jake, in terms of kind of the pent-up demand over -- for COVID versus Omicron, yes, we're seeing some consumers that haven't been with us for a couple of years in our dining rooms and are dining, right? So, there were -- there are still a percentage of people that didn't feel comfortable going out even as Delta kind of waned and people thought maybe COVID was kind of done at that time. And so we're still seeing guests that are coming back and there'll probably be some more that come back. We're still a little skewed. If we think about our skew of demographics, we're still a little bit lower in our mix of those over 65 because, I think, they felt a little bit less comfortable, but that mix is getting better. And in terms -- I forgot the second part. Yes, in terms of geography, the geography piece, I'm sorry, Yes, I don't think we're going to get into the geography in just three weeks, right, quarter-to-date. I will say that the geographic impact in Q3 were much more related to Omicron than they were for anything else, depending on what that geographic region felt about COVID versus not, but not getting into kind of the gas prices in just a really short period of time because they're already -- the gas prices kind of moved up and moved down a little bit over those three weeks. Yes, Jake, we're not really seeing a big material difference in consumers through February, March based on anything that's going on in the geopolitical environment or what's going on with inflation. Sure."

You may begin.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me on the call today are; Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardenas, President and COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of those measurements are included in the presentation. Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing second quarter performance as a comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. This is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic impact on the business and limited capacity environment that we operated in during the second quarter of fiscal '21. We plan to release fiscal 2022 third quarter earnings on Thursday, March 24 before the market opens, followed by a conference call. This morning, Gene will share some brief remarks, Rick will give an update on our operating performance and Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2022 financial outlook. Now I'll turn the call over to Gene.\nGene Lee: Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, we had a fantastic quarter. Sales trends remained strong throughout the quarter as all our brands stayed laser-focused on creating memorable guest experiences. Despite the toughest inflationary environment we've seen in years, we achieved strong profitable sales growth. Our ongoing success navigating the pandemic is a testament to the power of our strategy driven by our back-to-basics operating philosophy and the strength of our 4 competitive advantages. Our disciplined commitment to our strategy has allowed us to manage this environment well, while returning significant cash to our shareholders. People and product will continue to be our focus and Rick will share more details about that in a minute. Additionally, our teams have done a great job managing inflation effectively, and Raj will provide more color on that during his remarks. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they delight our guests and help create lasting holiday memories. This time of year, is also a great reminder that being of service is at the heart of our business, which is why we're committed to serving our guests, our team members and our communities. One of the ways we serve our communities is by helping fight hunger. This fiscal year through our foundation, Darden provided $2.5 million to help our partners at Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for 15 food banks to support mobile pantry programs, and distribution in communities facing high rates of food insecurity. We are uniquely positioned to help, and by leveraging our scale and relationships with partners like Penske Truck Leasing and Lineage Logistics, we're proudly doing our part to help get food into the hands of people who need it. On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our team members for everything you do to serve our guests, and our communities. And I wish you all a wonderful holiday season. Finally, earlier today, we announced that effective May 30, Rick will succeed me as Chief Executive Officer and will join Darden's Board of Directors. This is the right time for this transition, and I look forward to continuing to serve as Darden's Chairman. Our company is in a clear position of strength, and this is also the right time for me and my family. I'm excited for Rick, who's been a tremendous partner over the last seven years, and is one of the best strategic thinkers I've worked alongside. Our brands have tremendous opportunity ahead of them, and Rick is the perfect person to lead Darden into the next chapter. On behalf of the Board, Darden's management team and our 170,000 team members, I want to congratulate Rick, and wish him all the best. Rick?\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Gene. Good morning, everyone. It is an honor to be appointed Darden's next Chief Executive Officer, and I'm grateful to Gene and the Board for their confidence in me. It is humbling to lead 170,000 outstanding team members who nourish and delight everyone we serve. I was incredibly fortunate to work with each of Darden's CEOs, so I have a strong appreciation for the legacy of leadership I am inheriting. By upholding our commitment to operational excellence, and maximizing the power of the Darden platform, we will continue to execute our strategy to drive growth and shareholder value. Turning to the quarter. Our restaurants continue to execute at a high level. Our focus on simplifying operations to drive execution remains our top priority, which is why we once again paused any new initiatives during the quarter in order to eliminate distractions and allow our operators to focus on running great shifts. This pause also ensures they can zero in on people and product, as we navigate through the current staffing and supply chain challenges. From a people perspective, we feel good about the progress we've made on the staffing front. Across our brands, manager staffing levels are above historical norms, and team member staffing levels continue to improve. Our new hiring system has made it easier to source talent, giving our management teams more time to focus on successfully onboarding and training new team members. We also continue to invest in our team members, further strengthening our industry-leading employment proposition. Earlier this year, we committed to increasing the minimum hourly earnings for our restaurant team members to $12, which includes income earned through gratuities by January 2023. However, given the strength of our performance, we are accelerating that timing to January 2022. This primarily impacts entry-level roles such as hosts, busters and dishwashers. And with this change, we expect our restaurant team members will earn, on average, approximately $20 per hour. Our people are the key to our performance. We work hard to be the employer of choice in our industry, and we're proud that our retention rates for managers and team members are both in the top quartile, and we will continue to invest in them to retain and attract the best talent in the industry. On the product side, our supply chain team continues to do a great job, making sure our restaurants have the products they need to serve our guests. Our inventory levels are strong, and the team's ability to meet the needs of the business can be seen in the fact that we shipped more cases in the last two quarters than at any time during Darden's history. The ability to maintain supply continuity for our restaurants minimizes distractions and allows our operators to focus on executing at the highest level, whether our guests are in our dining rooms or enjoying the convenience of To Go. During the quarter, To Go sales continued to benefit from the strength of our digital platform. This platform not only makes it easier for our teams to execute, it makes it more convenient for our guests to visit, order, pay and pick up. Off-premise sales accounted for 28% of total sales at Olive Garden and 15% of total sales at LongHorn Steakhouse. Digital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales during this quarter and 11% of Darden's total sales. Finally, we successfully opened 12 new restaurants during the quarter, including a flagship Yard House in Times Square, with minimal staffing challenges. The time to build a new restaurant is longer today than it has been historically, and we are also beginning to see longer lead times for kitchen equipment and technology hardware. Regardless, we remain on track to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year. To wrap up, I also want to recognize our team members in our restaurants and our support center, for your tireless efforts in creating exceptional experiences for our guests. I wish you all a safe and happy holiday season. Now I'll turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, 37% higher than last year, driven by 34.4% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. Average weekly sales grew by more than 7% compared to pre-COVID. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.48. Total EBITDA was $335 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 14.7%. The significant business model improvements we made over the past year and half, combined with strong sales, resulted in margin growth of 270 basis points compared to pre-COVID. We expect this to be the highest quarterly EBITDA margin growth this fiscal year as this quarter has the most opportunity given its low seasonality. We continue to return significant cash to shareholders, paying $143 million in dividends and repurchasing $266 million in shares, totaling over $400 million of cash returned to investors in the quarter. And while we're happy with our performance, cost pressures continue to exceed our expectations on both commodities and labor with total inflation of 6% this quarter. Our teams continue to demonstrate agility in managing through this environment. This quarter, we implemented several mitigating actions to preserve the strength of our business model while balancing the impact to our guests and team members. One of these actions was taking additional pricing. For the second quarter, total pricing was 2%, and we expect back half pricing to approach 4%, resulting in total pricing of just under 3% for the full fiscal year. We continue to execute our strategy of pricing significantly below our overall inflation to strengthen our value leadership position by leveraging our scale. This level of pricing covers most of what we consider to be the structural and long-lasting impacts of the current inflationary environment, and absorbing what we consider to be more short-term fluctuations, while providing future flexibility should there be a need. For the rest of the fiscal year, we expect commodity and labor inflation to peak in our third quarter and then start to slow down as we enter the fourth quarter, and lap commodities inflation of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. Now turning to our P&L and segment performance for the second quarter. We're comparing against pre-COVID results in the second quarter of 2020, which we believe are more comparable to normal business operations, and with how we've been framing our margin expansion opportunity. For the second quarter, food and beverage expenses were 220 basis points higher, driven by elevated commodity inflation of 9% as well as investments in food quality, portion size and pricing significantly below inflation. Restaurant labor was 90 basis points favorable, driven by sales leverage and efficiencies gained from operational simplifications, and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures. Hourly wage inflation during the quarter was almost 9%. Restaurant expenses were 130 basis points lower due to sales leverage, which more than offset higher utilities costs. Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 230 basis points of favorability. As a result, restaurant-level EBITDA margin for Darden was 18.8%, 230 basis points better than pre-COVID levels. G&A expense was 40 basis points lower, driven by savings from the corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021, a decrease in mark-to-market expense and sales leverage. Turning to our segment performance. Second quarter sales at Olive Garden increased 5% versus pre-COVID, strong performance, especially as we were wrapping against nine weeks of never-ending possible. This sales growth, combined with the business model improvements at Olive Garden, helped drive a segment profit margin increase of 320 basis points, even while offsetting elevated inflation. LongHorn continued its strong sales growth with an increase of 22% versus pre-COVID. However, inflationary pressures, including double-digits for commodities, were at their highest level in the second quarter, resulting in reduction of segment profit margin by 80 basis points. Sales at our Fine Dining segment increased 22% versus pre-COVID, as this segment continues to see a strong rebound in performance. Segment profit margin grew by 140 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodities inflation. Our other segment grew sales by 7% versus pre-COVID and segment profit margin by 250 basis points. This segment continues to perform well, and we're pleased to see the business model transformation persist. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. We updated our outlook for the full-year to reflect our performance year-to-date and our expected performance for the remainder of the year. We now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11% from pre-COVID levels. Same-restaurant sales growth of 29% to 31%, and 35% to 40% new restaurants. Capital spending of approximately $425 million. Total inflation of approximately 5.5%, with commodities inflation between 7% and 8%. Total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation approaching 9%. EBITDA of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion, and the annual effective tax rate of approximately 14%, and approximately 130 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.35 and $7.60. This outlook implies EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID, similar to our previous outlook of 200 to 250 basis points with flow-through from pricing and higher sales, helping offset elevated inflation. Now we'll take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brian Bittner at Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you so much for the question and good morning. And first and foremost, congratulations to both Gene and Rick on the big announcement today. Gene, I know this is not goodbye yet, but I just want to say, it's truly been a pleasure as an analyst to witness what you've done to reshape and better position the Darden enterprise over the last seven years. My question is related to pricing and cost. And it's not surprising that you moved your total cost inflation guidance up a bit given the turbulent environment, but your EBITDA margin guidance at its midpoint is unchanged versus your prior inflation guidance. So you're obviously taking a bit more price, which you talked about in your prepared remarks. Should we interpret these actions as a firm commitment to the EBITDA margin goals that you've been talking about? And are you confident that you have the pricing levers if it's something you need to continue to use in the future to hold the line on these margins? Or is this about as far as you want to go on pricing for the foreseeable future? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Hi, Brian, this is Raj. I think as you alluded to, we have - we committed to the 200 to 250 at the beginning of the year, and we've shown through the two quarters now that we're adjusting our business model, adjusting our thinking on pricing based on where our business model is coming out. So as we look at our P&L, we continue to look at opportunities to manage costs better. And we are focused on doing some of that before we take pricing. But with that said, we preserved a lot of flexibility, and we have - and we are tapping into some of that. But we do believe we have more dry powder if needed. And I think the way we're thinking about it is really some of these excess sales are going to help offset some of this elevated inflation. The other piece I mentioned in my prepared remarks was that we're really focused on pricing to cover for the structural parts of it, and then trying to kind of weather through the short-term fluctuations. And - but we are committed to the margin growth.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Charles at Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: First and foremost, echo Brian. Gene, congrats on a story career, not just at Darden, but RARE as well. And Rick, congrats to you as well for a very deserved promotion. I had two questions. The first one is Olive Garden saw steady improvement on a two-year basis in 2Q without really changing the advertising and promotional strategy much. And as you guys mentioned, really focusing on operations. And as we're - at the start here of calendar 2022, how do you think about the competitive environment changes that are likely to occur this year? And how this will impact your marketing promotion plans that thus far, really not changed that much over the last few months?\nRick Cardenas: Andrew, this is Rick. First of all, I just want to say how proud I am of the work that Dan and his team has done, keeping with our strategy. We did have trends improved in Q2, and we exceeded industry 2 year comp growth. So thanks for noticing that. I think one of the things that we've been thinking about through marketing spend is we're going to continue to look for equilibrium and react accordingly to whatever happens in the marketplace. Advertising will always be a part of Darden's mix because of the scale advantage they have. And if and when we increase our marketing spend we'd expect it to earn a return compared to where we were if we didn't have any marketing spend. So we're going to continue to see what happens. We don't - we know that there's some advertisers out there with some heavy TRPs. We had $44 million less in media this quarter than we did two years ago. And we feel good about where we were.\nAndrew Charles: Then Rick, just a follow-up question. The Olive Garden off-premise to 28% was pretty steady from 1Q to 2Q. This had been decelerating in quarters before that as the dine-in business picked up. And I know historically, you'd said longer term Olive Garden off-premise sales would likely settle at 20%, at least. But as the recent experience led you to believe that off-premise mix can perhaps be 25% plus longer term?\nRick Cardenas: Andrew, yes, you mentioned our To Go sales at Olive Garden were a little bit higher than they were in Q1. We had a - this is a typically lower volume quarter for us and the To Go sales stayed up there. So that helped our total percentage. To answer your question about what we expect it to be, we do expect it to be higher than our 20% that we said. It is a little bit stickier than we thought. You guys were all right about that, a little stickier than we thought. We're not going to necessarily say, we should expect to be at 25%, but probably above 20%.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Eric Gonzalez at KeyBanc Markets.\nEric Gonzalez: Thanks for the question. I'd also like to give my congratulations to Gene and to Rick. My question is it looks like November was a relatively strong month for the industry as the Knapp-Track accelerates to a little over 6%. And can you talk about the sustainability of that trend line? How much of a pull forward of demand is that given the earlier holiday shopping? And maybe which of your brands might have benefited more from that phenomenon?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Eric. Yes, we saw the same increase in November that the industry did. And as I said, Olive Garden was ahead of the industry, and so with LongHorn. What I would say is it's too early to tell if it was a pull forward from shopping. We do know that retail sales were a little bit more online this year than a normal kind of after Thanksgiving, and some of the retailers were closed on Thanksgiving Day. But it's too early to tell about that. We do have a shift, as we've said before, that Thanksgiving shifted back into our second quarter from our third quarter two years ago, and we're seeing that kind of impact this quarter. So still too early to tell, but the holidays do lineup pretty well for us. I will caveat all that by saying weather is the biggest fluctuation in this quarter, and we'll see what happens. If weather hits during a holiday period, then that could be a little bit of a challenge on the comp.\nEric Gonzalez: And then just on the seasonality of the business. I think Raj was talking about how EBITDA growth was highest in the second quarter. I'm guessing there's a lot of staffing that needs to happen during the holiday period, just given that the overall number of crew members is higher. So can you talk about what the margin implications are for the third quarter? And how staffing in this environment might impact the margins?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Eric, I think when you think about Q3, it's historically has been a strong seasonal quarter, right? From - the volumes are higher. Our margins are really high. I mean if you go back to pre-COVID, I think we were in the 15-plus range for the third quarter when our annual was around 14%. So the point I think we're trying to make here is that, once you start approaching that 17-plus percent, it starts to get harder-and-harder. So that's really what we're trying to talk about is that, there was a lot more opportunity in Q2, because you're able to leverage that low volume period some of the fixed costs better, and it just gets harder-and-harder when you're at the high volume. The staffing is higher. We do staff - we want to staff - over staff, especially during peak periods, during the holidays, so that's part of that. But overall, 17-plus is - starts to get harder.\nOperator: We'll go next to Chris O'Cull with Stifel.\nChris O'Cull: Thanks for taking the question. I'd also like to congratulate Gene and Rick. Gene, it's been a pleasure to follow the success you've had over the past 20 years, covering RARE and Darden. So, congrats. So, Rick, given the promotional level remains low at Olive Garden, was the acceleration in the comps you think due more to an improvement in staffing and capacity utilization quarter-to-quarter? Or have you seen customers really start to respond to some of the ongoing quality improvements the company has made there? Hello? [technical difficulty]\nOperator: Standby. Just one moment, Chris. And you, Rick join.\nRick Cardenas: Sorry about that, guys. Sorry. Chris thanks a lot for the question. This is Rick. As a reminder, the second quarter is our lowest seasonal quarter. We did run NAPB two years ago. So, we're really proud of the fact that we comped over two years ago without never any possible running. And this was really aided by the point you made up in staffing, aided by productivity enhancements we made during the quarter, and the fact that our two - new team members were moving up the learning curve more quickly and becoming more productive. And there could be something about vaccination rates being above Q1 levels, so maybe people are more comfortable dining out. And the fact that we have, as you mentioned, made these investments in our core items. They are: we've made great investments in the items that people really want. The value ratings are great, and we're just executing at a high level.\nChris O'Cull: That's helpful. And then just one other question related to commodity inflation. I don't know if this is for Rick or Raj, but I'm wondering if you have any insights into how processors, packers, distributors are going to pass through the inflation that they're experiencing. And what I'm trying to understand is how much commodity inflation could be permanent versus temporary? And whether you believe restaurants can get back to that kind of pre-COVID cost of sales if commodity prices were at comparable levels to that period?\nGene Lee: Chris, it's Gene. Let me just jump in here. And I think about this, the commodity infrastructure pre-COVID was able to feed the world without a lot of inflation. And that's what the world getting richer. And so, I believe that the commodity infrastructure will get back to an equilibrium where we'll be able to produce the food needed to feed everyone. And I don't think there'll be a lot of inflation in that. I think where the inflation is going to come in, in commodities is going to be whatever labor impact there is to grow and deliver that food. And so, I think we still have 12 to 18 months to - for that to all work its way out. But there was something happening over the last decade where we weren't seeing a tremendous amount of inflation in food. And I think it had to do with technology and other aspects. And I think that all that global capabilities are still there. And so, I'd just end by saying what we don't know is - what - how much labor is involved in each product to grow and deliver and harvest, and so on and so forth? And what are the impacts the labor is going to have on the commodities. And so, I think we're in a wait and see - I don't know - I mean I think the end of your question was, we're going to get COGS back to historical levels. Yes, I think over time, it will take time, but I think these models will all drift back to the same what I would call prime cost model, we add labor and COGS.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Well, good morning and hats-off, Gene, and congrats, Rick as well. Gene or Rick, first, just on - can you talk about the wage increases. I guess broadly, when I see a number like $12 an hour, when you compare it to other retailers or even some others and other segments in retail of restaurants, it still seems low, I know you're top quartile payer in your industry. Do you think the casual dining industry in general, though, is maybe underpaying relative to others in retail, and there's the need just to continue to advance that? And maybe if you could just unpack the 12 - the hybrid number it includes gratuities. So maybe what is the back of the house starting wages, for example, just so we can maybe better benchmark without including the gratuities which we don't really have exactly a handle on.\nGene Lee: Yeah. John, I think where I'd start was, we basically said, we expect our average to be approximately $20 after this goes into effect. Now very few people in our company make minimum wage. This is what I would call an entry-level wage, and more rural America. And so - in the major cities, you're not hiring anybody for $12 an hour today. This is an increase in the guarantee to our workforce, will probably have more impact on Cheddar's than any of our other brands. And so starting wages or wage rates very, very, very much depending on geography and overall demand. We have people that - in our environment that make $25 to $28 an hour in the back of the house. And in some parts of the country, you're doing that same job for $18 an hour depending on the environment. And so I don't believe - in your macro question around this casual dining paying too little, I don't think that's true. I think casual dining is paying the appropriate rates in the marketplace based on supply and demand. And I think that - I think our teams are doing a very, very good job of looking at the overall situation and ensuring that we're paying probably a little bit more of the competitive wage in each market to ensure that our restaurants are fully staffed. And we're encouraged by Rick's comments that our restaurants today are better staff than they were last quarter and they're better staff in the quarter before. And we still have strong, strong retention rates. And I think that the way we think about it - I'll leave you with this, the way we think about it is that there may not be enough service workers to staff every restaurant in America, but there's enough service workers out there to staff Darden's restaurants, and that's what we're focused on.\nJohn Glass: That's great to hear. One follow-up, Rick, I think you mentioned putting on pause some initiatives to focus on operations right now. What are some examples of those initiatives that you've put on pause? Are they sales-driving initiatives that we could think about coming back over time? Are they more marginally - I don't know what they are, but what maybe is some examples of those? And when do you think they come back?\nRick Cardenas: I think about a couple of things that are not directly related to training and staffing. So those initiatives, we're still working on making sure that we've got our restaurants staffed and we've got our restaurants staffed and we've got our people trained. But things like new product development, that for years, we've done a lot of new development, but we're focusing on just developing one or two products a year that are really great. And so we thought it was right for us to not go ahead and do that during this time when we can keep managers focused entirely on staffing their restaurant, making sure they train their people. So that's an example. We're still doing a lot of things here in the support center that are getting ready to gear up, a lot on the technology front, but that was one example.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Peter Saleh at BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you and good morning and congrats to both Gene and Rick. A couple of questions on my end. I think you guys mentioned longer lead times to open units, really getting some of the equipment in there. Can you give us a little bit more color on that? Are we talking weeks or months? And do you see any end to that? Is that something that you think persists for a while? Or is that kind of more short-term in nature?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, this is Rick. We're talking weeks, not months, a couple of weeks here or there. We may have a restaurant or two that might go a little bit longer than that, but on average, we're a few weeks. And we are starting to order a lot of these long lead time items a lot sooner, and actually holding them in inventory, which not driving our inventory costs up, but making sure that we have the kitchen equipment to open the restaurant when the restaurant is ready to open. So not very long.\nPeter Saleh: And then just lastly on my end. Is there any other technology or any other processes that you guys are implementing or looking at maybe kitchen equipment or other that could help reduce some of the labor hours necessarily in the restaurant?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Peter. We've always focused on our technology in three places, and I'll talk about the two big ones, guest-facing and restaurant technology. So if you think about what we're doing on the restaurant side. We are doing a lot of things to help improve productivity, simplifying processes for managers so that they don't have to hunt and pack and do other things so that they can spend their time training their people. But we don't foresee bringing in technology that will reduce the number of people that we need to do the job. We are a full-service restaurant company, and we're going to maintain that to provide the service that our guests expect. We will bring technology into help that, but not to necessarily replace.\nGene Lee: Peter, one of the things that I think that's most interesting is machine learning for forecasting, forecasts forecasting our business is - forecasting our restaurant business is one of the most important things that we do every single day. And we think there's some real upside in the machine learning around that, and our team has developed some pretty slick stuff. And I'm fairly excited about that potential. That turns into productivity. If you can predict your business correctly, then you can really increase your productivity at the store level.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Carroll at RBC Capital Markets.\nChris Carroll: Thanks and good morning. And I also want to echo my congratulations to both Gene and Rick on the announcement today. So just following up on pricing. Clearly, a still challenging cost environment, but curious to hear how you're thinking, how you expect today's pricing levels to be received by guests. And how does that pricing flow through the different brands? Are you expecting to take relatively more pricing at your higher-end brands, while keeping pricing closer to historical levels for the others?\nGene Lee: Yes. Hey, Chris, yes, let me start with the latter question, first. Yes, we do. So when you look at our overall pricing, I'd say you almost you can assume that Olive Garden and Cheddar's are going to be below the Darden level of pricing and all other brands are going to be higher. Obviously, the spectrum being the fine dining will probably have the highest pricing. As far as the guest reactions, obviously, we track this over time. One of the things we noticed - one of the key factors is how much do you price relative to CPI. And I think as we look at how we have been pricing we've been pricing a lot below that. That helps - that gives us a lot more comfort in the fact that the elasticity - we're not hitting that portion of that curve that's actually more elastic. So at this point, the level of pricing we have is significantly below CPI, which means it's fairly inelastic impact.\nChris Carroll: And just as a follow-up, at the risk of asking this question too early, but can you provide us with any sense on whether you're seeing any shift in guest behavior in recent weeks in response to just latest COVID concerns perhaps any observations on a regional basis that would suggest there is or is not any change in demand levels today? That would be helpful. Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes. I would - that's a pretty simple answer, no. We haven't seen any change in behaviors in the regional. It's real early in this - what seems to be this next wave. I mean I think if you study the New York Times map, you could see this surge heading towards New England for a few weeks now. And so that's been a part of the country that's been most sensitive into, maybe what I would call, overreacting. So - but we'll see. I mean we - as of today, we haven't seen any big change I would just say that there's significant COVID fatigue out there, and it's going to take a lot to modify a certain percentage of the population's behavior. There's a certain percentage of the population that is going to react to this, but there's a certain set of it that's just going to continue on. All you got to do is look at stadiums and concert halls to see who those people are.\nOperator: We'll go next to Brett Levy at MKM.\nBrett Levy: Great. Thank you. And best of luck to everyone in their next endeavors. So thanks, Rick. Thanks, Gene. When you think about the guidance items that you provided, and obviously, you've unpacked a lot with the commodity and the inflationary talk on labor. Where do you still see the greatest opportunities beyond the sales line to improve your fundamentals at the unit level? And when you think about your CapEx, you obviously raised it to the high end. Can you walk us through how you're thinking about where that comes from, and just your capital thoughts for the year? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Yes. Brett, it's Gene. I'll start with the fundamentals. I think the fundamentals for us right now is how do we bring along the most - the population of new employees - the percentage of the population of new employees, how do we bring them along. And as Rick said earlier, make them as productive as possible we can and bring our brands to life the way we wanted to do so. And as we head into the busiest part of the year, we're just laser focused on trying to keep things simple and ensure that we can execute at a high level. We know that our competitors are having similar - the same problems that we have, and our goal is to out-execute them and win guest loyalty through this very difficult period of time. And so I think that's really where our advantage is right now. We're better staffed. We've got - we're doing great training, and we're really confident that we're executing at a high level, and that's what our - that's what our research is telling us. Raj, you want to take the CapEx?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Look, clearly, in this environment with inflation, there are construction costs on the CapEx that are going up a little bit. But overall, CapEx levels given - while they are higher related - what we said was the high end of the guidance we had provided earlier, the efficiency of this capital spend is still very high. We're actually still - especially with the improvements we made at the unit level, the returns are really strong. So even with the elevated CapEx, we're getting stronger returns than we did before COVID.\nBrett Levy: If I could just follow-up on labor with one quick question. Where do you see yourselves right now in terms of where you want to be at staffing levels? And how that compares to pre-COVID staffing level? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Brett, this is Rick. I'll start with the second part. We're at about 95% of pre-COVID staffing levels, where in the end of the first quarter, we were at 90%. So we continue to increase that percentage. But I will say that, we don't - because of the productivity enhancements that we've made over the years in these brands, it means we don't need as many people as before. So a majority of our restaurants are well staffed. The exclusions that we've seen are still the most complicating factor. As exclusions for COVID, they still - the most complicating factors, especially on the weekends when we're busy. So we feel good about our staffing levels. We just want to keep trying to make sure that we get people that can work and not be excluded and continue to hire people every week and train them.\nOperator: We'll go next to David Palmer at Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Congratulations, Gene and Rick. The on-premise traffic in the US full service segment, it's down in the high 20s versus pre-COVID levels. And that's a pretty striking number. Perhaps you can comment on why you think that is? What are the biggest reasons for this at this point? Is it covered comfort levels diminished capacity out there or something else? And then focusing on Darden, how much is on-premise traffic down across your major brands versus pre-COVID levels? And I'm curious, are you really not assuming an on-premise traffic recovery in the second half of your fiscal 2023 guidance? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: David, let me just answer the first - the part about the on-premise traffic, and then I'll let Rick or Gene jump in on the other aspects of it. We are not seeing the level of decline you're talking about. We're not 20% down on on-premise. We are - when you look at on-premise overall across the system, we're probably in the single digits of decline. So that's - so I think that's different from what you're referring to the industry is, but we are - yeah, and LongHorn, actually on-premise is higher than pre-COVID. And so - and the overall Darden in the single-digits decline, but not double digits like you're alluding to.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. And I'll take the - I'll take the other part of that. As we've been making investments in our off-premise experience, making it easier for our guests to order pick up and pay, we still see people coming back more often and more often on the off-premise side. That's why we think the off-premise is going to stay at a little bit more elevated level, which could become very convenient, so maybe people won't come in as often. But we believe that in the long run, we'll get back to our pre-COVID levels of on-premise experiences as we continue to invest in our food as we continue to increase our staffing levels, as people become more confident and comfortable going out to eat. We believe that in the long run, we will get back to our in-restaurant experience.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much and congratulations, Gene and Rick. Rick, you have some big shoes to fill. I had one follow-up on the last question, and then another. The follow-up is just related to what you just mentioned about expectation to get in-restaurant dining back to full strength at a certain point. I just want to then couple that with Olive Garden and LongHorn's performance in the earlier stores that have returned to full in-store dining. Just wondering what the range of averages of that To Go businesses, I know you mentioned it's 28% and 15%. Just trying to get a sense of the range around that because it would seem like fantastic win if you could get the on-premise back to 100% and still hold on to what you suggested might be north of 20% at Olive Garden in terms of To Go. So any color you could add in terms of how much of that you think is incremental would be great.\nGene Lee: Yes. Jeff, it's Gene. As Rick alluded to earlier and stated that we believe that this off-premise is stickier than what we originally thought. And Rick gave you guys credit, you guys were right. We were wrong on that. We don't get to say that often. But it seems as though that the technology that we've created and the friction we've taken out that experience and our ability to deliver a quality experience has made this a lot stickier. And we don't know - we can keep wanting to going back to equilibrium. We haven't got to equilibrium. We're not close to equilibrium yet. So we don't know what the long-term run rate is going to be off-prem and on-prem. I mean, I would say that when we look at on-prem, there's still some regional differences based on how people think about COVID. I think when I look at on-prem, I think staffing continues to be an issue. It's getting better and better. I also think that throughput - when we look at our sales, during the week, we're a lot stronger on a comparable basis, Monday through Thursday than we are on the weekend. And we think some of that has to do with one staffing to the productivity of the people working in the restaurants, and that we believe that as they become more proficient and develop more repetitions over time that we'll actually have some more throughput through - on the weekend, where we know we have excess demand right now. We have a lot of restaurants in our system that are doing more guests in the restaurant today on-prem than they were pre-COVID. We still have pockets where we're struggling a little bit. And so I think that that's the real opportunity. As I look at the opportunities as we move forward, we've got - in full service done, we've got 11 - or overall dine-in, we got 11% less restaurants to service what we believe is going to be aggregate demand that's going to end up being as strong or greater than pre-COVID. And if we do what we've been doing all the way through this, investing in our product, investing in our people, we're going to capture our market share.\nJeffrey Bernstein: And then my follow-up just related to the comments you made about labor. It does seem like the industry is improving of late. Just wondering your thoughts on to what we should attribute that. And you had mentioned that staffing is still a big challenge for you. It seems like it's pretty much back I think you said you're now back to 95% of staffing and you don't need to get back to 100%. So I'm just wondering where is it that you have the greatest challenge from a staffing perspective, if you're that close to that full 100%, you really don't need to get back to that full 100%. Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes, Jeff, I think we - obviously, we probably struggle most in our lower-end brands where your check average isn't as high, and your business models don't afford you some of the luxuries that our other business models afford from a pay structure standpoint and you got the - basically the lower check average yield you a lower tip in aggregate. So those businesses struggle a little bit more. They also tend to be high-volume businesses, so you're running through a lot more guests through those businesses. And so, I think that, I think there's been a couple of things contributing to improved labor in the restaurant industry, obviously, getting away from the subsidies and unemployment I think people getting more confidence that they can enter back into the workforce. I think that childcare probably still the biggest barrier today for people getting back into the workforce. But I think things are better than they were 90 days ago and they were a lot in they were 180 days ago.\nOperator: We'll go next to Lauren Silberman at Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: I also wanted to ask about the wage investments. As you look across the portfolio, are you seeing greater challenges in your ability to recruit or retain employees and any differences geographically? And then how do you assess the risk that you'll need to make another big wage commitment next year?\nRick Cardenas: Lauren, this is Rick. We aren't really seeing a whole lot of differences across the country on staffing, not any more challenging in Texas as it is in New York. We're staffing our restaurants, and we're seeing the pickup. We've actually implemented a new system. As we mentioned, it's increasing our speed of hire. The one thing we've got an incredible employment proposition. When we make an offer, people accept it, and that's a great thing. And so, I think that to me, is the biggest nature. Our employment proposition is so strong that people want to come to work for us. As it relates to future need to increase our minimum kind of guaranteed wage. Right now, we're looking at - the number that we have right now at $12 is the right thing for us. As we said, and Gene mentioned, we average over $20 - around $20 an hour after this change, and we'll continue to monitor that and see where we need to increase wages on a market-by-market basis.\nLauren Silberman: Great. And just a follow-up on price covering most of what you view as structural and absorbing the short-term fluctuation. Can you expand on what you view as transitory? Is it primarily just the commodity piece or anything related to labor? Thanks. \nRick Cardenas: No. We view labor as actually more sticky. So, it really focuses on the commodities, is where we see some of the transitory, especially on the proteins front where you already see some of that coming back, right? You saw beef prices pick up, especially middle states, and they're coming - you're starting to come - you see them come down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger, UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Thank you. Gene and Rick, a big congratulations to you both. Just first question, I wanted to ask another on labor. Curious if you could speak to where labor efficiency or productivity was in the quarter? And then just regarding the pull forward of the minimum wage increase announcement, how much of that of the wage inflation target for the year that you noted is related to that pull forward?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Let me start with the second part of the question on the $12 wage. That really isn't costing us very much in the grand scheme of things. It's a very small portion of the wage inflation that we're seeing in the back half of the year. And so, I'll leave it at that. On the productivity side, we're more productive than we were - when we were two years ago. We're about as productive as we were in the first quarter versus two years ago. But I will say, remember, our second quarter is the lowest sales quarter. So productivity is a little bit more difficult to do than in Q1 and Q3.\nDennis Geiger: Appreciate that, Rick. And then just one more question, just on the consumer and recognizing some of the pandemic impacts here could make this question typical. But, sort of, what are you seeing right now across consumer demand behaviors overall consumer health, and then how you think about the consumer going into 2022. Is there anything on the lower income consumer yet that's starting to concern you? Just broader thoughts and perspective there would be great. Thank you.\nGene Lee: Yes. The consumer has never been healthier, right? I mean, you look at all the statistics out there, when you look at the personal balance sheets and where the consumer is at, I think they're learning. I think they\u2019re learning how to manage through the inflation. And I would expect - and as we transition to calendar 2022, I would expect the consumer behavior to continue to be strong. It's just that, there's a lot of talk about inflation. And inflation has been a horrible thing to the lower-end consumer. But when you really think about - if you look at the share of wallet when you think about gasoline, it's still historically low, even at current prices. And so I think people are making choices. I do believe that we're still transitioning this experiential economy, and I think people want experiences after 18 months of not having experiences. And I think going out to eat is an experience that people want to have more regularly than they've had over the past two years. And so, I feel really good about where the consumer is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.\nAndy Barish: Gene, I\u2019m just happy, it\u2019s showing in Colorado, finally. Quick question on - can you give us a little bit of a of Cheddar's, kind of, review in terms of the progress that's made here during the pandemic. And from a people side of things, which I think has been the biggest challenge, are you building bench strength to start to see a noticeable ramp in the unit growth in fiscal 2023 for that brand?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Andy, this is Rick. We're really proud of the work Chedder has done on the people front. Let me give you a couple of statistics without getting into too much detail on our P&L. They've added - they're back close to where LongHorn and Olive Garden is on the percent of their general managers that have been general managers for a year or more, where they were way far away from that a couple of years ago. Their management turnover continues to improve. I believe the last 45 restaurant general managers are managing partners that they added were all promotion within. You couldn't say that a couple of years ago. We've got a strong, strong pipeline that we're building of managers. And we do expect to have more openings in fiscal 2023 at Cheddar's than we did in - I'm sorry, in - yeah, in fiscal 2023 at Cheddar's than we had in fiscal 2022. So we're really excited where they are, partly because of the business model improvements they've made, which we don't highlight, because they're in the other segment, but they've had a significant improvement in their business model, which gives us even more confidence that they can grow with this pipeline that they're building in people.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Rutherford at Stephens.\nJames Rutherford: Thanks for the questions. Rick, marketing is still one of the biggest sources of margin expansion within your business. What main factors will you consider as you work to determine when it's time to start adding some marketing dollars back into the business incrementally?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, James, thanks for the question. As we mentioned in an earlier question, Olive Garden will always be a marketer because of their scale. The advantage that they have in their size, gives them the ability to spend money in marketing. And we'll continue to look at the time when equilibrium comes. We still have a lot of demand to come into our restaurants today. We have reduced our marketing spend overall. And as I said, as we increase - whenever we make that decision, I don't want to tell you when we would do that based on strategic implications. But whenever we would make that decision, we would ensure that that marketing is profitable, whether it's - when we compare to what we would do if we didn't have that marketing. So we have had a couple of hundred basis points of improvement in marketing spend. I would tell you that even if we increase our marketing dollars, we will still have some margin improvement or margin maintained with marketing. So don't assume that when we bring marketing back, it's going to basically reduce our margins by the amount that we bring it back.\nJames Rutherford: My second question is on LongHorn, which has clearly benefited from strong execution, as well as general robust consumer appetite for stake as a category, what do you think it will take to retain these high sales levels if and when the consumer potentially begins to shift back to more of a value-focused mindset?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Thanks for asking about LongHorn. Todd and his team have been on a journey for years. And that journey has been to invest in food quality. As we've mentioned before, we've improved all of our stakes. We've increased the size of our stakes. We've increased our portion sizes of our sides, and we've improved our execution of all of that food. And so yes, the state category has been helped by consumer demand, but we believe that we will continue to execute at this level and continue to grow LongHorn. I can't tell you what our comp will be in the future, but we're proud of what they've done over the years to continue to invest and make sure that they have the best product. They're number one in quality and casual dining, and they continue to do those things.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Mullan at Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Mullan: Thank you. I'd just like to echo all the congrats to both Gene and Rick. Just question on fine dining, specifically related to development. I know it's a smaller piece of the puzzle. But Gene, can you just talk about how you see development in this segment over the next, say, three to five years? Is there a lot more room across the country for your brands? And if you could discuss any structural changes in that segment or learning throughout pandemic might have that change your answer from what you would have said two years ago, if at all?\nGene Lee: Yes. Two parts to that answer. Number one, we think that we can push Capital Grille in suburban areas a little bit further than what maybe we have thought in the past. We've had some recent openings that give us confidence that there are additional trade areas, in which we can compete with that brand and get a great return on our investment. And then secondarily, the real opportunity is, can we take [Eddie V's] and get it to mirror Capital Grille and get to the same size company. We are thrilled with our - what we refer to as our COVID Eddie V's for the Eddie V's that we've opened during COVID. They've all gone to the market very well, and accepted very well. Our business model is really strong and getting stronger. And there's no reason why we can't get that from the high 20s into the low 60s and do that very profitably. Now again, that's a three to 40 a year. You've got to wait for the right sites, but we're just - we're thrilled. And for those who - anybody that travels to Nashville, please go visit our new Nashville Eddie V's. It's just a spectacular, spectacular venue and doing extremely well. So we're confident that Fine Dining will still continue to be a big contributor to what we're doing. And the margin structure - we just have a lot more flexibility in that business to deal with some of this inflation that we don't have in our casual brands.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning, everyone and wow Gene, what a terrific career, congrats on your decision to retire. And Rick, my congrats on your promotion. Rick, I had a question about sort of a big picture view of the long-term strategy at Darden. And I just wanted to ask with the upcoming transition to you as CEO, certainly, not much needs to change, but just wondering your thoughts on what maybe some new strategic priorities or new priorities for you as you take over the CEO role. Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: David, thanks for the question. I just want to first say that I've been with Gene for his seven years as the CEO, partnering on developing our strategy. And I really think the strategy that we have is the right strategy. We've got our four competitive advantages. We're going to continue to invest in those advantages to make them stronger. We're a platform company that helps our brands succeed and driving back to basic operating philosophy. We are going to continue to improve our operations execution and continue to invest in our competitive advantages. I don't see a big change in our strategic priorities, partly because that was a big part of writing them. So it would be a little weird if I did change those. But we'll look and see as we go through our five-year plan process, which we just did last year. So there's not a whole lot for us to talk about right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO Capital.\nAndrew Strelzik: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to first just clarify on the commodity commentary. I think you said that inflation would peak in 3Q when you called out the inflation comparison in 4Q from the year ago as part of the reason why that would ease this year. So - but you also mentioned that some of the underlying commodity prices have eased as well. So does the outlook reflect that underlying kind of easing? Or is there a timing dynamic where that's not included in that? And then my question is really on unit growth, and just at this point, the visibility to hitting the high-end of the framework that you've talked about in 2023. I know you talked about some construction cost increases and delays, which doesn't sound like that big of a deal, but just wanted to see about the visibility and anything that you can comment on the brand mix would be great. Thank you very much.\nRaj Vennam: Hi, Andrew, this is Raj. So on the commodities front, yes, we did see - the way we think about it is we're looking at what we have covered. And then based on our best estimate of where the costs are going to be, right? When you look at the cadence of some of the Q2 was around 9% commodity inflation. We expect Q3 to be a little bit north of 10%. And then I think by the time we get to Q4, because we're wrapping on elevated number two years ago or a year ago, that it's not going to be at size. So the way we are looking at it is really on a two-year basis, what does it look like? And I think if you're looking at it on a two-year basis, we're hovering around 10% to 11%, and that's where we expect Q4 to be - to land as well. And so that's why there's a big difference between Q3 and Q4. I mean, I guess at this point, on the unit growth front, we feel pretty - we still feel confident that we have a good shot at getting to the high end. There may be a few slips here and there, but we still think that 55% to 60% is a good number to think of. Obviously, a few - four or five could get pushed out. But at this point, we're still targeting that higher end.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs.\nJared Garber: Thanks and certainly, I would like to also echo my congratulations to Gene and Rick. Exciting to watch you both progressing your careers. I had two questions. One on the top-line in Olive Garden and one on cost. You noted that you're lapping over the near ending possible from two years ago. Can you help frame maybe what some of the headwinds were in that business? Obviously, the Olive Garden trends seem like they're pretty strong. But just any color on maybe what you were lapping and the headwinds that you saw related to that that would have essentially pushed that to your comp a little bit higher? And then on costs, Raj, I appreciate all the color on the commodity front. If I look at your deck, it looks like on beef, you're very, very low contracting at this point, about 25% versus the normal 80%, 80%-plus. I just wanted to get a sense of exactly how you're thinking about beef purchases and maybe some of the risks that beef prices move higher.\nRick Cardenas: Hi, Jared, it's Rick. I'll comment on the other headwinds at Olive Garden, if it's never any possible with providing not much of a comment. We don't want to talk about the impact that never any possible had. We know it was a negative impact over the years, but the profitability wasn't as high as the guests that we're doing today. And so we decided to reduce the dependency on ever any possible this year because we didn't need to drive volume into our restaurants. As we think about why we had a better performance, even lapping the earning possible, as I said, it was productivity. We just got better at serving the gas when they came in the restaurant. Our To-Go business stayed strong, which is a very productive business for us. But as we look forward, we don't know if we'll bring and when we'll bring that possible never-any back because we have a never-ending abundance every day with our never-any first course.\nGene Lee: Yes. Hi, Jared, on the coverage on beef, I think, really, the way we're thinking about it is, at this point, the forward premium is too much. And there's really - this is really purposeful. We feel like there's opportunity to be more short and not be long given where the levels are. To the extent there is risk, I mean, I think what we've shown - I think we've demonstrated over the last two quarters that if inflation ends up being higher, we'll be - our teams are agile will react, we'll adjust accordingly. But we have a pretty good line of sight into what we think the costs are going to be, and that's where we're sitting here, but could this change. Yes, but we'll adjust, and we'll still get to the commitments we made.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Ivankoe at JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Thank you very much. Since the transformative rare acquisition, that's obviously brought in Gene, the business has made a number of acquisitions with Cheddar's, Yard House, AUVs. And I did want to get a sense of maybe this is where there could be a little bit of a difference in the CEO change. In terms of appetite or potentially even need for future acquisitions, and I ask this, obviously, in the context, the organizational ability, which I'm sure you have about the organization's desire, especially as there's probably a number of businesses that are out there that you could acquire with probably not adding much G&A, if at all, based on what your scale is. But I just want to get your sense in terms of what you see in the current market, and as we kind of think about the Darden business over the next 24 months or so, if we could potentially see something else?\nRick Cardenas: John, this is Rick. I'll just start by saying, I've been involved with some of these acquisitions, but our management team and Board regularly evaluate all of our alternatives. How do we allocate capital, how do we manage our business to achieve our long-term goals? And M&A is part of that. And we'll continue to act the same way we have over the last 10 years or 15 years since we bought rare.\nGene Lee: Yes. And John, I'll just jump in and just say that, we are thrilled with our current portfolio today with the business model enhancements that we've made to these businesses. We do not need to do something to achieve our long-term framework. And we believe that, we'll - I believe, I won't - probably I won't be driving it, but I believe that we'll continue to be opportunistic if the timing is right. But at the end of the day, we love our portfolio of brands today, of market share as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro of Raymond James.\nBrian Vaccaro: Thanks and good morning. Just two quick ones, I had two quick clarifications as most of might have been asked. But on menu pricing, are you currently at around 4% today? Or are you working towards that level? And where do you expect pricing to be as we move through Q3 into Q4 for your fiscal year?\nRaj Vennam: Hi. Brian, we are not at that level. The level we're - I would say, we exited the quarter around 3-ish. And for the Q3, we expect to be in the mid-threes, and Q4 would be a little bit, north of - in the low-fourths.\nBrian Vaccaro: All right. That's helpful. And then, the Thanksgiving shift, I just wanted to confirm that, that was about 100 bps headwind to the comps versus 2019, and that should reverse in the fiscal third quarter. Is that right?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. But I would caution that Q3, again, is a high-volume quarter, so just be careful how you read into that. But yeah, it was a headwind in Q2. And it should help in Q3.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joshua Long of Piper Sandler.\nJoshua Long: Thank you for taking the questions, squeezing me in and again, echoing congratulations to everyone on their next chapters. Gene, following on some of the comments you made about the kind of COVID fatigue and the experiential nature that we're seeing in terms of consumer dining choices. Curious if you might be able to provide some context around your high-end brands, especially as we head into year-end, around some sort of return to a more normalized celebratory occasion. I imagine that's more on the social high-end dining and some of your high-end brands. But curious if you're seeing any sort of business customer return or kind of what your thoughts are or what the teams thought kind of the equilibrium there overtime would be on the high end?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think we're still experiencing the business travel at the level of pre-COVID. But we are - as you've seen from our results, we're experiencing some fairly really strong sales, I would just say - I would tell you that our holiday bookings are very strong. The demand for private dining is very strong. I would say it's smaller groups than larger groups. But overall, the demand for Fine Dining experiences, holiday celebrations is strong. And I would expect it to be strong throughout. And so, I think that business is going to be a very interesting business. As business travel returns, I think that a lot of people have really enjoyed the experiential part of Fine Dining, and it's something that we're not going to give up easily as we move forward. So, I love the business. I think we've really positioned those well, and I think they'll continue to do well.\nOperator: With no other questions holding, Mr. Kalicak, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing comments.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you. That concludes today's call. I'd like to remind you that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday, March 24, before the market opens, with the conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call, and happy holidays.\nOperator: That will conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gene Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, we had a fantastic quarter. Sales trends remained strong throughout the quarter as all our brands stayed laser-focused on creating memorable guest experiences. Despite the toughest inflationary environment we've seen in years, we achieved strong profitable sales growth. Our ongoing success navigating the pandemic is a testament to the power of our strategy driven by our back-to-basics operating philosophy and the strength of our 4 competitive advantages. Our disciplined commitment to our strategy has allowed us to manage this environment well, while returning significant cash to our shareholders. People and product will continue to be our focus and Rick will share more details about that in a minute. Additionally, our teams have done a great job managing inflation effectively, and Raj will provide more color on that during his remarks. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams as they delight our guests and help create lasting holiday memories. This time of year, is also a great reminder that being of service is at the heart of our business, which is why we're committed to serving our guests, our team members and our communities. One of the ways we serve our communities is by helping fight hunger. This fiscal year through our foundation, Darden provided $2.5 million to help our partners at Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for 15 food banks to support mobile pantry programs, and distribution in communities facing high rates of food insecurity. We are uniquely positioned to help, and by leveraging our scale and relationships with partners like Penske Truck Leasing and Lineage Logistics, we're proudly doing our part to help get food into the hands of people who need it. On behalf of our management team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our team members for everything you do to serve our guests, and our communities. And I wish you all a wonderful holiday season. Finally, earlier today, we announced that effective May 30, Rick will succeed me as Chief Executive Officer and will join Darden's Board of Directors. This is the right time for this transition, and I look forward to continuing to serve as Darden's Chairman. Our company is in a clear position of strength, and this is also the right time for me and my family. I'm excited for Rick, who's been a tremendous partner over the last seven years, and is one of the best strategic thinkers I've worked alongside. Our brands have tremendous opportunity ahead of them, and Rick is the perfect person to lead Darden into the next chapter. On behalf of the Board, Darden's management team and our 170,000 team members, I want to congratulate Rick, and wish him all the best. Rick? Chris, it's Gene. Let me just jump in here. And I think about this, the commodity infrastructure pre-COVID was able to feed the world without a lot of inflation. And that's what the world getting richer. And so, I believe that the commodity infrastructure will get back to an equilibrium where we'll be able to produce the food needed to feed everyone. And I don't think there'll be a lot of inflation in that. I think where the inflation is going to come in, in commodities is going to be whatever labor impact there is to grow and deliver that food. And so, I think we still have 12 to 18 months to - for that to all work its way out. But there was something happening over the last decade where we weren't seeing a tremendous amount of inflation in food. And I think it had to do with technology and other aspects. And I think that all that global capabilities are still there. And so, I'd just end by saying what we don't know is - what - how much labor is involved in each product to grow and deliver and harvest, and so on and so forth? And what are the impacts the labor is going to have on the commodities. And so, I think we're in a wait and see - I don't know - I mean I think the end of your question was, we're going to get COGS back to historical levels. Yes, I think over time, it will take time, but I think these models will all drift back to the same what I would call prime cost model, we add labor and COGS. Yeah. John, I think where I'd start was, we basically said, we expect our average to be approximately $20 after this goes into effect. Now very few people in our company make minimum wage. This is what I would call an entry-level wage, and more rural America. And so - in the major cities, you're not hiring anybody for $12 an hour today. This is an increase in the guarantee to our workforce, will probably have more impact on Cheddar's than any of our other brands. And so starting wages or wage rates very, very, very much depending on geography and overall demand. We have people that - in our environment that make $25 to $28 an hour in the back of the house. And in some parts of the country, you're doing that same job for $18 an hour depending on the environment. And so I don't believe - in your macro question around this casual dining paying too little, I don't think that's true. I think casual dining is paying the appropriate rates in the marketplace based on supply and demand. And I think that - I think our teams are doing a very, very good job of looking at the overall situation and ensuring that we're paying probably a little bit more of the competitive wage in each market to ensure that our restaurants are fully staffed. And we're encouraged by Rick's comments that our restaurants today are better staff than they were last quarter and they're better staff in the quarter before. And we still have strong, strong retention rates. And I think that the way we think about it - I'll leave you with this, the way we think about it is that there may not be enough service workers to staff every restaurant in America, but there's enough service workers out there to staff Darden's restaurants, and that's what we're focused on. Peter, one of the things that I think that's most interesting is machine learning for forecasting, forecasts forecasting our business is - forecasting our restaurant business is one of the most important things that we do every single day. And we think there's some real upside in the machine learning around that, and our team has developed some pretty slick stuff. And I'm fairly excited about that potential. That turns into productivity. If you can predict your business correctly, then you can really increase your productivity at the store level. Yes. Hey, Chris, yes, let me start with the latter question, first. Yes, we do. So when you look at our overall pricing, I'd say you almost you can assume that Olive Garden and Cheddar's are going to be below the Darden level of pricing and all other brands are going to be higher. Obviously, the spectrum being the fine dining will probably have the highest pricing. As far as the guest reactions, obviously, we track this over time. One of the things we noticed - one of the key factors is how much do you price relative to CPI. And I think as we look at how we have been pricing we've been pricing a lot below that. That helps - that gives us a lot more comfort in the fact that the elasticity - we're not hitting that portion of that curve that's actually more elastic. So at this point, the level of pricing we have is significantly below CPI, which means it's fairly inelastic impact. Yes. I would - that's a pretty simple answer, no. We haven't seen any change in behaviors in the regional. It's real early in this - what seems to be this next wave. I mean I think if you study the New York Times map, you could see this surge heading towards New England for a few weeks now. And so that's been a part of the country that's been most sensitive into, maybe what I would call, overreacting. So - but we'll see. I mean we - as of today, we haven't seen any big change I would just say that there's significant COVID fatigue out there, and it's going to take a lot to modify a certain percentage of the population's behavior. There's a certain percentage of the population that is going to react to this, but there's a certain set of it that's just going to continue on. All you got to do is look at stadiums and concert halls to see who those people are. Yes. Brett, it's Gene. I'll start with the fundamentals. I think the fundamentals for us right now is how do we bring along the most - the population of new employees - the percentage of the population of new employees, how do we bring them along. And as Rick said earlier, make them as productive as possible we can and bring our brands to life the way we wanted to do so. And as we head into the busiest part of the year, we're just laser focused on trying to keep things simple and ensure that we can execute at a high level. We know that our competitors are having similar - the same problems that we have, and our goal is to out-execute them and win guest loyalty through this very difficult period of time. And so I think that's really where our advantage is right now. We're better staffed. We've got - we're doing great training, and we're really confident that we're executing at a high level, and that's what our - that's what our research is telling us. Raj, you want to take the CapEx? Yes. Jeff, it's Gene. As Rick alluded to earlier and stated that we believe that this off-premise is stickier than what we originally thought. And Rick gave you guys credit, you guys were right. We were wrong on that. We don't get to say that often. But it seems as though that the technology that we've created and the friction we've taken out that experience and our ability to deliver a quality experience has made this a lot stickier. And we don't know - we can keep wanting to going back to equilibrium. We haven't got to equilibrium. We're not close to equilibrium yet. So we don't know what the long-term run rate is going to be off-prem and on-prem. I mean, I would say that when we look at on-prem, there's still some regional differences based on how people think about COVID. I think when I look at on-prem, I think staffing continues to be an issue. It's getting better and better. I also think that throughput - when we look at our sales, during the week, we're a lot stronger on a comparable basis, Monday through Thursday than we are on the weekend. And we think some of that has to do with one staffing to the productivity of the people working in the restaurants, and that we believe that as they become more proficient and develop more repetitions over time that we'll actually have some more throughput through - on the weekend, where we know we have excess demand right now. We have a lot of restaurants in our system that are doing more guests in the restaurant today on-prem than they were pre-COVID. We still have pockets where we're struggling a little bit. And so I think that that's the real opportunity. As I look at the opportunities as we move forward, we've got - in full service done, we've got 11 - or overall dine-in, we got 11% less restaurants to service what we believe is going to be aggregate demand that's going to end up being as strong or greater than pre-COVID. And if we do what we've been doing all the way through this, investing in our product, investing in our people, we're going to capture our market share. Yes, Jeff, I think we - obviously, we probably struggle most in our lower-end brands where your check average isn't as high, and your business models don't afford you some of the luxuries that our other business models afford from a pay structure standpoint and you got the - basically the lower check average yield you a lower tip in aggregate. So those businesses struggle a little bit more. They also tend to be high-volume businesses, so you're running through a lot more guests through those businesses. And so, I think that, I think there's been a couple of things contributing to improved labor in the restaurant industry, obviously, getting away from the subsidies and unemployment I think people getting more confidence that they can enter back into the workforce. I think that childcare probably still the biggest barrier today for people getting back into the workforce. But I think things are better than they were 90 days ago and they were a lot in they were 180 days ago. Yes. The consumer has never been healthier, right? I mean, you look at all the statistics out there, when you look at the personal balance sheets and where the consumer is at, I think they're learning. I think they're learning how to manage through the inflation. And I would expect - and as we transition to calendar 2022, I would expect the consumer behavior to continue to be strong. It's just that, there's a lot of talk about inflation. And inflation has been a horrible thing to the lower-end consumer. But when you really think about - if you look at the share of wallet when you think about gasoline, it's still historically low, even at current prices. And so I think people are making choices. I do believe that we're still transitioning this experiential economy, and I think people want experiences after 18 months of not having experiences. And I think going out to eat is an experience that people want to have more regularly than they've had over the past two years. And so, I feel really good about where the consumer is. Yes. Two parts to that answer. Number one, we think that we can push Capital Grille in suburban areas a little bit further than what maybe we have thought in the past. We've had some recent openings that give us confidence that there are additional trade areas, in which we can compete with that brand and get a great return on our investment. And then secondarily, the real opportunity is, can we take [Eddie V's] and get it to mirror Capital Grille and get to the same size company. We are thrilled with our - what we refer to as our COVID Eddie V's for the Eddie V's that we've opened during COVID. They've all gone to the market very well, and accepted very well. Our business model is really strong and getting stronger. And there's no reason why we can't get that from the high 20s into the low 60s and do that very profitably. Now again, that's a three to 40 a year. You've got to wait for the right sites, but we're just - we're thrilled. And for those who - anybody that travels to Nashville, please go visit our new Nashville Eddie V's. It's just a spectacular, spectacular venue and doing extremely well. So we're confident that Fine Dining will still continue to be a big contributor to what we're doing. And the margin structure - we just have a lot more flexibility in that business to deal with some of this inflation that we don't have in our casual brands. Yes. Hi, Jared, on the coverage on beef, I think, really, the way we're thinking about it is, at this point, the forward premium is too much. And there's really - this is really purposeful. We feel like there's opportunity to be more short and not be long given where the levels are. To the extent there is risk, I mean, I think what we've shown - I think we've demonstrated over the last two quarters that if inflation ends up being higher, we'll be - our teams are agile will react, we'll adjust accordingly. But we have a pretty good line of sight into what we think the costs are going to be, and that's where we're sitting here, but could this change. Yes, but we'll adjust, and we'll still get to the commitments we made. Yes. And John, I'll just jump in and just say that, we are thrilled with our current portfolio today with the business model enhancements that we've made to these businesses. We do not need to do something to achieve our long-term framework. And we believe that, we'll - I believe, I won't - probably I won't be driving it, but I believe that we'll continue to be opportunistic if the timing is right. But at the end of the day, we love our portfolio of brands today, of market share as we move forward. Yes. I think we're still experiencing the business travel at the level of pre-COVID. But we are - as you've seen from our results, we're experiencing some fairly really strong sales, I would just say - I would tell you that our holiday bookings are very strong. The demand for private dining is very strong. I would say it's smaller groups than larger groups. But overall, the demand for Fine Dining experiences, holiday celebrations is strong. And I would expect it to be strong throughout. And so, I think that business is going to be a very interesting business. As business travel returns, I think that a lot of people have really enjoyed the experiential part of Fine Dining, and it's something that we're not going to give up easily as we move forward. So, I love the business. I think we've really positioned those well, and I think they'll continue to do well."

            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, 37% higher than last year, driven by 34.4% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. Average weekly sales grew by more than 7% compared to pre-COVID. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.48. Total EBITDA was $335 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 14.7%. The significant business model improvements we made over the past year and half, combined with strong sales, resulted in margin growth of 270 basis points compared to pre-COVID. We expect this to be the highest quarterly EBITDA margin growth this fiscal year as this quarter has the most opportunity given its low seasonality. We continue to return significant cash to shareholders, paying $143 million in dividends and repurchasing $266 million in shares, totaling over $400 million of cash returned to investors in the quarter. And while we're happy with our performance, cost pressures continue to exceed our expectations on both commodities and labor with total inflation of 6% this quarter. Our teams continue to demonstrate agility in managing through this environment. This quarter, we implemented several mitigating actions to preserve the strength of our business model while balancing the impact to our guests and team members. One of these actions was taking additional pricing. For the second quarter, total pricing was 2%, and we expect back half pricing to approach 4%, resulting in total pricing of just under 3% for the full fiscal year. We continue to execute our strategy of pricing significantly below our overall inflation to strengthen our value leadership position by leveraging our scale. This level of pricing covers most of what we consider to be the structural and long-lasting impacts of the current inflationary environment, and absorbing what we consider to be more short-term fluctuations, while providing future flexibility should there be a need. For the rest of the fiscal year, we expect commodity and labor inflation to peak in our third quarter and then start to slow down as we enter the fourth quarter, and lap commodities inflation of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. Now turning to our P&L and segment performance for the second quarter. We're comparing against pre-COVID results in the second quarter of 2020, which we believe are more comparable to normal business operations, and with how we've been framing our margin expansion opportunity. For the second quarter, food and beverage expenses were 220 basis points higher, driven by elevated commodity inflation of 9% as well as investments in food quality, portion size and pricing significantly below inflation. Restaurant labor was 90 basis points favorable, driven by sales leverage and efficiencies gained from operational simplifications, and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures. Hourly wage inflation during the quarter was almost 9%. Restaurant expenses were 130 basis points lower due to sales leverage, which more than offset higher utilities costs. Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 230 basis points of favorability. As a result, restaurant-level EBITDA margin for Darden was 18.8%, 230 basis points better than pre-COVID levels. G&A expense was 40 basis points lower, driven by savings from the corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021, a decrease in mark-to-market expense and sales leverage. Turning to our segment performance. Second quarter sales at Olive Garden increased 5% versus pre-COVID, strong performance, especially as we were wrapping against nine weeks of never-ending possible. This sales growth, combined with the business model improvements at Olive Garden, helped drive a segment profit margin increase of 320 basis points, even while offsetting elevated inflation. LongHorn continued its strong sales growth with an increase of 22% versus pre-COVID. However, inflationary pressures, including double-digits for commodities, were at their highest level in the second quarter, resulting in reduction of segment profit margin by 80 basis points. Sales at our Fine Dining segment increased 22% versus pre-COVID, as this segment continues to see a strong rebound in performance. Segment profit margin grew by 140 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodities inflation. Our other segment grew sales by 7% versus pre-COVID and segment profit margin by 250 basis points. This segment continues to perform well, and we're pleased to see the business model transformation persist. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022. We updated our outlook for the full-year to reflect our performance year-to-date and our expected performance for the remainder of the year. We now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11% from pre-COVID levels. Same-restaurant sales growth of 29% to 31%, and 35% to 40% new restaurants. Capital spending of approximately $425 million. Total inflation of approximately 5.5%, with commodities inflation between 7% and 8%. Total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation approaching 9%. EBITDA of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion, and the annual effective tax rate of approximately 14%, and approximately 130 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.35 and $7.60. This outlook implies EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID, similar to our previous outlook of 200 to 250 basis points with flow-through from pricing and higher sales, helping offset elevated inflation. Now we'll take your questions. Yes. Hi, Brian, this is Raj. I think as you alluded to, we have - we committed to the 200 to 250 at the beginning of the year, and we've shown through the two quarters now that we're adjusting our business model, adjusting our thinking on pricing based on where our business model is coming out. So as we look at our P&L, we continue to look at opportunities to manage costs better. And we are focused on doing some of that before we take pricing. But with that said, we preserved a lot of flexibility, and we have - and we are tapping into some of that. But we do believe we have more dry powder if needed. And I think the way we're thinking about it is really some of these excess sales are going to help offset some of this elevated inflation. The other piece I mentioned in my prepared remarks was that we're really focused on pricing to cover for the structural parts of it, and then trying to kind of weather through the short-term fluctuations. And - but we are committed to the margin growth. Yes. Eric, I think when you think about Q3, it's historically has been a strong seasonal quarter, right? From - the volumes are higher. Our margins are really high. I mean if you go back to pre-COVID, I think we were in the 15-plus range for the third quarter when our annual was around 14%. So the point I think we're trying to make here is that, once you start approaching that 17-plus percent, it starts to get harder-and-harder. So that's really what we're trying to talk about is that, there was a lot more opportunity in Q2, because you're able to leverage that low volume period some of the fixed costs better, and it just gets harder-and-harder when you're at the high volume. The staffing is higher. We do staff - we want to staff - over staff, especially during peak periods, during the holidays, so that's part of that. But overall, 17-plus is - starts to get harder. Yes. Look, clearly, in this environment with inflation, there are construction costs on the CapEx that are going up a little bit. But overall, CapEx levels given - while they are higher related - what we said was the high end of the guidance we had provided earlier, the efficiency of this capital spend is still very high. We're actually still - especially with the improvements we made at the unit level, the returns are really strong. So even with the elevated CapEx, we're getting stronger returns than we did before COVID. David, let me just answer the first - the part about the on-premise traffic, and then I'll let Rick or Gene jump in on the other aspects of it. We are not seeing the level of decline you're talking about. We're not 20% down on on-premise. We are - when you look at on-premise overall across the system, we're probably in the single digits of decline. So that's - so I think that's different from what you're referring to the industry is, but we are - yeah, and LongHorn, actually on-premise is higher than pre-COVID. And so - and the overall Darden in the single-digits decline, but not double digits like you're alluding to. Hi, Andrew, this is Raj. So on the commodities front, yes, we did see - the way we think about it is we're looking at what we have covered. And then based on our best estimate of where the costs are going to be, right? When you look at the cadence of some of the Q2 was around 9% commodity inflation. We expect Q3 to be a little bit north of 10%. And then I think by the time we get to Q4, because we're wrapping on elevated number two years ago or a year ago, that it's not going to be at size. So the way we are looking at it is really on a two-year basis, what does it look like? And I think if you're looking at it on a two-year basis, we're hovering around 10% to 11%, and that's where we expect Q4 to be - to land as well. And so that's why there's a big difference between Q3 and Q4. I mean, I guess at this point, on the unit growth front, we feel pretty - we still feel confident that we have a good shot at getting to the high end. There may be a few slips here and there, but we still think that 55% to 60% is a good number to think of. Obviously, a few - four or five could get pushed out. But at this point, we're still targeting that higher end. Hi. Brian, we are not at that level. The level we're - I would say, we exited the quarter around 3-ish. And for the Q3, we expect to be in the mid-threes, and Q4 would be a little bit, north of - in the low-fourths. Yes. But I would caution that Q3, again, is a high-volume quarter, so just be careful how you read into that. But yeah, it was a headwind in Q2. And it should help in Q3."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene. Good morning, everyone. It is an honor to be appointed Darden's next Chief Executive Officer, and I'm grateful to Gene and the Board for their confidence in me. It is humbling to lead 170,000 outstanding team members who nourish and delight everyone we serve. I was incredibly fortunate to work with each of Darden's CEOs, so I have a strong appreciation for the legacy of leadership I am inheriting. By upholding our commitment to operational excellence, and maximizing the power of the Darden platform, we will continue to execute our strategy to drive growth and shareholder value. Turning to the quarter. Our restaurants continue to execute at a high level. Our focus on simplifying operations to drive execution remains our top priority, which is why we once again paused any new initiatives during the quarter in order to eliminate distractions and allow our operators to focus on running great shifts. This pause also ensures they can zero in on people and product, as we navigate through the current staffing and supply chain challenges. From a people perspective, we feel good about the progress we've made on the staffing front. Across our brands, manager staffing levels are above historical norms, and team member staffing levels continue to improve. Our new hiring system has made it easier to source talent, giving our management teams more time to focus on successfully onboarding and training new team members. We also continue to invest in our team members, further strengthening our industry-leading employment proposition. Earlier this year, we committed to increasing the minimum hourly earnings for our restaurant team members to $12, which includes income earned through gratuities by January 2023. However, given the strength of our performance, we are accelerating that timing to January 2022. This primarily impacts entry-level roles such as hosts, busters and dishwashers. And with this change, we expect our restaurant team members will earn, on average, approximately $20 per hour. Our people are the key to our performance. We work hard to be the employer of choice in our industry, and we're proud that our retention rates for managers and team members are both in the top quartile, and we will continue to invest in them to retain and attract the best talent in the industry. On the product side, our supply chain team continues to do a great job, making sure our restaurants have the products they need to serve our guests. Our inventory levels are strong, and the team's ability to meet the needs of the business can be seen in the fact that we shipped more cases in the last two quarters than at any time during Darden's history. The ability to maintain supply continuity for our restaurants minimizes distractions and allows our operators to focus on executing at the highest level, whether our guests are in our dining rooms or enjoying the convenience of To Go. During the quarter, To Go sales continued to benefit from the strength of our digital platform. This platform not only makes it easier for our teams to execute, it makes it more convenient for our guests to visit, order, pay and pick up. Off-premise sales accounted for 28% of total sales at Olive Garden and 15% of total sales at LongHorn Steakhouse. Digital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales during this quarter and 11% of Darden's total sales. Finally, we successfully opened 12 new restaurants during the quarter, including a flagship Yard House in Times Square, with minimal staffing challenges. The time to build a new restaurant is longer today than it has been historically, and we are also beginning to see longer lead times for kitchen equipment and technology hardware. Regardless, we remain on track to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year. To wrap up, I also want to recognize our team members in our restaurants and our support center, for your tireless efforts in creating exceptional experiences for our guests. I wish you all a safe and happy holiday season. Now I'll turn it over to Raj. Andrew, this is Rick. First of all, I just want to say how proud I am of the work that Dan and his team has done, keeping with our strategy. We did have trends improved in Q2, and we exceeded industry 2 year comp growth. So thanks for noticing that. I think one of the things that we've been thinking about through marketing spend is we're going to continue to look for equilibrium and react accordingly to whatever happens in the marketplace. Advertising will always be a part of Darden's mix because of the scale advantage they have. And if and when we increase our marketing spend we'd expect it to earn a return compared to where we were if we didn't have any marketing spend. So we're going to continue to see what happens. We don't - we know that there's some advertisers out there with some heavy TRPs. We had $44 million less in media this quarter than we did two years ago. And we feel good about where we were. Andrew, yes, you mentioned our To Go sales at Olive Garden were a little bit higher than they were in Q1. We had a - this is a typically lower volume quarter for us and the To Go sales stayed up there. So that helped our total percentage. To answer your question about what we expect it to be, we do expect it to be higher than our 20% that we said. It is a little bit stickier than we thought. You guys were all right about that, a little stickier than we thought. We're not going to necessarily say, we should expect to be at 25%, but probably above 20%. Yes, Eric. Yes, we saw the same increase in November that the industry did. And as I said, Olive Garden was ahead of the industry, and so with LongHorn. What I would say is it's too early to tell if it was a pull forward from shopping. We do know that retail sales were a little bit more online this year than a normal kind of after Thanksgiving, and some of the retailers were closed on Thanksgiving Day. But it's too early to tell about that. We do have a shift, as we've said before, that Thanksgiving shifted back into our second quarter from our third quarter two years ago, and we're seeing that kind of impact this quarter. So still too early to tell, but the holidays do lineup pretty well for us. I will caveat all that by saying weather is the biggest fluctuation in this quarter, and we'll see what happens. If weather hits during a holiday period, then that could be a little bit of a challenge on the comp. Sorry about that, guys. Sorry. Chris thanks a lot for the question. This is Rick. As a reminder, the second quarter is our lowest seasonal quarter. We did run NAPB two years ago. So, we're really proud of the fact that we comped over two years ago without never any possible running. And this was really aided by the point you made up in staffing, aided by productivity enhancements we made during the quarter, and the fact that our two - new team members were moving up the learning curve more quickly and becoming more productive. And there could be something about vaccination rates being above Q1 levels, so maybe people are more comfortable dining out. And the fact that we have, as you mentioned, made these investments in our core items. They are: we've made great investments in the items that people really want. The value ratings are great, and we're just executing at a high level. I think about a couple of things that are not directly related to training and staffing. So those initiatives, we're still working on making sure that we've got our restaurants staffed and we've got our restaurants staffed and we've got our people trained. But things like new product development, that for years, we've done a lot of new development, but we're focusing on just developing one or two products a year that are really great. And so we thought it was right for us to not go ahead and do that during this time when we can keep managers focused entirely on staffing their restaurant, making sure they train their people. So that's an example. We're still doing a lot of things here in the support center that are getting ready to gear up, a lot on the technology front, but that was one example. Yes, this is Rick. We're talking weeks, not months, a couple of weeks here or there. We may have a restaurant or two that might go a little bit longer than that, but on average, we're a few weeks. And we are starting to order a lot of these long lead time items a lot sooner, and actually holding them in inventory, which not driving our inventory costs up, but making sure that we have the kitchen equipment to open the restaurant when the restaurant is ready to open. So not very long. Yes, Peter. We've always focused on our technology in three places, and I'll talk about the two big ones, guest-facing and restaurant technology. So if you think about what we're doing on the restaurant side. We are doing a lot of things to help improve productivity, simplifying processes for managers so that they don't have to hunt and pack and do other things so that they can spend their time training their people. But we don't foresee bringing in technology that will reduce the number of people that we need to do the job. We are a full-service restaurant company, and we're going to maintain that to provide the service that our guests expect. We will bring technology into help that, but not to necessarily replace. Yes. Brett, this is Rick. I'll start with the second part. We're at about 95% of pre-COVID staffing levels, where in the end of the first quarter, we were at 90%. So we continue to increase that percentage. But I will say that, we don't - because of the productivity enhancements that we've made over the years in these brands, it means we don't need as many people as before. So a majority of our restaurants are well staffed. The exclusions that we've seen are still the most complicating factor. As exclusions for COVID, they still - the most complicating factors, especially on the weekends when we're busy. So we feel good about our staffing levels. We just want to keep trying to make sure that we get people that can work and not be excluded and continue to hire people every week and train them. Yes. And I'll take the - I'll take the other part of that. As we've been making investments in our off-premise experience, making it easier for our guests to order pick up and pay, we still see people coming back more often and more often on the off-premise side. That's why we think the off-premise is going to stay at a little bit more elevated level, which could become very convenient, so maybe people won't come in as often. But we believe that in the long run, we'll get back to our pre-COVID levels of on-premise experiences as we continue to invest in our food as we continue to increase our staffing levels, as people become more confident and comfortable going out to eat. We believe that in the long run, we will get back to our in-restaurant experience. Lauren, this is Rick. We aren't really seeing a whole lot of differences across the country on staffing, not any more challenging in Texas as it is in New York. We're staffing our restaurants, and we're seeing the pickup. We've actually implemented a new system. As we mentioned, it's increasing our speed of hire. The one thing we've got an incredible employment proposition. When we make an offer, people accept it, and that's a great thing. And so, I think that to me, is the biggest nature. Our employment proposition is so strong that people want to come to work for us. As it relates to future need to increase our minimum kind of guaranteed wage. Right now, we're looking at - the number that we have right now at $12 is the right thing for us. As we said, and Gene mentioned, we average over $20 - around $20 an hour after this change, and we'll continue to monitor that and see where we need to increase wages on a market-by-market basis. No. We view labor as actually more sticky. So, it really focuses on the commodities, is where we see some of the transitory, especially on the proteins front where you already see some of that coming back, right? You saw beef prices pick up, especially middle states, and they're coming - you're starting to come - you see them come down. Yes. Let me start with the second part of the question on the $12 wage. That really isn't costing us very much in the grand scheme of things. It's a very small portion of the wage inflation that we're seeing in the back half of the year. And so, I'll leave it at that. On the productivity side, we're more productive than we were - when we were two years ago. We're about as productive as we were in the first quarter versus two years ago. But I will say, remember, our second quarter is the lowest sales quarter. So productivity is a little bit more difficult to do than in Q1 and Q3. Yes, Andy, this is Rick. We're really proud of the work Chedder has done on the people front. Let me give you a couple of statistics without getting into too much detail on our P&L. They've added - they're back close to where LongHorn and Olive Garden is on the percent of their general managers that have been general managers for a year or more, where they were way far away from that a couple of years ago. Their management turnover continues to improve. I believe the last 45 restaurant general managers are managing partners that they added were all promotion within. You couldn't say that a couple of years ago. We've got a strong, strong pipeline that we're building of managers. And we do expect to have more openings in fiscal 2023 at Cheddar's than we did in - I'm sorry, in - yeah, in fiscal 2023 at Cheddar's than we had in fiscal 2022. So we're really excited where they are, partly because of the business model improvements they've made, which we don't highlight, because they're in the other segment, but they've had a significant improvement in their business model, which gives us even more confidence that they can grow with this pipeline that they're building in people. Yes, James, thanks for the question. As we mentioned in an earlier question, Olive Garden will always be a marketer because of their scale. The advantage that they have in their size, gives them the ability to spend money in marketing. And we'll continue to look at the time when equilibrium comes. We still have a lot of demand to come into our restaurants today. We have reduced our marketing spend overall. And as I said, as we increase - whenever we make that decision, I don't want to tell you when we would do that based on strategic implications. But whenever we would make that decision, we would ensure that that marketing is profitable, whether it's - when we compare to what we would do if we didn't have that marketing. So we have had a couple of hundred basis points of improvement in marketing spend. I would tell you that even if we increase our marketing dollars, we will still have some margin improvement or margin maintained with marketing. So don't assume that when we bring marketing back, it's going to basically reduce our margins by the amount that we bring it back. Yes. Thanks for asking about LongHorn. Todd and his team have been on a journey for years. And that journey has been to invest in food quality. As we've mentioned before, we've improved all of our stakes. We've increased the size of our stakes. We've increased our portion sizes of our sides, and we've improved our execution of all of that food. And so yes, the state category has been helped by consumer demand, but we believe that we will continue to execute at this level and continue to grow LongHorn. I can't tell you what our comp will be in the future, but we're proud of what they've done over the years to continue to invest and make sure that they have the best product. They're number one in quality and casual dining, and they continue to do those things. David, thanks for the question. I just want to first say that I've been with Gene for his seven years as the CEO, partnering on developing our strategy. And I really think the strategy that we have is the right strategy. We've got our four competitive advantages. We're going to continue to invest in those advantages to make them stronger. We're a platform company that helps our brands succeed and driving back to basic operating philosophy. We are going to continue to improve our operations execution and continue to invest in our competitive advantages. I don't see a big change in our strategic priorities, partly because that was a big part of writing them. So it would be a little weird if I did change those. But we'll look and see as we go through our five-year plan process, which we just did last year. So there's not a whole lot for us to talk about right now. Hi, Jared, it's Rick. I'll comment on the other headwinds at Olive Garden, if it's never any possible with providing not much of a comment. We don't want to talk about the impact that never any possible had. We know it was a negative impact over the years, but the profitability wasn't as high as the guests that we're doing today. And so we decided to reduce the dependency on ever any possible this year because we didn't need to drive volume into our restaurants. As we think about why we had a better performance, even lapping the earning possible, as I said, it was productivity. We just got better at serving the gas when they came in the restaurant. Our To-Go business stayed strong, which is a very productive business for us. But as we look forward, we don't know if we'll bring and when we'll bring that possible never-any back because we have a never-ending abundance every day with our never-any first course. John, this is Rick. I'll just start by saying, I've been involved with some of these acquisitions, but our management team and Board regularly evaluate all of our alternatives. How do we allocate capital, how do we manage our business to achieve our long-term goals? And M&A is part of that. And we'll continue to act the same way we have over the last 10 years or 15 years since we bought rare."

Our ability to drive profitable sales growth is a testament to the strength of our business model and our continued adherence to the strategy we implemented 6 years ago. Our brands remain laser focused on executing our back to basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere, while at the Darden level, we concentrate on strengthening and leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Our first quarter sales trends started strong as momentum carried over from the fourth quarter and they further strengthened and peaked in July. However, in August, sales slowed due to the impact of the Delta variant, but remained positive relative to pre-COVID levels. For the first quarter, sales per operating week were up 4.8% relative to pre-COVID. And through the first 3 weeks in September, sales per operating week were up approximately 7% relative to pre-COVID. Regardless of the operating environment, our unwavering commitment to our strategy ensures we will stay focused on what we do best, providing exceptional guest experiences. Throughout this unique period, our operators have shown tremendous flexibility while remaining locked in on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. At the same time, our focus helps us continue to find ways to make our competitive advantages work even harder for us. One of the ways we do this is by leveraging our ability to open value-creating new restaurants. We opened 7 new restaurants during the quarter, all of which are exceeding our expectations. And we remain on track to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year. Our long-term framework calls for 2% to 3% sales growth from new restaurants. Given our stronger unit economics, our development team is working hard to build out a pipeline of locations for fiscal \u201823 and beyond that would put us at or above the higher end of our framework. Before I turn it over to Rick, I want to thank our team members in our restaurants and our support center. As I visit our restaurants and talk with our teams, I am constantly reminded why our people are our greatest competitive advantage. Their passion for being of service to our guests and each other fuels our success. Rick?\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. Our success this quarter was driven by the work we have done to simplify our processes and our menus to drive execution at the highest level. We also paused any new initiatives in order to further eliminate distractions for our restaurant teams and allow them to focus on what it takes to run 14 great shifts a week. In addition, To Go sales continue to benefit from the ongoing evolution of our digital platform. This platform makes it simpler for our guests to visit, order, pay and pickup, all while making it easier for our teams to execute at the highest level, both in the dining room and off-premise. This served our teams well as To Go sales remained high through the quarter. For the quarter, off-premise sales accounted for 27% of total sales at Olive Garden and 15% of total sales at LongHorn Steakhouse. Digital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and guest satisfaction metrics for off-premise experiences remains strong. As we navigate short-term external pressures, our focus is simple. We must continue to win when it comes to our people and product. From a people perspective, the employment environment is challenging. That\u2019s why our top priority during the quarter was staffing our restaurants. Our operators and HR teams have done a great job sourcing talent. We recently launched a new talent acquisition system that helps increase our pool of candidates by allowing applicants to apply and schedule an interview in 5 minutes or less. Additionally, our brands are successfully utilizing their digital platforms, including social media, to promote our employment proposition and drive applications. As a result, we are netting more than 1,000 new team members per week and our team member count is approximately 90% of our pre-COVID levels. The biggest operational challenge we have been dealing with is the temporary exclusion of team members identified through contact tracing. Given our commitment to health and safety, we are diligent about exclusions, but they create sudden staffing disruptions for our operators. Despite being appropriately staffed in the majority of our restaurants, these exclusions reduced the number of available team members with little notice for our operators to prepare. This volatility can negatively impact sales in these restaurants for the duration of the exclusion period. Getting and staying staffed also requires a strong focus on training. As we continue to hire, it is critical that we have the right training in place to ensure we continue to execute at a high level. That\u2019s why our operations leaders are validating the quality of our training during their restaurant visits, ensuring new team members receive the appropriate amount of training and successfully complete the required assessments. Our team members are the heart and soul of our business and we are constantly focused on our employment proposition. The investments we have made and continue to make in our people are helping us retain and attract top talent and I am confident in our ability to address our staffing needs. When it comes to product, our significant scale, including our dedicated distribution capabilities, enables us to manage through the challenges affecting the global supply chain and maintain continuity for our restaurants. Our supply chain team continues to work hard to ensure we successfully manage through any spot outages we encounter and our restaurants have the key products they need to serve our guests. During the quarter, we had to secure more product than usual on the spot market, because our brands exceeded sales expectations and some of our suppliers experienced capacity challenges. Raj will share more details in a moment, but these higher sales volumes as well as freight costs have contributed to higher than expected inflation. Our scale advantage provides the opportunity for us to price below our competition and inflation, which is a strategy we have executed successfully. Our competitive advantage of extensive data and insights allows us to be surgical in our pricing approach positioning us well to deal with these higher costs and maintain our value leadership. The rich insights we gather from our analytics help us find the right opportunities to price in ways that minimize impact to traffic over time. We still expect pricing to be well below the rate of inflation for the year, further strengthening our value proposition. Ensuring our restaurants are appropriately staffed and our supply chain continues to avoid significant disruptions will be the most important factors of our continued success in the short-term. To wrap up, I also want to recognize our outstanding team. I am inspired by the dedication and winning spirit that our leaders and team members both in our restaurants and in our support center continue to demonstrate. Thanks to each of you for all that you do to continue to create exceptional experiences for our guests. Now, I will turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, 51% higher than last year, driven by 47.5% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.76. We returned approximately $330 million to our shareholders this quarter, paying $144 million in dividends and repurchasing $186 million in shares. We had strong performance this quarter despite increased inflationary pressures, with EBITDA of $370 million and EBITDA margin of 16%, 250 basis points higher than pre-COVID. Our sales results were better than expected, requiring us to go out and purchase more product, on the spot market. In particular, proteins, as our LongHorn and Fine Dining segments had the largest sales outperformance versus our expectations. The market for proteins this quarter was very strong with spot premiums as high as 30% above our contracted rates. This resulted in higher average cost per pound for our proteins, contributing to total commodities inflation for the quarter of approximately 5.5%. Given the heightened attention on inflation, I want to clarify that we use a conventional approach to calculating the rate of inflation. We are only measuring change in average price, holding product mix and usage constant. We follow the same approach for calculating wage inflation rate in which we keep the hours and job mix constant and only look at change in wage. While we expect higher rates of inflation to persist for the remainder of the year versus what we initially planned, we believe our scale and recent enhancements to our business model enable us to deliver significant margin expansion, while still adhering to our strategy of pricing below inflation. Now, looking at the P&L for the first quarter of 2022, we are providing a comparison against pre-COVID results in the first quarter of 2020 which we believe is a more comparable to normal business operations and with how we have been talking about our margin expansion. For the first quarter, food and beverage expenses were 150 basis points higher driven by investments in both food quality and pricing significantly below inflation. Restaurant labor was 110 basis points lower, driven primarily by hourly labor improvement due to efficiencies gained from operational simplifications and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures. Restaurant expenses were also 110 basis points lower due to sales leverage. Marketing spend was $45 million lower, resulting in 220 basis points of favorability. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin for Darden was 20.9%, 290 basis points better than pre-COVID levels. G&A expense was 30 basis points higher, driven primarily by approximately $10 million of stock compensation expenses related to the immediate expensing of equity awards for retirement-eligible employees. Additionally, we had approximately $5 million of expense related to mark-to-market on our deferred compensation. As a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, it\u2019s largely offset on the tax line. These impacts were partially offset by savings from corporate restructuring implemented in fiscal 2021. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.6%, which benefited from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate would have been closer to the top end of our guidance range for the year. Turning to our segment performance, first quarter sales at Olive Garden were flat to pre-COVID, while segment profit margin increased 220 basis points. This was strong performance despite elevated inflation and 2-year check growth of only 2.4%. LongHorn had the best sales performance across our segments with sales increasing by 26% versus pre-COVID, while growing segment profit margin by 250 basis points. Sales at our Fine Dining segment increased 24% versus pre-COVID in what\u2019s traditionally their slowest quarter from a seasonal perspective. Segment profit margin grew by 490 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodity inflation. Our other segment grew sales by nearly 5% and segment profit margin by 360 basis points. We continue to be excited about the long-term prospects of this segment as it\u2019s driving the strongest underlying business model improvement of all our segments. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022, based on our performance this quarter and expected performance for the remainder of the year, we increased our outlook for the full year. We now expect total sales of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, representing growth of 7% to 9% from pre-COVID levels; same restaurant sales growth of 27% to 30% and 35 to 40 new restaurants; capital spending of $375 million to $425 million; total inflation of approximately 4% with commodities inflation of 4.5% and total restaurant labor inflation of 5.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation of about 7%; EBITDA of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion; an annual effective tax rate of 13% to 14%; and approximately 131 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.25 and $7.60. This outlook implies EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID in line with our previous outlook as higher sales are helping offset elevated inflation. Before we open it up for questions, I want to remind you about a calendar shift next quarter. Thanksgiving falls in our fiscal second quarter this year, whereas it was in the fiscal third quarter pre-COVID. This will be a net negative to second quarter from its sales perspective. Now, we will take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks. Good morning. Gene or whoever, could you please first just talk about the impact of the reduction of couponing at Olive Garden? I think that probably has adversely impacted sales. It obviously has a huge positive impact on margin. But can you just sort of quantify what you think the foregone sales were for that so as we think about that brand versus peers, we have the right context?\nGene Lee: Yes. Let me take a stab at this a little broader, John and just the coupons, because I am not sure we can get right to the number that you are looking for. I mean I think the coupon number probably was about 1% of sales. And so trying to say, okay, what\u2019s that driving guest count? I think that\u2019s a little bit harder to get at. When I look at that line in the P&L, it\u2019s about \u2013 it was about 1%. Let me just put Olive Garden\u2019s performance in context for everybody. Obviously, I am thrilled with their performance. We only have 2.5% check in the business over the last 2 years. That\u2019s compared to a little over 5% for the industry. I mean, that\u2019s a strategic choice that we continue to make and we think it\u2019s the right choice. And if you just assume that the marketing was breakeven, I mean, you got to add another 10 points to the sales. And so basically, they are flat, flattish and you take out that marketing, that\u2019s a big number. The other thing and then Rick alluded to this in his script I mean we are still struggling from a staffing standpoint, primarily because of the exclusions. And if you think about that, that\u2019s limiting our sales. And it\u2019s just \u2013 and the way I think about it, it\u2019s just another way of capacity limitation. Just if you just think about it, on average, I guess we have one or two sections closed in most of our restaurants, most nights. So we are losing 6 to 8 tables. So there is, especially in Olive Garden, that\u2019s putting a cap on what we can do for sales. So, when I think about the overall and I sum up Olive Garden\u2019s performance, I just think that we are doing unbelievable. We have got 23.2% restaurant level earnings percentage. Our profit grew $25 million over pre-COVID. This is just \u2013 this is an impressive business. And we are just \u2013 we are reevaluating over time how we are going to take this business to market when we think about couponing, when we think about overall promotional activity and full marketing.\nJohn Glass: Thank you for that. And if I can just ask one follow-up, Raj, on your commodity comments, it sounds like you would still expect maybe better commodity inflation later in the year. Do you have better visibility than you did before? I mean what would prevent you from having to go to the spot market more often if sales continue to go? How much visibility do you have on that inflation for the full year now versus last quarter?\nRaj Vennam: Sure, John. Let me start by saying we have \u2013 you saw us we increased our forecast for sales. So, that gives us a little bit of, I guess, less need to have to go back into the market than what we are already anticipating. So, some of that increased sales impact is baked into our estimate. As we look at Q2 and Q3, we have more visibility clearly into \u2013 a lot more into Q2 and some decent visibility into Q3. Q4 is one that\u2019s probably we will have to figure out where things shake out, but we do \u2013 we did have higher inflation last year in Q4. But all-in-all, the way we are thinking about it is, Q1, we had about 5.5%. We have about 80% contracted for Q2 based on the updated volume. And then for Q3, I think we have around 60% contracted out. So, we feel pretty good about that. Could there be some movement? Absolutely. But I think that\u2019s where we showed you, I think, in the first quarter how we have the ability to manage through that. I mean, I think the fact I mentioned about the business model improvements as well as other levers we have at our disposable \u2013 at our disposal to help us manage through that fairly well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Rick, I appreciate the commentary on the labor and staffing challenges. What have you seen over the last 2 weeks since that $300 a week [supplemental] (ph) unemployment insurance expired. Has this been as large of a tailwind as you previously anticipated and perhaps you can speak to what you are seeing in state that curtailed benefits earlier this summer as a leading indicator? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nGene Lee: Hey, Andrew. Thanks for the question. I would say is we have done a lot of things to help increase staff flow \u2013 or applicant flow. And one of those that I talked about was the new system we put in place. We haven\u2019t really seen a dramatic change in staffing flow from when we put that new system in place to when the unemployment benefit started to eliminate. So we think we have been getting staffing flow even before that happened. We have, as we said, staffing challenges. And the challenges are a little bit more in certain parts of the country, but not necessarily driven by unemployment benefits. It\u2019s just driven by when they have opened up versus not when they have opened up. We are not so worried about getting great applicants, because we are getting them right now.\nAndrew Charles: Yes. And then my follow-up question is that you have called out prior to the pandemic that Olive Garden could reach 20% of sales off-premise. And obviously, with the rebound in the dine-in business, you are seeing that off-premise mix come down a bit still sticky. You are now accounting for about 27% of the brand sales. Do you think this is a fair mix of sales that you can sustainably see going forward or is it likely to further come down as staffing challenges ultimately ease and you can fulfill more on-premise dining?\nGene Lee: Yes, Andrew, I still think that the off-premise mix will come down at Olive Garden and at LongHorn as the dining rooms continue to fill and people feel more comfortable going out to eat in a restaurant. We were starting to see that some when COVID was winding down before the Delta variant spiked. We were starting to see our percent of sales go down. And then when the Delta variant spike came back, we started to see that percent go back up. So, we don\u2019t believe that 27% is where we will be in the immediate long-term after COVID is over. We still think somewhere in the 20s, but that all depends. I mean, we have made a lot of great investments in our technology. We have made it easier for our team members to handle all of the orders. We have made it easier for our guests to order, to pay, to do the things that I mentioned in the earnings \u2013 in the call. And so we do believe that our To Go as a percent of sales is going to be greater than it was than we ever thought it would be before COVID. That\u2019s because we are getting a lot of people that have come to Olive Garden into LongHorn that hadn\u2019t done that \u2013 hadn\u2019t done To Go before. So \u2013 and they are getting a great experience.\nAndrew Charles: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question today comes from Jared Garber of Goldman Sachs.\nJared Garber: Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, the LongHorn trends remain very robust and I think it was really encouraging to see the Fine Dining segment turned positive this quarter. Can you talk about what you are seeing in terms of pent-up demand and consumer trade-up? It seems like the Steak category remains really strong, maybe even relative to some of the other brands. And I wonder if some of that trade-up is sort of not benefiting Olive Garden as much despite some of the reduced pro activities in that brand?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think that might be overthinking it just a little bit. I mean the steakhouse category has been strengthening even be pre-COVID, strengthened through COVID. I think that LongHorn as, as we have discussed, has benefited somewhat from geographical footprint that has been \u2013 when you think their footprint heavy Georgia, heavy Florida, I also think that we have made a lot of investments in LongHorn over the last 5 or 6 years. And I think they are really \u2013 they have come through. I would also say that operating these smaller footprints has been easier to \u2013 a little bit easier through COVID. We need a lot less employees to run at LongHorn. I think we are fully \u2013 basically fully staffed in that business. And so I think it\u2019s all come together and running real well. As far as Fine Dining goes, I mean we are thrilled to see the level \u2013 the sales volumes we did this summer in Fine Dining. I will tell you that there is still a heavy drag on Fine Dining in the major cities. We are still down 40% in our 3 Manhattan locations, a little bit less than that in the other major cities, but we are seeing a big uptick in Suburbia in Fine Dining, which has been fantastic. And so that business has been robust. I never thought in my wildest dreams, I\u2019d see the kind of absolute numbers that we saw this summer in Fine Dining, which has been fantastic. So, I think there is some celebratory out there. I think that \u2013 I think people who aren\u2019t traveling for business as much as they used to are using Fine Dining restaurants maybe a little bit more on the weekend, which has been great to see. And I think the only other thing that I would say on Fine Dining is Sundays become a legitimate sales day in Fine Dining, which was really pre-COVID kind of a throwaway day and most \u2013 unless you are in a convention city and a convention start on Sunday, but Sunday is our real legitimate day now, which is taking \u2013 operationally has taken some adjustments for us to get used to.\nJared Garber: Thanks. Appreciate the color there. And I just wanted to follow-up on the unit growth commentary that you made earlier, Gene. I think it was really encouraging to hear that you\u2019ll likely be ahead of that at the top end or ahead of that 2% to 3% range in \u201823. Can you talk a little bit about the adjustments or the impacts you\u2019ve seen in the other segment and maybe some of the opportunities coming out of the pandemic in that segment for the restaurants within there?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think the biggest impact has been we transformed those business models, and we\u2019ve talked about the transformation we\u2019ve made at Cheddar\u2019s. Also Bahama Breeze had a significant transformation there. We\u2019re doing some good work in Yard House. We\u2019re making some more investments in the food. We\u2019ve got that business model in a good place. So we think there is good outsized, hopefully, good growth in that business. So we have a lot more confidence in investing on new capital into these segments. I mean we\u2019ve also \u2013 I mean Seasons is another business that\u2019s really made significant improvement, so that we\u2019re confident to reinvest in that business. So as the real estate becomes available, we have more options. We\u2019re confident and more options to use that real estate. So if we go into a market where we already have a great Olive Garden and great LongHorn, we have a property or a brand that we can put on top of that great piece of real estate and confident that we\u2019re going to get a really good return from that. And so it\u2019s given our real estate and development team a little bit more flexibility now that we have this confidence in these businesses that we can grow in.\nJared Garber: Thanks so much for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jake Bartlett of Truist Securities.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. My question is on the limited menu in Olive Garden. And I\u2019m just wondering whether there \u2013 do you have any concern that, that\u2019s impacting the recovery, the pace of the recovery and Olive Garden, whether that\u2019s impacting sales? I know it\u2019s been great for margins. In the context of that question, I think there is been commentary from some of the distributors that independents are reexpanding their menus. Is there a concern that as others kind of re-expand the menus that you guys might be missing on sales? And then I have a follow-up.\nGene Lee: Jake, I think that the limited menu is not impacting Olive Garden at all, and I\u2019ll go back to the context I provided in the beginning. If you just use the breakeven on the advertising, we\u2019d be up double digits in this business. And we don\u2019t do advertising to break even. Again, the recovery in Olive Garden, I think, has been stronger than most. And I define recovery based on how much profit we make. And I keep looking at that profitability number, and I\u2019m really pleased. So I don\u2019t think the limited menu is having any impact on our ability to drive top line in that business. I\u2019d go back to some of the things I outlined in the beginning. As far as independents adding menu items, more power to it. They think that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive their business, let them make those decisions. We\u2019re very comfortable where we are with our menus at this point in time.\nJake Bartlett: Great. I appreciate that. And following up on that, selling expense has been about 1% of sales for the last three quarters now. Is that the right level we should think about for the rest of the year? And maybe just share any thoughts you have on longer term, significant change from historical. So where should we be thinking more than near in the long-term in terms of marketing as a percentage of sales?\nGene Lee: Well, I think for the short-term, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us change our marketing strategies at all or, I guess, our tactics at all at this point in time. I think longer term, I think I\u2019m going to go back to what I talked about last call was, we\u2019re still waiting to determine what \u2013 what is the equilibrium of this business? What\u2019s going to be on-premise? What\u2019s going to be off-premise? What\u2019s the competitive set look like? This additional kind of ramp-up in COVID, I think, is stressing out more restaurants, so maybe there is going to be some more closures. I don\u2019t know \u2013 we don\u2019t know. And so we\u2019re just searching for equilibrium. And once we get to that equilibrium, we will develop a strategy and implement tactics that we think will best position our brands to be able to grow profitably into the future. But at this point for us to talk about that and kind of say where we think that\u2019s going to end up, that would be \u2013 that\u2019s just a huge mistake because we just don\u2019t know what environment we\u2019re going to be operating in.\nJake Bartlett: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One, Gene, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, specific to August, that trend slowed versus June and July, but still up versus pre-COVID. Just wondering how much of that you maybe attribute to the staffing shortage versus maybe the spike from a Delta variant perspective, just trying to gauge the impact from each. And I think you said September was up 7% per operating week versus the first quarter, up only 4.8%. So I\u2019m just wondering what your assumption is for the rest of fiscal 2Q relative to that September comment. And then one follow-up.\nGene Lee: Good try, Jeff. I\u2019m not going to comment on forward-looking on sales. I will just say that I will say in our commentary about the trends is that as COVID started to pick up, especially in the Southeast and Florida was hard hit where we have a huge footprint. You\u2019ve got \u2013 you had the impact of the Delta variant, and you also had back-to-school in a lot of these territories at that time. So we\u2019re having a hard time teasing out what was seasonality, what was the impact of the variant. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we gave \u2013 we\u2019re not going to get in the habit of given quarter-to-date sales at this call, but we felt that there was enough change in the sales environment that we wanted to be explicit that our sales have come back a little bit in September after falling a little bit in August. We think some of that has to do with COVID, some of that has to do, maybe there is a little bit less seasonality in the business. There is so many different variables impacting us week-to-week, month-to-month right now. It\u2019s very difficult to tease out. And so we\u2019re just being as transparent as we possibly can. You know where we\u2019re at quarter-to-date, and I\u2019m not going to comment on what. We\u2019ve given you guidance for the rest of the year, and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re going to be able to do.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just a follow-up more broadly on inflation, just wondering how you think about the restaurant industry and maybe even retail more broadly. It just seems like inflation is elevated. All industries seem to be raising prices and not getting much pushback from the consumer. I\u2019m just wondering maybe in your view, how does this end, whether for the industry or just for Darden, when you think about inflation versus pricing in the context of trying to drive traffic? Thank you.\nGene Lee: Jeff, I guess it\u2019s a very good question, right? So I think \u2013 first of all, I think we could all agree that lower income consumer is going to be disproportionately impacted by increases in inflation. And that consumer is a big part of our guests make-up for our casual brands. So we\u2019re incredibly focused on the longer term pushback, not so much short term. People say, well, we\u2019re pushing this off on the guest, no one\u2019s pushing back. Eventually, there is going to be pushback. And so we\u2019re making a strategic choice, especially in Olive Garden and I\u2019ll say for Cheddar\u2019s, is that we\u2019re being very cautious with pricing, and we want to make sure that this big group of consumers that we service feel as though they can still come to our restaurants and get an extremely great value for what they have to pay. And so I think that those who manage through this prudently, those who really take a longer look, we will get through this okay. I think those who pass through a lot of price that aren\u2019t really managing their costs effectively, I think we\u2019ve got to really think about how we manage our cost going forward. Because at some point, your average consumer could get priced out of casual dining, if it costs too much. And I think myself and my \u2013 and the entire team is really, really concerned about that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve made the strategic choice that we\u2019ve made with pricing. And so I think we\u2019re thinking about how do we position ourselves to excel in an inflationary environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Gene, a question on Olive Garden and the performance there and I appreciate all the factors that you mentioned on that that may have weighed on the sales for that brand. But I was just curious to get your thoughts on whether you think that was particularly acute in the quarter you just reported and some of those factors could ease as the year goes on or how are you thinking about that? Are you assuming those factors continue for the rest of the year or not?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think the one thing I would add that I did not mention in the comparables for this first quarter was 2 years ago, we were running buy one take one, which is a significant traffic-driving promotion. And we believe it does have some profitability tied to it. So that was weighing on the comparable performance in Q1. David, I really don\u2019t know. I mean, I think that we\u2019re looking at Olive Garden more on a bottom line perspective than just the top line at this point in time. It makes no sense at all any business today to be advertised and driving sales in the restaurants that are \u2013 you aren\u2019t assured that you are 100% fully staffed and can provide a great dining experience. Until we get to that and we feel certain that we have that every single day without having to deal with exclusions, we\u2019re not going to get out there and try to push people into these restaurants. It just makes no sense to me. And so when I look at what we\u2019re doing in Olive Garden and I continue to just be thrilled and continue to exceed my expectations. And it seems as though we continue to disappoint the sell-side expectations on this. But this is a very, very difficult operating environment. And I think that some of those things, if COVID, if you can tell me what\u2019s going to happen with COVID moving forward, then I can tell you that some of this stuff will ease. But when COVID is still prevalent in our communities, we\u2019re not going to know what the full potential or what I refer to as equilibrium is for a while.\nDavid Tarantino: Understood. And on the staffing levels, I just wanted to clarify. I think you might have said that you\u2019re running at about 90% of pre-COVID levels, if I heard that right. What is the targeted level? How does that compare to what you would ideally like to be? Because I think you had some efficiency gains that might lead to, I guess, lower levels than you had pre-COVID optimally. But I guess, where are you relative to optimal level?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, David, this is Rick. I did say 90% of pre-COVID staffing levels. Assuming the volume that we have today, right, so volume will drive how much staffing you need. So think about that. We probably need somewhere in the single-digit number of team members in our restaurants. We have some restaurants that need a little bit more because of the location they are in. But as I said, most of our restaurants are fairly well staffed. And so as the volumes start to increase, we continue to hire. And so it really depends on where the volumes end up. But we don\u2019t believe that we would need the same number of people that we did before COVID at the same volume levels with these new venues. Yes. And the other thing that\u2019s happening now is we\u2019ve got team members that are coming into the industry that may not be able to work the same number of hours. So it really all depends on the hours that people can work and the days they can work. So staffing levels in a number of people versus where we were pre-COVID probably isn\u2019t the best indicator, but it\u2019s a pretty good one. And again, as I said, we\u2019ve increased our productivity. So all equal, same number of hours for a person, same number of guest count for someone we would need fewer people.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Brett Levy of MKM Partners.\nBrett Levy: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess if we could just go both big picture and then more specific to you guys. If you could just parse out a little bit more on the competitive landscape, maybe a little bit more on the regionality and what you\u2019re seeing out there as well as if you\u2019re willing to share the market share data of how much share you gained in the quarter? And then also, specifically for you, you\u2019ve had great successes on the margins, both through your planning, but just also through your execution. Where do you see margins really hitting a ceiling, and I guess we can either do that for Darden consolidated or at LongHorn and Olive Garden specifically. Thanks guys.\nGene Lee: Good morning, Brett. I think let me just comment on maybe some regionality more so than get into the competitive situation. I think that we\u2019ve been very pleased with how California has come back. I spent some time in California this quarter. It was a lot different than what I thought it was going to be. So I think that our sales have come back there since the middle of July, very strong. So we\u2019re very pleased with what\u2019s happening out there. We felt some pressure in Georgia and Florida over the last 6 to 8 weeks with the Delta variant. Texas didn\u2019t have much impact, and Texas seems to have a mind of its own. The Northeast has never really come back from where it was. It\u2019s still performing okay, but hasn\u2019t really rebounded. And then we\u2019ve got pockets today where you just \u2013 you can just look at the heat map for COVID, you know that you\u2019re going to have some sales problems. So you\u2019ve got some Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia issues today. But overall, I mean, I would say there is not a tremendous amount of difference in regionality. As far as margins go, the way I would think about that is we will eventually get back to our framework where we think we can get to 10% to 30% once we figure out where equilibrium is. And I\u2019m \u2013 I don\u2019t think any of us should sit here today and say, what\u2019s the ceiling or where these businesses run long-term. We do think that we\u2019ve made some really great strategic choices over the last couple of years. We\u2019ve transformed our business models. We\u2019ve learned a lot. We\u2019ve learned a real lot through this on how to be more efficient. And I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see us give that up. And as long as we can continue to drive the top line, there is no reason why we can\u2019t hang on to these margins.\nBrett Levy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Gonzalez of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nEric Gonzalez: Hi, thanks for the question. I just want to go back to the comment about the quarter-to-date trends. And I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse here, but I was just wondering if you can maybe talk about the different performance of the different brands. Did you see acceleration across \u2013 broadly across all your major brands? Or was it just maybe specific to one or two of them? And then my real question here is on the off-premise business. Recognizing that you don\u2019t want to overwhelm the staff by drawing in traffic with advertising, I was wondering if maybe there is an opportunity to push harder on that off-premise strategy with marketing promotions given that channel likely requires less labor. Thanks.\nGene Lee: Yes. No comments on quarter-to-date. We gave you a number which I don\u2019t like to do and that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not going to talk about it anymore. As far as off-prem goes and trying to drive that, it\u2019s very, very difficult to drive that business specifically without discounting. And we don\u2019t want to discount. And there is \u2013 part of the labor problems and dealing with the exceptions impacts off-premise too. It takes less labor, but you still need to cook, you still need all these people to produce the food. And so we\u2019re trying to \u2013 when we think about this, we\u2019re trying to create great guest experiences, whether it\u2019s on-prem or off-prem. And as Rick outlined in his prepared remarks, dealing with these exclusions, I mean, it\u2019s not like we get a lot of notice that we\u2019ve got seven people that are excluded from the restaurant, and I was seven people short for the night. You got to adapt and try to overcome those challenges. And so I think that where we\u2019re at right now, we are doing some things off-premise without discounting. And on the weekends, we have to throttle the off-premise business. In other words, we can\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ve got to control how many orders we do every 15 minutes. And each brand has a different way of throttling. Each restaurant can throttle differently. But on average, I\u2019ll give you an idea is that we only take four orders to go every 15 minutes, and there are a lot more orders than that. And so \u2013 and I think that, that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s something that we know we have excess demand, but we\u2019ve got to be able to service the dining and service the off-prem.\nEric Gonzalez: From a margin perspective, the exclusion pay, are you able to maybe talk about what that might be just from an expense perspective, recognizing that the sales have an impact, but maybe there is an expense there from paying labor that\u2019s not present.\nRaj Vennam: It\u2019s not big enough. It\u2019s not a meaningful impact on the P&L.\nEric Gonzalez: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Company.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning guys. Just going back to the staffing issues, you talked about at Olive Garden that clearly are restricting the sales capacity. When you look at LongHorn, are they dealing with the same or similar issues from a staffing perspective. Obviously, it doesn\u2019t look like it when you look through the lens of just looking at the numbers. So if they are dealing with those staffing issues, can you just talk about why and the primary difference going on there between the two brands?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Rick. A couple of things about LongHorn, one is they have a smaller total team than Olive Garden does, right? So \u2013 and they actually were in parts of the country early in the pandemic that opened up a lot faster. So their staffing challenges aren\u2019t nearly where Olive Garden would be. And actually, right now, they have more team members than they did pre-COVID, but they are doing a lot more volume. So their staffing challenges are really the same thing on exclusions. And if you think about the exclusions, a lot of it impacts the kitchen. And so as long as they have got enough people working in the kitchen that they have an exclusion, they can continue to drive sales through that. It\u2019s not as big an issue for them. So if you think about a LongHorn, probably 60% of the total team members of a restaurant than an Olive Garden does. And so when you have exclusions, it\u2019s not as big of an impact for LongHorn.\nBrian Bittner: Okay. Great, thanks, Rick. And just with Olive Garden, aside from the staffing issues, how do you want us thinking about your ability to proactively drive the business in the future with more marketing and more promos? Meaning, are you just so pleased with this new profitability profile of Olive Garden that you really want this to kind of be the new base case strategy moving forward and how the brand operates? Or do you want us analysts thinking that you have this unused weapons that you could potentially deploy if you want?\nGene Lee: No, I think this is \u2013 Brian, this is the way to think about it. This is the base business. And what we\u2019re going to try to do is once we figure out where equilibrium is we will develop a strategy and implement tactics to be able to drive the business profitably. What we will want to do is put back in another $100 million of marketing, you only get $400 million in sales. And then you go back to some of the comments I made earlier is that we want to make sure that we\u2019re focused on value. We think that with this inflation going through, there is going to be longer term is going to be \u2013 the winners are they going to be the ones who provide exceptional value to the consumer. And we\u2019re trying to position Olive Garden to be that brand. It\u2019s historically done well in downturns. And if we have a downturn, we want to position it to do really well. I think we will promote again. Don\u2019t get me wrong. We will promote again. We just think we will do it differently. And we are thinking \u2013 we think a lot more about the opportunity cost around the value of that table when we\u2019re extremely busy and how not to have guests sitting at that table paying less than full price. Even though it\u2019s a value proposition, we don\u2019t \u2013 if we want to be value and focus on value, we don\u2019t want to be discounting off a value platform. And I think that\u2019s really important. And so we\u2019ve got to figure that out once we get there. We\u2019ve got contingency plans right now. We think we know what we want to do. But we need to see what the competitive environment is, and we need to see what the economic backdrop is.\nBrian Bittner: Great. Thank you, Gene.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. So just looking at trends across the brands on a 2-year basis, comp accelerated from the fourth quarter in May, all the segments except for Olive Garden. And I appreciate all the commentary on the differences on an absolute basis. But from a sequential perspective, are the dynamics the same? I\u2019m just trying to understand why just there is no change there.\nRaj Vennam: Hi, Lauren, let\u2019s make sure we understand the question. Can you repeat the question?\nLauren Silberman: Sure. So just looking at a 2-year basis, comps for the quarter accelerated from the fourth quarter for LongHorn, Fine Dining and the other business, reasonably flat for Olive Garden. So I understand all the commentary on an absolute basis on 2-year comps across the brands. Just understand from a sequential perspective from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, if there is anything to call out regarding sort of the factors on the acceleration versus for the other brands versus reasonably flat for Olive Garden?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. I\u2019ll just make a couple of quick things. I mean, when you think about like the other business, we got all \u2013 mostly Yard House back in the quarter. And Fine Dining, we got a lot more full capacity back in the second quarter. LongHorn has just the \u2013 steakhouse segment has just done extremely well. So I think that\u2019s really the big change.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. And I think the other thing is really the starting point is not apples-to-apples. That\u2019s what we keep trying to come back to is Olive Garden had a lot of \u2013 we talked about the promotion in Q1. We had a lot of market \u2013 the best \u2013 one of their best promotions and we had a lot of marketing dollars in there. So when you \u2013 when you\u2019re trying to compare it to the 2 years ago number, your starting point is off. That\u2019s where we would argue that\u2019s 10 points lower or more. So if you start with that, Olive Garden accelerated. And that\u2019s where there is some volatility when you look at that by brand because of the promotional differences.\nLauren Silberman: Okay. Very helpful. And then just on loyalty. You previously tested a loyalty program across select restaurants. I think we\u2019ve seen a lot of brands implementing them or looking to implement a full service date. So do you have any updated thoughts on the potential for a loyalty program across the system? Or what you saw in tests as you think about it?\nRick Cardenas: Hi, Lauren, it\u2019s Rick. Yes, we eliminated \u2013 well, we stopped the test of loyalty right when COVID started. We didn\u2019t believe it was the right thing to do during the time that we were making sure that we can get our restaurants open and up and running. We are working right now on everyday value. As we\u2019ve talked about for Olive Garden, we want to make sure that our value perception continues to improve. It\u2019s already great in all of our brands. And so right now, we haven\u2019t decided to even test again. That may come down to \u2013 may happen someday. But what we don\u2019t want to do is provide a loyalty program that provides a discount to the highest used consumer. So if we have a loyalty program, we will work on something that\u2019s different. Now I will say we were seeing positive trends in our loyalty program before. But that was a point-based discounted program that in the long run, we don\u2019t think is the right way to do loyalty in the restaurant business.\nOperator: We can move on to Dennis Geiger of UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you. First, Raj, just wanted to see if you could quantify the impact of the Thanksgiving shift on the quarter by chance?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. I would say at a high level, it\u2019s probably, think of it as about a 1% impact on a 2-year because we\u2019re comparing to pre-COVID, as you look at it, yes, think of it as about a point impact.\nDennis Geiger: Yes, thank you very much. Great. And then just wanted to come back on the technology front some impressive digital results as it relates to the digital mix of off-premise, so just wanted to get a sense for any additional opportunities that you can share that can support either that off-premise business or even the dining business as it relates to the top line or even some additional margin efficiency opportunities. I think geo-fencing is kind of an interesting one that you have highlighted, so, curious if there is anything to share there and how close that might be or any other opportunities on the tech side? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Hi Dennis, this is Rick. Just a broad message on technology first is our goal is to implement technology really that reduces friction across every part of the value chain and while we respond to growing desire for choice and personalization from our guests. They want choice, they want to be personal \u2013 they want personal experiences. And so one of \u2013 a few of the things that we did in the first quarter, just to give you an idea, we added Apple Pay and Google Pay to olivegarden.com. We were already able to use PayPal to pay for you To Go order. And now over 25% of our mobile app transactions are paid via PayPal and these other wallets, where it\u2019s much more convenient to our guests to pay. We have updated the curbside, I am here experience for our guests when they have to go. Still not including geo-fencing, but it\u2019s coming as well. And we have just started AB testing for Olive Garden and online recommendations for items. I am not going to talk about what we are doing in future quarters, but we have more improvements. We continue to invest in this digital platform. Our goal for guest facing is to lead our segment when it comes to relevance and convenience for our guests. And we will continue to do that. Will we lead the restaurant industry, no, the quick service players are going to probably spend more and do more things in technology, but we are going to learn what they are doing and see what we can bring to our space. But we are going to lead the full-service restaurant space in technology for guest facing.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We can go to Nicole Miller of Piper Sandler.\nNicole Miller: Thank you. Good morning. Two quick ones, on off-premise, can you talk about catering as an underlying trend than what you are seeing in catering?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Nicole, we haven\u2019t seen a whole lot of pickup back in catering yet. We did see during COVID more catering to homes than to businesses. But since business spending and people still haven\u2019t gone back to offices, we haven\u2019t seen a huge pickup, but we are seeing some. We are seeing some growth in catering, but it hasn\u2019t been dramatic. We will see what happens during the holiday season this year. But right now, not a huge, huge jump in catering from what happened while COVID was going on.\nNicole Miller: And then just a really high-level question around fine dining, you numbers are up like the industry peers, if not better. What is a fair assessment of some of the pluses and minuses of what we might think about for social or corporate gatherings coming up for the holiday season?\nGene Lee: Yes. I think it\u2019s all going to depend on where we are with this variant and what the levels are, especially in some of the bigger markets. I would sit here today and say I think it\u2019s going to be a robust holiday season. I think we have a robust holiday season for all our restaurants in all of retail. I think that the consumer is still fairly healthy from a financial standpoint. And we will know more in the next six weeks to eight weeks as we start thinking about we start seeing the bookings. One trend that we have seen over the last six weeks to eight weeks is we have seen a lot of cancellations of larger parties or gatherings inside the fine dining restaurants as people aren\u2019t as comfortable gathering in big groups as they may have been in the mid-summer. But I would expect this to be a robust holiday season if the variant is under control.\nNicole Miller: Thank you.\nOperator: We can now move on to Jeff Farmer of Gordon Haskett.\nJeff Farmer: Good morning and thanks guys. Just quickly wanted to follow-up on some of the menu pricing and value questions that you guys received, I think you pointed to holding menu pricing obviously well below inflation levels, but that has moved higher for you. So, I think menu pricing sit at roughly 1.5% in the last quarter. Where do you think menu pricing could go this quarter and over the balance of the year considering that that inflation \u2013 total inflation number has ticked up for you?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Hi Jeff, I will speak to the year. What\u2019s contemplated in our guidance is pricing just under 2%. So, if you think about our total inflation being 4% in this \u2013 in the forecast we provided, our outlook we provided, we are assuming pricing just under 2%.\nJeff Farmer: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then different topic, a lot of your peers, casual dining peers have been pretty aggressive in taking these delivery menu pricing premiums, which have improved the margin structure profile for that delivery offering. I am just curious, has that changed your opinion about potentially pursuing delivery, considering that there is a little bit better margin profile out there for that sales channel?\nGene Lee: No.\nJeff Farmer: Alright. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Mullan of Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Mullan: Hi. Thank you. Just a question on the long-term development opportunity for Olive Garden, you made commentary in recent quarters, a bit less worried about cannibalization you might have been in the past, more optimistic on the number of units. So, this question is what\u2019s your current thinking on the long-term potential here? Is there an actual number you have in mind? Could there be 1,000 restaurants? Could there be more? Just any color on your updated thinking?\nGene Lee: Yes. I don\u2019t think we want to put a number. I will say more than 1,000. We think that there is a pathway to get there. I think it\u2019s dangerous to say, I have been in this business doing this for a long time, and every time we run a brand, we put out numbers that we think are potential. The brand is really strong. We kind of get through those numbers pretty easily. So, let\u2019s just say we \u2013 one of our underlying belief is that convenience is going to continue to matter. We are going to need to build restaurants closer to where people live. And we also believe in, especially in Olive Garden that we can build in more remote areas that have these large, what I would call these like 60-mile trade areas where people travel in and out to get things and dine. And so we are pretty excited about where we can take Olive Garden, especially if we can maintain over 20% off-premise. That opens up some more trade areas. We just continue to open Olive Gardens and amazed. And we continue to be amazed at the volumes we do and then the returns that we are getting. So, we definitely think we can get over 1,000 fairly easily.\nBrian Mullan: That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris O\u2019Cull of Stifel.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Thanks. Good morning guys. Gene, I wanted to get your perspective on what you think is driving the industry labor shortage and how the industry can create maybe a stronger employee proposition to attract talent?\nGene Lee: Yes. First of all, I don\u2019t think the labor shortage is just the restaurant industry, I think it\u2019s a national problem. I think that we see it with our vendors. We see it in other places. We all have associated maybe with some other companies that we see this challenge every single day. So, I do think that as we think about the restaurant proposition, I think we have to all understand what do restaurant team members want. I mean they want an opportunity to be able to work in an environment that is well run. They want flexibility. They want growth depending on what they are using the job for. And a lot of restaurant jobs are pass-through. They are kind of \u2013 let\u2019s get from point A to point B. And I think as we have to continue to find ways to improve that proposition. I think that one of the things that I am really most proud of is how many people that come into us as an hourly employee and that we are able to get into management. We got \u2013 in the last three months or four months, we have got almost 500 team members we have taken from our hourly ranks and moved them into management ranks. And I love that growth. I love that opportunity. When I am in the field, I would love to meet these people and they are just \u2013 they are so excited about their future and their potential. So, I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think those who have resources, and I think this is where scale is going to matter, too. Those who have resources that can create employment proposition that\u2019s stronger than others will attract people. There is no doubt that I think that we are in a lot better shape than others in this \u2013 with labor at this point in time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to come down to be an individual situation, which company and, more importantly, it gets down to the restaurant manager, the GM and inside each of that box, can they create an environment where people want to work. And that\u2019s how we will attract people. Where we have our best leadership, we do not have people problems.\nChris O\u2019Cull: One thing you didn\u2019t mention was pay. And I am just curious if you think continuing increasing pay at kind of healthier rates or the rates that we have seen recently, if you think that will address the employment issue at all?\nGene Lee: No, I think you got to have competitive pay. And I think that\u2019s only one aspect of the employment proposition. There has been pressure on wage now for a few years, even before COVID. I think there will be pressure on wage as we move forward. But I don\u2019t think it all comes down to just pay. I mean, I think if you \u2013 I don\u2019t think the problems for the industry go away just because we are going to \u2013 if we pay more.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. I think the restaurant expense line was down 110 basis points on a 2-year basis in the quarter with comps up 5% over that time. Could you talk about how the company is doing this? And how much of that do you think is sustainable productivity longer term in your view?\nRaj Vennam: David, this is Raj. So, restaurant expenses per operating week were on an absolute basis, were slightly below. I think we are at about a point below where we were pre-COVID. We have found some efficiencies through the pandemic on some contract services and some R&M. I do think some of the costs will come back in a little bit, but it\u2019s still going to be a point of leverage. I mean a line that we are going to continue to see some improvement versus pre-COVID. Is it going to stay at the 110, 120 range, probably not. It all \u2013 again, also it depends on where the sales are. But we are managing \u2013 that\u2019s one line where we have been able to manage well and keep it fairly flat or actually slightly below where we were pre-COVID.\nDavid Palmer: Just a quick follow-up on that part is what are some specific things that are going on there? And then I just \u2013 separate question on the marketing and promotion side. I am wondering how you are thinking about marketing and promotion spending as you see some of these COVID era forces easing, a variety of them. So, more specifically, do you anticipate marketing and promotion spending returning to fiscal \u201819 levels in fiscal \u201823? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: So, let me answer the last question first. No, we don\u2019t expect it to get back to that at this point. But then on the restaurant expense line, like I said, it\u2019s really contract services. We continue to look at our vendors and continue to work with them on how to kind of optimize, streamline some of this, and that\u2019s part of that. There was a little bit less R&M that has been catching up. And I think by Q1, we are more closer to pre-COVID levels on that line. But there is a little bit more on that line that I think will come back. But beyond that, there is really no specific one item here or there. I mean there is music, there is other stuff that we talk about, but these are \u2013 it\u2019s in multiple places.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Barish of Jefferies.\nAndy Barish: Hey, good morning guys. Just a couple of kind of short-term questions, which I am sure you love. On the September numbers that you talked about, can you just give us a sense of the noise in the quarter so far? I know there was a Labor Day shift, I think with 2 years ago, obviously, weather. Just trying to get a sense of what you can tease out given all the other variables?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Hi Andy. So, we actually don\u2019t have a Labor Day shift because our fiscal years \u2013 we are giving you fiscal comps and our labor \u2013 because of the 53 weeks that we had in fiscal \u201819, we actually have apples-to-apples for Labor Day. There was clearly some impact from Hurricane Dorian that about 2 years ago that we had talked about that impacted the first few weeks a little bit. High level, maybe a point or so at the time, I can\u2019t recall exactly, but that\u2019s what I would say.\nAndy Barish: And then just finally on the margins sequentially, this is usually a quarter where you see a couple of hundred basis points of sequential decline in margins given the volumes are usually the lowest. Is that somewhat predictable this year, or just too tough to tell given everything going on out there?\nRaj Vennam: So, let me answer it without getting to the specifics on that. Q2 is one where we do think because of the low volumes and low margins to begin with, you are probably going to have a little bit more improvement than a typical quarter. But I would say that Q2 is also one quarter where we are probably going to have the highest inflation as we look at where we are sitting, right. And so, it\u2019s going to be higher than Q1 in terms of inflation.\nAndy Barish: Okay, helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to get back to labor and staffing in particular. I heard you were adding 1,000 net new employees per week, I think you said, which obviously is a great achievement. Can you talk about the quits rate at Darden just overall turnover and just as you are kind of hiring 1,000 people net, which obviously is much more than that gross? How you are feeling about some of the real-time operating metrics that you look at in terms of where those are versus standard? And assuming there might be a tick below, how quickly you think you can ramp back up to where you would like to be?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, John, this is Rick. On the turnover front, we are actually starting to see our turnover get improved dramatically from where it was kind of during COVID and even coming right out of COVID. We are still well better than the casual dining industry in turnover and especially in the first 90-day turnover, right. And that really is a testament to the training that we are doing to these new team members when they are coming in. Now, turnover is still higher than it was pre-COVID, but it\u2019s getting much better, and it\u2019s still much better than the industry.\nJohn Ivankoe: And on the operating side?\nRick Cardenas: Say it again?\nJohn Ivankoe: Sorry. And on the operating side, I mean, considering you are hiring so many new employees, I mean, 1,000 net is obviously much more than that gross. I mean if that \u2013 what that\u2019s translating in terms of some of your real-time operating metrics relative to the past? And if there is an opportunity to maybe improve on the margin given how new your overall staff is?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. I would say if you think about the percent of our team members that are in the first 90 days, they are not as productive as team members that are \u2013 have been with us for a year. And we do have a higher percentage of team members that are with us for the first 90 days than we were 2 years ago. So, there are some productivity improvements that we can do for those new team members. And we are spending a little bit more in training than we did 2 years ago because of that. And so there might be some chance to offset some of those things. But that will just come from inflation down the road. But yes, operating, we are operating well all of our operating metrics. If you think about our guest satisfaction metrics, they are still at the same levels they were over the last three months or four months, even with these new team members.\nJohn Ivankoe: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Wells Fargo.\nJon Tower: Awesome. Thanks for taking my questions. First and I apologize if I missed this one. But Raj, did you quantify the headwind that the exclusions had on OG sales during the quarter? And then second, Rick and Gene, throughout this call, you hit on the benefits of scale and how important that is to your overall business and frankly, how well your business has been doing despite the challenges that the industry has been facing. I would assume that many of your smaller competitors in the category are feeling the pain more acutely than you are. So, I am curious, given the benefits of scale your company could bring to the table, has your appetite for adding brands to the portfolio grown at all over the past six months or so?\nGene Lee: We did not quantify the \u2013 any impact on sales from the exclusions. That\u2019s something that\u2019s \u2013 we can\u2019t do that. No, we have no methodology to do that. As far as M&A goes, I mean, we are at the same place. We are a platform company. Management and the Board continue to evaluate options. And when we find an option that we think that makes sense, maybe we will do some. Right now, I would just pivot to say that we are extreme \u2013 as I talked about in my prepared remarks, we are really focused on growing our existing brands. We love how healthy our brands are, vibrant and how good strong the business models are. We think opening our own restaurants right now is the best way to create value for our shareholders.\nJon Tower: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro of Raymond James.\nBrian Vaccaro: Thanks. Just two quick ones for me, on the quarter-to-date, can you confirm that average weekly sales volumes also improved sequentially? Was the percent increase kind of more driven by lapping easier seasonal comparison, September is usually lower back-to-school? And then Raj, what level of G&A is bedded in your fiscal \u201822 guidance? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Okay. Brian, for September quarter-to-date, the numbers we are referencing are versus pre-COVID. So, as you rightly pointed out, there is a seasonality as you come into September. September is, I think, generally the lowest seasonal month for us and the industry in casual space. But with that said, on the G&A front, like I said, if you take out the $15 million of the unique items that we had this quarter, that would be a good run rate to use as you look forward.\nBrian Vaccaro: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just had two quick ones on unit growth and real estate. It feels like similar to yourselves, there is a number of brands that are talking about accelerating unit growth kind of coming out of the pandemic. So, I am just curious for your perspective on the real estate environment in terms of availability price. Are you seeing that kind of competition play out? And then secondarily, you have given several eloquent answers about why it makes so much sense to put up your own new units. I am just curious why you think 3%ish is kind of the right level at this point? Thanks.\nGene Lee: Yes. Unit growth, its acquiring sites as this was hard as it was pre-COVID. I mean it\u2019s people are out there competing not just restaurants or just not restaurants competing for space. I mean retailers use the spaces that we use. Banks use the spaces that we use. There are a lot \u2013 there is a lot of competition out there. It\u2019s definitely getting more expensive. We are seeing construction costs start to moderate. I will tell you that having been an investment-grade credit does help with landlords. And how we behave through the crisis and how we paid our rent is not forgotten with these landlords. So, I think that we have a very exciting group of brands to put on pieces of property and people are excited as Darden as the tenant. As far as why is 3%, where we believe the right number to be, it comes down to people. I think that the most important decision we make on running this kind of business is who is going to be the management team in that restaurant. And we need to make sure we have people that can handle that responsibility. Especially in our smaller brands, it\u2019s really tough to really ramp up that growth because you rip through your human resources quickly. Every time you open a restaurant, you really have two new general managers. You have taken an existing General Manager and Managing Partner from an existing business, putting them in a new business and then you got somebody new in the existing business. So, you have two businesses at risk. And we are doing this for the amount of years that I have done it. I think that for Darden, 3% growth rate is really maxing out our human resources and our ability to do this correctly. And it takes a lot to open a restaurant. It takes a real lot to open a restaurant, and we need to do it right. And if you don\u2019t open a restaurant right and get it right in that first six months, they tend to be a problem for up to 3 years. And that\u2019s why we are pretty conservative on how we think about this.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great, very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: We can go to Chris Carril of RBC Capital Markets.\nChris Carril: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. So, you offered some commentary around guest-facing technology, but curious to hear your thoughts on investing in technology that helps on the labor side. I believe you mentioned tech related to eating in-restaurant operations, but maybe anything else that\u2019s related to hiring or related to scheduling? Any additional detail on tech focused on labor and staffing would be helpful? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Chris, this is Rick. We do \u2013 in the restaurant-facing things that aren\u2019t guest-facing, our primary goal is to improve productivity and simplify processes. We believe we have a world-class scheduling system, and that does a great job taking the General Manager\u2019s forecast and scheduling a great schedule. What isn\u2019t world-class, and it is the user interface for the manager to make it easier for them. So, we continue to do things to make it easier for managers to do things faster, so they can get with guests and they can train their team members and be with guests more. We have some things for our team members and what we have done with To Go in the kitchen. And we are looking at machine learning and AI to do better forecasting. So, there is a lot of things that we are working on, especially in the kitchen, making it easier to order and receive product, do inventory and those kind of things. On the service side, we are testing a few things that may make it easier for them. But what we don\u2019t want to do is have technology override the experience for the guests. So, we will continue to make these investments in our technology, in our kitchen technology and our To Go technology to help improve productivity.\nChris Carril: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just quickly, just following back up on the topic of reduced industry supply from competitor closures. Just curious if you have any observations you can share from markets where perhaps you saw more competitor closures versus markets where there were less closures, right? Just really just trying to get a sense of to what extent there has been any \u2013 or to what extent there has been a benefit from industry closures? Thanks.\nGene Lee: I would say there is two ways to think about it. Number one, in your Tier 1 trade areas, you are not going to see a lot of closures, right. So, even in a below average restaurant can make it in a Tier 1 environment, unless the rent is too onerous. So, you are seeing more of the closures in your secondary and tertiary sites, especially from independents in the casual space and some chain restaurants. Now in some of the Tier 1 sites, you are seeing some independent closure on fine dining. I believe that those will be the first to come back. Those are built out as restaurants. They will get recapitalized very quickly going to let chef and other owners. So, I do think those will come back. But I would summarize this by saying you are not seeing in your Tier 1. You are seeing it more in your tertiary areas where you have seen a lot of closures.\nChris Carril: Got it. Okay. Thanks for all the detail today.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Kalicak, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nKevin Kalicak: Thanks, Kevin. That concludes our call. I would like to remind everyone that we plan to release second quarter results on Friday, December 17th, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gene Lee",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin and good morning everyone. As you saw from our release this morning, we had a very good quarter. Our teams continue to operate effectively in a challenging environment and I am proud of their focus and ability to deliver another quarter of strong sales and profitability. All of our segments delivered record first quarter profit. Our ability to drive profitable sales growth is a testament to the strength of our business model and our continued adherence to the strategy we implemented 6 years ago. Our brands remain laser focused on executing our back to basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere, while at the Darden level, we concentrate on strengthening and leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Our first quarter sales trends started strong as momentum carried over from the fourth quarter and they further strengthened and peaked in July. However, in August, sales slowed due to the impact of the Delta variant, but remained positive relative to pre-COVID levels. For the first quarter, sales per operating week were up 4.8% relative to pre-COVID. And through the first 3 weeks in September, sales per operating week were up approximately 7% relative to pre-COVID. Regardless of the operating environment, our unwavering commitment to our strategy ensures we will stay focused on what we do best, providing exceptional guest experiences. Throughout this unique period, our operators have shown tremendous flexibility while remaining locked in on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. At the same time, our focus helps us continue to find ways to make our competitive advantages work even harder for us. One of the ways we do this is by leveraging our ability to open value-creating new restaurants. We opened 7 new restaurants during the quarter, all of which are exceeding our expectations. And we remain on track to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year. Our long-term framework calls for 2% to 3% sales growth from new restaurants. Given our stronger unit economics, our development team is working hard to build out a pipeline of locations for fiscal \u201823 and beyond that would put us at or above the higher end of our framework. Before I turn it over to Rick, I want to thank our team members in our restaurants and our support center. As I visit our restaurants and talk with our teams, I am constantly reminded why our people are our greatest competitive advantage. Their passion for being of service to our guests and each other fuels our success. Rick? Yes. Let me take a stab at this a little broader, John and just the coupons, because I am not sure we can get right to the number that you are looking for. I mean I think the coupon number probably was about 1% of sales. And so trying to say, okay, what's that driving guest count? I think that's a little bit harder to get at. When I look at that line in the P&L, it's about \u2013 it was about 1%. Let me just put Olive Garden's performance in context for everybody. Obviously, I am thrilled with their performance. We only have 2.5% check in the business over the last 2 years. That's compared to a little over 5% for the industry. I mean, that's a strategic choice that we continue to make and we think it's the right choice. And if you just assume that the marketing was breakeven, I mean, you got to add another 10 points to the sales. And so basically, they are flat, flattish and you take out that marketing, that's a big number. The other thing and then Rick alluded to this in his script I mean we are still struggling from a staffing standpoint, primarily because of the exclusions. And if you think about that, that's limiting our sales. And it's just \u2013 and the way I think about it, it's just another way of capacity limitation. Just if you just think about it, on average, I guess we have one or two sections closed in most of our restaurants, most nights. So we are losing 6 to 8 tables. So there is, especially in Olive Garden, that's putting a cap on what we can do for sales. So, when I think about the overall and I sum up Olive Garden's performance, I just think that we are doing unbelievable. We have got 23.2% restaurant level earnings percentage. Our profit grew $25 million over pre-COVID. This is just \u2013 this is an impressive business. And we are just \u2013 we are reevaluating over time how we are going to take this business to market when we think about couponing, when we think about overall promotional activity and full marketing. Hey, Andrew. Thanks for the question. I would say is we have done a lot of things to help increase staff flow \u2013 or applicant flow. And one of those that I talked about was the new system we put in place. We haven't really seen a dramatic change in staffing flow from when we put that new system in place to when the unemployment benefit started to eliminate. So we think we have been getting staffing flow even before that happened. We have, as we said, staffing challenges. And the challenges are a little bit more in certain parts of the country, but not necessarily driven by unemployment benefits. It's just driven by when they have opened up versus not when they have opened up. We are not so worried about getting great applicants, because we are getting them right now. Yes, Andrew, I still think that the off-premise mix will come down at Olive Garden and at LongHorn as the dining rooms continue to fill and people feel more comfortable going out to eat in a restaurant. We were starting to see that some when COVID was winding down before the Delta variant spiked. We were starting to see our percent of sales go down. And then when the Delta variant spike came back, we started to see that percent go back up. So, we don't believe that 27% is where we will be in the immediate long-term after COVID is over. We still think somewhere in the 20s, but that all depends. I mean, we have made a lot of great investments in our technology. We have made it easier for our team members to handle all of the orders. We have made it easier for our guests to order, to pay, to do the things that I mentioned in the earnings \u2013 in the call. And so we do believe that our To Go as a percent of sales is going to be greater than it was than we ever thought it would be before COVID. That's because we are getting a lot of people that have come to Olive Garden into LongHorn that hadn't done that \u2013 hadn't done To Go before. So \u2013 and they are getting a great experience. Yes. I think that might be overthinking it just a little bit. I mean the steakhouse category has been strengthening even be pre-COVID, strengthened through COVID. I think that LongHorn as, as we have discussed, has benefited somewhat from geographical footprint that has been \u2013 when you think their footprint heavy Georgia, heavy Florida, I also think that we have made a lot of investments in LongHorn over the last 5 or 6 years. And I think they are really \u2013 they have come through. I would also say that operating these smaller footprints has been easier to \u2013 a little bit easier through COVID. We need a lot less employees to run at LongHorn. I think we are fully \u2013 basically fully staffed in that business. And so I think it's all come together and running real well. As far as Fine Dining goes, I mean we are thrilled to see the level \u2013 the sales volumes we did this summer in Fine Dining. I will tell you that there is still a heavy drag on Fine Dining in the major cities. We are still down 40% in our 3 Manhattan locations, a little bit less than that in the other major cities, but we are seeing a big uptick in Suburbia in Fine Dining, which has been fantastic. And so that business has been robust. I never thought in my wildest dreams, I'd see the kind of absolute numbers that we saw this summer in Fine Dining, which has been fantastic. So, I think there is some celebratory out there. I think that \u2013 I think people who aren't traveling for business as much as they used to are using Fine Dining restaurants maybe a little bit more on the weekend, which has been great to see. And I think the only other thing that I would say on Fine Dining is Sundays become a legitimate sales day in Fine Dining, which was really pre-COVID kind of a throwaway day and most \u2013 unless you are in a convention city and a convention start on Sunday, but Sunday is our real legitimate day now, which is taking \u2013 operationally has taken some adjustments for us to get used to. Yes. I think the biggest impact has been we transformed those business models, and we've talked about the transformation we've made at Cheddar's. Also Bahama Breeze had a significant transformation there. We're doing some good work in Yard House. We're making some more investments in the food. We've got that business model in a good place. So we think there is good outsized, hopefully, good growth in that business. So we have a lot more confidence in investing on new capital into these segments. I mean we've also \u2013 I mean Seasons is another business that's really made significant improvement, so that we're confident to reinvest in that business. So as the real estate becomes available, we have more options. We're confident and more options to use that real estate. So if we go into a market where we already have a great Olive Garden and great LongHorn, we have a property or a brand that we can put on top of that great piece of real estate and confident that we're going to get a really good return from that. And so it's given our real estate and development team a little bit more flexibility now that we have this confidence in these businesses that we can grow in. Jake, I think that the limited menu is not impacting Olive Garden at all, and I'll go back to the context I provided in the beginning. If you just use the breakeven on the advertising, we'd be up double digits in this business. And we don't do advertising to break even. Again, the recovery in Olive Garden, I think, has been stronger than most. And I define recovery based on how much profit we make. And I keep looking at that profitability number, and I'm really pleased. So I don't think the limited menu is having any impact on our ability to drive top line in that business. I'd go back to some of the things I outlined in the beginning. As far as independents adding menu items, more power to it. They think that's what's going to drive their business, let them make those decisions. We're very comfortable where we are with our menus at this point in time. Well, I think for the short-term, I think \u2013 I don't think you'll see us change our marketing strategies at all or, I guess, our tactics at all at this point in time. I think longer term, I think I'm going to go back to what I talked about last call was, we're still waiting to determine what \u2013 what is the equilibrium of this business? What's going to be on-premise? What's going to be off-premise? What's the competitive set look like? This additional kind of ramp-up in COVID, I think, is stressing out more restaurants, so maybe there is going to be some more closures. I don't know \u2013 we don't know. And so we're just searching for equilibrium. And once we get to that equilibrium, we will develop a strategy and implement tactics that we think will best position our brands to be able to grow profitably into the future. But at this point for us to talk about that and kind of say where we think that's going to end up, that would be \u2013 that's just a huge mistake because we just don't know what environment we're going to be operating in. Good try, Jeff. I'm not going to comment on forward-looking on sales. I will just say that I will say in our commentary about the trends is that as COVID started to pick up, especially in the Southeast and Florida was hard hit where we have a huge footprint. You've got \u2013 you had the impact of the Delta variant, and you also had back-to-school in a lot of these territories at that time. So we're having a hard time teasing out what was seasonality, what was the impact of the variant. And that's one of the reasons why we gave \u2013 we're not going to get in the habit of given quarter-to-date sales at this call, but we felt that there was enough change in the sales environment that we wanted to be explicit that our sales have come back a little bit in September after falling a little bit in August. We think some of that has to do with COVID, some of that has to do, maybe there is a little bit less seasonality in the business. There is so many different variables impacting us week-to-week, month-to-month right now. It's very difficult to tease out. And so we're just being as transparent as we possibly can. You know where we're at quarter-to-date, and I'm not going to comment on what. We've given you guidance for the rest of the year, and that's what we think we're going to be able to do. Jeff, I guess it's a very good question, right? So I think \u2013 first of all, I think we could all agree that lower income consumer is going to be disproportionately impacted by increases in inflation. And that consumer is a big part of our guests make-up for our casual brands. So we're incredibly focused on the longer term pushback, not so much short term. People say, well, we're pushing this off on the guest, no one's pushing back. Eventually, there is going to be pushback. And so we're making a strategic choice, especially in Olive Garden and I'll say for Cheddar's, is that we're being very cautious with pricing, and we want to make sure that this big group of consumers that we service feel as though they can still come to our restaurants and get an extremely great value for what they have to pay. And so I think that those who manage through this prudently, those who really take a longer look, we will get through this okay. I think those who pass through a lot of price that aren't really managing their costs effectively, I think we've got to really think about how we manage our cost going forward. Because at some point, your average consumer could get priced out of casual dining, if it costs too much. And I think myself and my \u2013 and the entire team is really, really concerned about that. And that's why we've made the strategic choice that we've made with pricing. And so I think we're thinking about how do we position ourselves to excel in an inflationary environment. Yes. I think the one thing I would add that I did not mention in the comparables for this first quarter was 2 years ago, we were running buy one take one, which is a significant traffic-driving promotion. And we believe it does have some profitability tied to it. So that was weighing on the comparable performance in Q1. David, I really don't know. I mean, I think that we're looking at Olive Garden more on a bottom line perspective than just the top line at this point in time. It makes no sense at all any business today to be advertised and driving sales in the restaurants that are \u2013 you aren't assured that you are 100% fully staffed and can provide a great dining experience. Until we get to that and we feel certain that we have that every single day without having to deal with exclusions, we're not going to get out there and try to push people into these restaurants. It just makes no sense to me. And so when I look at what we're doing in Olive Garden and I continue to just be thrilled and continue to exceed my expectations. And it seems as though we continue to disappoint the sell-side expectations on this. But this is a very, very difficult operating environment. And I think that some of those things, if COVID, if you can tell me what's going to happen with COVID moving forward, then I can tell you that some of this stuff will ease. But when COVID is still prevalent in our communities, we're not going to know what the full potential or what I refer to as equilibrium is for a while. Good morning, Brett. I think let me just comment on maybe some regionality more so than get into the competitive situation. I think that we've been very pleased with how California has come back. I spent some time in California this quarter. It was a lot different than what I thought it was going to be. So I think that our sales have come back there since the middle of July, very strong. So we're very pleased with what's happening out there. We felt some pressure in Georgia and Florida over the last 6 to 8 weeks with the Delta variant. Texas didn't have much impact, and Texas seems to have a mind of its own. The Northeast has never really come back from where it was. It's still performing okay, but hasn't really rebounded. And then we've got pockets today where you just \u2013 you can just look at the heat map for COVID, you know that you're going to have some sales problems. So you've got some Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia issues today. But overall, I mean, I would say there is not a tremendous amount of difference in regionality. As far as margins go, the way I would think about that is we will eventually get back to our framework where we think we can get to 10% to 30% once we figure out where equilibrium is. And I'm \u2013 I don't think any of us should sit here today and say, what's the ceiling or where these businesses run long-term. We do think that we've made some really great strategic choices over the last couple of years. We've transformed our business models. We've learned a lot. We've learned a real lot through this on how to be more efficient. And I don't think you'll see us give that up. And as long as we can continue to drive the top line, there is no reason why we can't hang on to these margins. Yes. No comments on quarter-to-date. We gave you a number which I don't like to do and that's \u2013 I'm not going to talk about it anymore. As far as off-prem goes and trying to drive that, it's very, very difficult to drive that business specifically without discounting. And we don't want to discount. And there is \u2013 part of the labor problems and dealing with the exceptions impacts off-premise too. It takes less labor, but you still need to cook, you still need all these people to produce the food. And so we're trying to \u2013 when we think about this, we're trying to create great guest experiences, whether it's on-prem or off-prem. And as Rick outlined in his prepared remarks, dealing with these exclusions, I mean, it's not like we get a lot of notice that we've got seven people that are excluded from the restaurant, and I was seven people short for the night. You got to adapt and try to overcome those challenges. And so I think that where we're at right now, we are doing some things off-premise without discounting. And on the weekends, we have to throttle the off-premise business. In other words, we can't \u2013 we've got to control how many orders we do every 15 minutes. And each brand has a different way of throttling. Each restaurant can throttle differently. But on average, I'll give you an idea is that we only take four orders to go every 15 minutes, and there are a lot more orders than that. And so \u2013 and I think that, that's \u2013 I think that's something that we know we have excess demand, but we've got to be able to service the dining and service the off-prem. No, I think this is \u2013 Brian, this is the way to think about it. This is the base business. And what we're going to try to do is once we figure out where equilibrium is we will develop a strategy and implement tactics to be able to drive the business profitably. What we will want to do is put back in another $100 million of marketing, you only get $400 million in sales. And then you go back to some of the comments I made earlier is that we want to make sure that we're focused on value. We think that with this inflation going through, there is going to be longer term is going to be \u2013 the winners are they going to be the ones who provide exceptional value to the consumer. And we're trying to position Olive Garden to be that brand. It's historically done well in downturns. And if we have a downturn, we want to position it to do really well. I think we will promote again. Don't get me wrong. We will promote again. We just think we will do it differently. And we are thinking \u2013 we think a lot more about the opportunity cost around the value of that table when we're extremely busy and how not to have guests sitting at that table paying less than full price. Even though it's a value proposition, we don't \u2013 if we want to be value and focus on value, we don't want to be discounting off a value platform. And I think that's really important. And so we've got to figure that out once we get there. We've got contingency plans right now. We think we know what we want to do. But we need to see what the competitive environment is, and we need to see what the economic backdrop is. Yes. I think it's all going to depend on where we are with this variant and what the levels are, especially in some of the bigger markets. I would sit here today and say I think it's going to be a robust holiday season. I think we have a robust holiday season for all our restaurants in all of retail. I think that the consumer is still fairly healthy from a financial standpoint. And we will know more in the next six weeks to eight weeks as we start thinking about we start seeing the bookings. One trend that we have seen over the last six weeks to eight weeks is we have seen a lot of cancellations of larger parties or gatherings inside the fine dining restaurants as people aren't as comfortable gathering in big groups as they may have been in the mid-summer. But I would expect this to be a robust holiday season if the variant is under control. No. Yes. I don't think we want to put a number. I will say more than 1,000. We think that there is a pathway to get there. I think it's dangerous to say, I have been in this business doing this for a long time, and every time we run a brand, we put out numbers that we think are potential. The brand is really strong. We kind of get through those numbers pretty easily. So, let's just say we \u2013 one of our underlying belief is that convenience is going to continue to matter. We are going to need to build restaurants closer to where people live. And we also believe in, especially in Olive Garden that we can build in more remote areas that have these large, what I would call these like 60-mile trade areas where people travel in and out to get things and dine. And so we are pretty excited about where we can take Olive Garden, especially if we can maintain over 20% off-premise. That opens up some more trade areas. We just continue to open Olive Gardens and amazed. And we continue to be amazed at the volumes we do and then the returns that we are getting. So, we definitely think we can get over 1,000 fairly easily. Yes. First of all, I don't think the labor shortage is just the restaurant industry, I think it's a national problem. I think that we see it with our vendors. We see it in other places. We all have associated maybe with some other companies that we see this challenge every single day. So, I do think that as we think about the restaurant proposition, I think we have to all understand what do restaurant team members want. I mean they want an opportunity to be able to work in an environment that is well run. They want flexibility. They want growth depending on what they are using the job for. And a lot of restaurant jobs are pass-through. They are kind of \u2013 let's get from point A to point B. And I think as we have to continue to find ways to improve that proposition. I think that one of the things that I am really most proud of is how many people that come into us as an hourly employee and that we are able to get into management. We got \u2013 in the last three months or four months, we have got almost 500 team members we have taken from our hourly ranks and moved them into management ranks. And I love that growth. I love that opportunity. When I am in the field, I would love to meet these people and they are just \u2013 they are so excited about their future and their potential. So, I think it's \u2013 I think those who have resources, and I think this is where scale is going to matter, too. Those who have resources that can create employment proposition that's stronger than others will attract people. There is no doubt that I think that we are in a lot better shape than others in this \u2013 with labor at this point in time. I don't think it's something \u2013 I think it's going to come down to be an individual situation, which company and, more importantly, it gets down to the restaurant manager, the GM and inside each of that box, can they create an environment where people want to work. And that's how we will attract people. Where we have our best leadership, we do not have people problems. No, I think you got to have competitive pay. And I think that's only one aspect of the employment proposition. There has been pressure on wage now for a few years, even before COVID. I think there will be pressure on wage as we move forward. But I don't think it all comes down to just pay. I mean, I think if you \u2013 I don't think the problems for the industry go away just because we are going to \u2013 if we pay more. We did not quantify the \u2013 any impact on sales from the exclusions. That's something that's \u2013 we can't do that. No, we have no methodology to do that. As far as M&A goes, I mean, we are at the same place. We are a platform company. Management and the Board continue to evaluate options. And when we find an option that we think that makes sense, maybe we will do some. Right now, I would just pivot to say that we are extreme \u2013 as I talked about in my prepared remarks, we are really focused on growing our existing brands. We love how healthy our brands are, vibrant and how good strong the business models are. We think opening our own restaurants right now is the best way to create value for our shareholders. Yes. Unit growth, its acquiring sites as this was hard as it was pre-COVID. I mean it's people are out there competing not just restaurants or just not restaurants competing for space. I mean retailers use the spaces that we use. Banks use the spaces that we use. There are a lot \u2013 there is a lot of competition out there. It's definitely getting more expensive. We are seeing construction costs start to moderate. I will tell you that having been an investment-grade credit does help with landlords. And how we behave through the crisis and how we paid our rent is not forgotten with these landlords. So, I think that we have a very exciting group of brands to put on pieces of property and people are excited as Darden as the tenant. As far as why is 3%, where we believe the right number to be, it comes down to people. I think that the most important decision we make on running this kind of business is who is going to be the management team in that restaurant. And we need to make sure we have people that can handle that responsibility. Especially in our smaller brands, it's really tough to really ramp up that growth because you rip through your human resources quickly. Every time you open a restaurant, you really have two new general managers. You have taken an existing General Manager and Managing Partner from an existing business, putting them in a new business and then you got somebody new in the existing business. So, you have two businesses at risk. And we are doing this for the amount of years that I have done it. I think that for Darden, 3% growth rate is really maxing out our human resources and our ability to do this correctly. And it takes a lot to open a restaurant. It takes a real lot to open a restaurant, and we need to do it right. And if you don't open a restaurant right and get it right in that first six months, they tend to be a problem for up to 3 years. And that's why we are pretty conservative on how we think about this. I would say there is two ways to think about it. Number one, in your Tier 1 trade areas, you are not going to see a lot of closures, right. So, even in a below average restaurant can make it in a Tier 1 environment, unless the rent is too onerous. So, you are seeing more of the closures in your secondary and tertiary sites, especially from independents in the casual space and some chain restaurants. Now in some of the Tier 1 sites, you are seeing some independent closure on fine dining. I believe that those will be the first to come back. Those are built out as restaurants. They will get recapitalized very quickly going to let chef and other owners. So, I do think those will come back. But I would summarize this by saying you are not seeing in your Tier 1. You are seeing it more in your tertiary areas where you have seen a lot of closures."

            "name": "Raj Vennam",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick and good morning everyone. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.3 billion, 51% higher than last year, driven by 47.5% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.76. We returned approximately $330 million to our shareholders this quarter, paying $144 million in dividends and repurchasing $186 million in shares. We had strong performance this quarter despite increased inflationary pressures, with EBITDA of $370 million and EBITDA margin of 16%, 250 basis points higher than pre-COVID. Our sales results were better than expected, requiring us to go out and purchase more product, on the spot market. In particular, proteins, as our LongHorn and Fine Dining segments had the largest sales outperformance versus our expectations. The market for proteins this quarter was very strong with spot premiums as high as 30% above our contracted rates. This resulted in higher average cost per pound for our proteins, contributing to total commodities inflation for the quarter of approximately 5.5%. Given the heightened attention on inflation, I want to clarify that we use a conventional approach to calculating the rate of inflation. We are only measuring change in average price, holding product mix and usage constant. We follow the same approach for calculating wage inflation rate in which we keep the hours and job mix constant and only look at change in wage. While we expect higher rates of inflation to persist for the remainder of the year versus what we initially planned, we believe our scale and recent enhancements to our business model enable us to deliver significant margin expansion, while still adhering to our strategy of pricing below inflation. Now, looking at the P&L for the first quarter of 2022, we are providing a comparison against pre-COVID results in the first quarter of 2020 which we believe is a more comparable to normal business operations and with how we have been talking about our margin expansion. For the first quarter, food and beverage expenses were 150 basis points higher driven by investments in both food quality and pricing significantly below inflation. Restaurant labor was 110 basis points lower, driven primarily by hourly labor improvement due to efficiencies gained from operational simplifications and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures. Restaurant expenses were also 110 basis points lower due to sales leverage. Marketing spend was $45 million lower, resulting in 220 basis points of favorability. As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin for Darden was 20.9%, 290 basis points better than pre-COVID levels. G&A expense was 30 basis points higher, driven primarily by approximately $10 million of stock compensation expenses related to the immediate expensing of equity awards for retirement-eligible employees. Additionally, we had approximately $5 million of expense related to mark-to-market on our deferred compensation. As a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, it's largely offset on the tax line. These impacts were partially offset by savings from corporate restructuring implemented in fiscal 2021. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.6%, which benefited from the deferred compensation hedge I just mentioned. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate would have been closer to the top end of our guidance range for the year. Turning to our segment performance, first quarter sales at Olive Garden were flat to pre-COVID, while segment profit margin increased 220 basis points. This was strong performance despite elevated inflation and 2-year check growth of only 2.4%. LongHorn had the best sales performance across our segments with sales increasing by 26% versus pre-COVID, while growing segment profit margin by 250 basis points. Sales at our Fine Dining segment increased 24% versus pre-COVID in what's traditionally their slowest quarter from a seasonal perspective. Segment profit margin grew by 490 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodity inflation. Our other segment grew sales by nearly 5% and segment profit margin by 360 basis points. We continue to be excited about the long-term prospects of this segment as it's driving the strongest underlying business model improvement of all our segments. Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022, based on our performance this quarter and expected performance for the remainder of the year, we increased our outlook for the full year. We now expect total sales of $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion, representing growth of 7% to 9% from pre-COVID levels; same restaurant sales growth of 27% to 30% and 35 to 40 new restaurants; capital spending of $375 million to $425 million; total inflation of approximately 4% with commodities inflation of 4.5% and total restaurant labor inflation of 5.5%, which includes hourly wage inflation of about 7%; EBITDA of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion; an annual effective tax rate of 13% to 14%; and approximately 131 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.25 and $7.60. This outlook implies EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID in line with our previous outlook as higher sales are helping offset elevated inflation. Before we open it up for questions, I want to remind you about a calendar shift next quarter. Thanksgiving falls in our fiscal second quarter this year, whereas it was in the fiscal third quarter pre-COVID. This will be a net negative to second quarter from its sales perspective. Now, we will take your questions. Sure, John. Let me start by saying we have \u2013 you saw us we increased our forecast for sales. So, that gives us a little bit of, I guess, less need to have to go back into the market than what we are already anticipating. So, some of that increased sales impact is baked into our estimate. As we look at Q2 and Q3, we have more visibility clearly into \u2013 a lot more into Q2 and some decent visibility into Q3. Q4 is one that's probably we will have to figure out where things shake out, but we do \u2013 we did have higher inflation last year in Q4. But all-in-all, the way we are thinking about it is, Q1, we had about 5.5%. We have about 80% contracted for Q2 based on the updated volume. And then for Q3, I think we have around 60% contracted out. So, we feel pretty good about that. Could there be some movement? Absolutely. But I think that's where we showed you, I think, in the first quarter how we have the ability to manage through that. I mean, I think the fact I mentioned about the business model improvements as well as other levers we have at our disposable \u2013 at our disposal to help us manage through that fairly well. It's not big enough. It's not a meaningful impact on the P&L. Hi, Lauren, let's make sure we understand the question. Can you repeat the question? Yes. And I think the other thing is really the starting point is not apples-to-apples. That's what we keep trying to come back to is Olive Garden had a lot of \u2013 we talked about the promotion in Q1. We had a lot of market \u2013 the best \u2013 one of their best promotions and we had a lot of marketing dollars in there. So when you \u2013 when you're trying to compare it to the 2 years ago number, your starting point is off. That's where we would argue that's 10 points lower or more. So if you start with that, Olive Garden accelerated. And that's where there is some volatility when you look at that by brand because of the promotional differences. Yes. I would say at a high level, it's probably, think of it as about a 1% impact on a 2-year because we're comparing to pre-COVID, as you look at it, yes, think of it as about a point impact. Yes. Hi Jeff, I will speak to the year. What's contemplated in our guidance is pricing just under 2%. So, if you think about our total inflation being 4% in this \u2013 in the forecast we provided, our outlook we provided, we are assuming pricing just under 2%. David, this is Raj. So, restaurant expenses per operating week were on an absolute basis, were slightly below. I think we are at about a point below where we were pre-COVID. We have found some efficiencies through the pandemic on some contract services and some R&M. I do think some of the costs will come back in a little bit, but it's still going to be a point of leverage. I mean a line that we are going to continue to see some improvement versus pre-COVID. Is it going to stay at the 110, 120 range, probably not. It all \u2013 again, also it depends on where the sales are. But we are managing \u2013 that's one line where we have been able to manage well and keep it fairly flat or actually slightly below where we were pre-COVID. So, let me answer the last question first. No, we don't expect it to get back to that at this point. But then on the restaurant expense line, like I said, it's really contract services. We continue to look at our vendors and continue to work with them on how to kind of optimize, streamline some of this, and that's part of that. There was a little bit less R&M that has been catching up. And I think by Q1, we are more closer to pre-COVID levels on that line. But there is a little bit more on that line that I think will come back. But beyond that, there is really no specific one item here or there. I mean there is music, there is other stuff that we talk about, but these are \u2013 it's in multiple places. Yes. Hi Andy. So, we actually don't have a Labor Day shift because our fiscal years \u2013 we are giving you fiscal comps and our labor \u2013 because of the 53 weeks that we had in fiscal \u201819, we actually have apples-to-apples for Labor Day. There was clearly some impact from Hurricane Dorian that about 2 years ago that we had talked about that impacted the first few weeks a little bit. High level, maybe a point or so at the time, I can't recall exactly, but that's what I would say. So, let me answer it without getting to the specifics on that. Q2 is one where we do think because of the low volumes and low margins to begin with, you are probably going to have a little bit more improvement than a typical quarter. But I would say that Q2 is also one quarter where we are probably going to have the highest inflation as we look at where we are sitting, right. And so, it's going to be higher than Q1 in terms of inflation. Okay. Brian, for September quarter-to-date, the numbers we are referencing are versus pre-COVID. So, as you rightly pointed out, there is a seasonality as you come into September. September is, I think, generally the lowest seasonal month for us and the industry in casual space. But with that said, on the G&A front, like I said, if you take out the $15 million of the unique items that we had this quarter, that would be a good run rate to use as you look forward."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Gene and good morning everyone. Our success this quarter was driven by the work we have done to simplify our processes and our menus to drive execution at the highest level. We also paused any new initiatives in order to further eliminate distractions for our restaurant teams and allow them to focus on what it takes to run 14 great shifts a week. In addition, To Go sales continue to benefit from the ongoing evolution of our digital platform. This platform makes it simpler for our guests to visit, order, pay and pickup, all while making it easier for our teams to execute at the highest level, both in the dining room and off-premise. This served our teams well as To Go sales remained high through the quarter. For the quarter, off-premise sales accounted for 27% of total sales at Olive Garden and 15% of total sales at LongHorn Steakhouse. Digital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and guest satisfaction metrics for off-premise experiences remains strong. As we navigate short-term external pressures, our focus is simple. We must continue to win when it comes to our people and product. From a people perspective, the employment environment is challenging. That's why our top priority during the quarter was staffing our restaurants. Our operators and HR teams have done a great job sourcing talent. We recently launched a new talent acquisition system that helps increase our pool of candidates by allowing applicants to apply and schedule an interview in 5 minutes or less. Additionally, our brands are successfully utilizing their digital platforms, including social media, to promote our employment proposition and drive applications. As a result, we are netting more than 1,000 new team members per week and our team member count is approximately 90% of our pre-COVID levels. The biggest operational challenge we have been dealing with is the temporary exclusion of team members identified through contact tracing. Given our commitment to health and safety, we are diligent about exclusions, but they create sudden staffing disruptions for our operators. Despite being appropriately staffed in the majority of our restaurants, these exclusions reduced the number of available team members with little notice for our operators to prepare. This volatility can negatively impact sales in these restaurants for the duration of the exclusion period. Getting and staying staffed also requires a strong focus on training. As we continue to hire, it is critical that we have the right training in place to ensure we continue to execute at a high level. That's why our operations leaders are validating the quality of our training during their restaurant visits, ensuring new team members receive the appropriate amount of training and successfully complete the required assessments. Our team members are the heart and soul of our business and we are constantly focused on our employment proposition. The investments we have made and continue to make in our people are helping us retain and attract top talent and I am confident in our ability to address our staffing needs. When it comes to product, our significant scale, including our dedicated distribution capabilities, enables us to manage through the challenges affecting the global supply chain and maintain continuity for our restaurants. Our supply chain team continues to work hard to ensure we successfully manage through any spot outages we encounter and our restaurants have the key products they need to serve our guests. During the quarter, we had to secure more product than usual on the spot market, because our brands exceeded sales expectations and some of our suppliers experienced capacity challenges. Raj will share more details in a moment, but these higher sales volumes as well as freight costs have contributed to higher than expected inflation. Our scale advantage provides the opportunity for us to price below our competition and inflation, which is a strategy we have executed successfully. Our competitive advantage of extensive data and insights allows us to be surgical in our pricing approach positioning us well to deal with these higher costs and maintain our value leadership. The rich insights we gather from our analytics help us find the right opportunities to price in ways that minimize impact to traffic over time. We still expect pricing to be well below the rate of inflation for the year, further strengthening our value proposition. Ensuring our restaurants are appropriately staffed and our supply chain continues to avoid significant disruptions will be the most important factors of our continued success in the short-term. To wrap up, I also want to recognize our outstanding team. I am inspired by the dedication and winning spirit that our leaders and team members both in our restaurants and in our support center continue to demonstrate. Thanks to each of you for all that you do to continue to create exceptional experiences for our guests. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Yes, David, this is Rick. I did say 90% of pre-COVID staffing levels. Assuming the volume that we have today, right, so volume will drive how much staffing you need. So think about that. We probably need somewhere in the single-digit number of team members in our restaurants. We have some restaurants that need a little bit more because of the location they are in. But as I said, most of our restaurants are fairly well staffed. And so as the volumes start to increase, we continue to hire. And so it really depends on where the volumes end up. But we don't believe that we would need the same number of people that we did before COVID at the same volume levels with these new venues. Yes. And the other thing that's happening now is we've got team members that are coming into the industry that may not be able to work the same number of hours. So it really all depends on the hours that people can work and the days they can work. So staffing levels in a number of people versus where we were pre-COVID probably isn't the best indicator, but it's a pretty good one. And again, as I said, we've increased our productivity. So all equal, same number of hours for a person, same number of guest count for someone we would need fewer people. Hey, Brian, it's Rick. A couple of things about LongHorn, one is they have a smaller total team than Olive Garden does, right? So \u2013 and they actually were in parts of the country early in the pandemic that opened up a lot faster. So their staffing challenges aren't nearly where Olive Garden would be. And actually, right now, they have more team members than they did pre-COVID, but they are doing a lot more volume. So their staffing challenges are really the same thing on exclusions. And if you think about the exclusions, a lot of it impacts the kitchen. And so as long as they have got enough people working in the kitchen that they have an exclusion, they can continue to drive sales through that. It's not as big an issue for them. So if you think about a LongHorn, probably 60% of the total team members of a restaurant than an Olive Garden does. And so when you have exclusions, it's not as big of an impact for LongHorn. Yes. I'll just make a couple of quick things. I mean, when you think about like the other business, we got all \u2013 mostly Yard House back in the quarter. And Fine Dining, we got a lot more full capacity back in the second quarter. LongHorn has just the \u2013 steakhouse segment has just done extremely well. So I think that's really the big change. Hi, Lauren, it's Rick. Yes, we eliminated \u2013 well, we stopped the test of loyalty right when COVID started. We didn't believe it was the right thing to do during the time that we were making sure that we can get our restaurants open and up and running. We are working right now on everyday value. As we've talked about for Olive Garden, we want to make sure that our value perception continues to improve. It's already great in all of our brands. And so right now, we haven't decided to even test again. That may come down to \u2013 may happen someday. But what we don't want to do is provide a loyalty program that provides a discount to the highest used consumer. So if we have a loyalty program, we will work on something that's different. Now I will say we were seeing positive trends in our loyalty program before. But that was a point-based discounted program that in the long run, we don't think is the right way to do loyalty in the restaurant business. Hi Dennis, this is Rick. Just a broad message on technology first is our goal is to implement technology really that reduces friction across every part of the value chain and while we respond to growing desire for choice and personalization from our guests. They want choice, they want to be personal \u2013 they want personal experiences. And so one of \u2013 a few of the things that we did in the first quarter, just to give you an idea, we added Apple Pay and Google Pay to olivegarden.com. We were already able to use PayPal to pay for you To Go order. And now over 25% of our mobile app transactions are paid via PayPal and these other wallets, where it's much more convenient to our guests to pay. We have updated the curbside, I am here experience for our guests when they have to go. Still not including geo-fencing, but it's coming as well. And we have just started AB testing for Olive Garden and online recommendations for items. I am not going to talk about what we are doing in future quarters, but we have more improvements. We continue to invest in this digital platform. Our goal for guest facing is to lead our segment when it comes to relevance and convenience for our guests. And we will continue to do that. Will we lead the restaurant industry, no, the quick service players are going to probably spend more and do more things in technology, but we are going to learn what they are doing and see what we can bring to our space. But we are going to lead the full-service restaurant space in technology for guest facing. Yes, Nicole, we haven't seen a whole lot of pickup back in catering yet. We did see during COVID more catering to homes than to businesses. But since business spending and people still haven't gone back to offices, we haven't seen a huge pickup, but we are seeing some. We are seeing some growth in catering, but it hasn't been dramatic. We will see what happens during the holiday season this year. But right now, not a huge, huge jump in catering from what happened while COVID was going on. Yes, John, this is Rick. On the turnover front, we are actually starting to see our turnover get improved dramatically from where it was kind of during COVID and even coming right out of COVID. We are still well better than the casual dining industry in turnover and especially in the first 90-day turnover, right. And that really is a testament to the training that we are doing to these new team members when they are coming in. Now, turnover is still higher than it was pre-COVID, but it's getting much better, and it's still much better than the industry. Say it again? Yes. I would say if you think about the percent of our team members that are in the first 90 days, they are not as productive as team members that are \u2013 have been with us for a year. And we do have a higher percentage of team members that are with us for the first 90 days than we were 2 years ago. So, there are some productivity improvements that we can do for those new team members. And we are spending a little bit more in training than we did 2 years ago because of that. And so there might be some chance to offset some of those things. But that will just come from inflation down the road. But yes, operating, we are operating well all of our operating metrics. If you think about our guest satisfaction metrics, they are still at the same levels they were over the last three months or four months, even with these new team members. Yes, Chris, this is Rick. We do \u2013 in the restaurant-facing things that aren't guest-facing, our primary goal is to improve productivity and simplify processes. We believe we have a world-class scheduling system, and that does a great job taking the General Manager's forecast and scheduling a great schedule. What isn't world-class, and it is the user interface for the manager to make it easier for them. So, we continue to do things to make it easier for managers to do things faster, so they can get with guests and they can train their team members and be with guests more. We have some things for our team members and what we have done with To Go in the kitchen. And we are looking at machine learning and AI to do better forecasting. So, there is a lot of things that we are working on, especially in the kitchen, making it easier to order and receive product, do inventory and those kind of things. On the service side, we are testing a few things that may make it easier for them. But what we don't want to do is have technology override the experience for the guests. So, we will continue to make these investments in our technology, in our kitchen technology and our To Go technology to help improve productivity."

During today\u2019s call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing fourth quarter performance is a comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. And any reference to annual pre-COVID performance is a comparison to the trailing 12 months ending February of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results today refer to Black Box Intelligence\u2019s casual dining benchmark excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen. During our fourth fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales decreased 0.7% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 7%. And during our full fiscal year 2023, industry same-restaurant sales increased 2.7% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 5.5%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks recapping the fiscal year, Raj will provide details on our fourth quarter and full year financial results and share our fiscal 2024 financial outlook and then, Rick will close with some final comments. Now I will turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid quarter to conclude what was a very strong year. Despite a tough environment, we significantly outperformed the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales and traffic and met or exceeded the financial outlook we provided at the outset of the year. For the full fiscal year, we grew sales by 8.9% to $10.5 billion, delivered diluted net earnings per share of $8 and opened 57 new restaurants. We also opened nine new international franchise restaurants in six different countries, which is the most we've ever opened in a fiscal year. The market responded positively to our performance, leading to a total shareholder return of 32.6% for the fiscal year. We have consistently delivered strong long-term shareholder returns. In fact, since Darden was spun off from General Mills 28 years ago, a period which spans multiple business cycles, the company has achieved an annualized TSR of 10% or greater over any 10 fiscal year period. Our restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level by remaining focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere. Our brand's ongoing efforts to drive execution through simplification enable our restaurant teams to create great guest experiences as evidenced by a record-level performance we saw from many of our brands on key holidays throughout the year. Nowhere is it more apparent than at Olive Garden, which achieved the highest sales day and sales week in their history during the week of Mother's Day. This focus on being brilliant [4:33] with the basics leads to strong guest satisfaction scores and our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain at or near all-time highs across our brands. At LongHorn Steakhouse, one of their most important metrics is their steaks grilled correctly score which is at an all-time high. To continue to drive these results, LongHorn recently completed their sixth Stake Master Series, which is their annual grilling competition and training program. Over the course of two months, thousands of culinary team members competed in this highly engaging training program for the right to be crowned champion and receive the $15,000 grand price. Congratulations to this year's Steak Masters champion, Kylie Hall from the LongHorn Steakhouse in Farragut, Tennessee. I am particularly proud of everything the teams in our restaurants and at the support center accomplished in fiscal 2023. For example, Olive Garden successfully introduced Never-Ending Pasta Bowl, which leveraged their iconic brand equity, was much simpler to execute and significantly improved margin while still providing tremendous value for their guests. Throughout the year, several of our brands ranked number one among major casual dining brands in key measurement categories within Technomic's industry tracking tool including LongHorn for food quality and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for value. And several of our brands were recognized as industry leaders in employment practices by Black Box Intelligence. Olive Garden, The Capital Grille and Seasons 52 were honored with the Employer of Choice Award and LongHorn and Eddie V's received the Best Practices Award. Throughout fiscal 2023, our strategy served us well. In addition to our back-to-basics operating philosophy, driving strong execution in our restaurants, Darden's four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and results oriented culture enabled our brands to compete more effectively and provide even greater value to their guests. Our significant scale allowed our teams to successfully manage through the highly unpredictable inflationary environment, while continuing to under price inflation over the long-term. All four of our advantages are unmatched within the restaurant full-service industry. These advantages are leveraged by our portfolio of iconic brands, all generating high average unit volumes with extensive geographic footprints. Our strategy is the right one for our company and our advantages were further strengthened last week with the completion of the acquisition of Ruth's Chris Steak House. Ruth's Chris enhances our scale advantage, fits our culture and complements our portfolio of iconic brands. We are so thrilled to add such an outstanding brand and high-caliber talent. And our experienced team is working hard to integrate Ruth's Chris into Darden with as little disruption as possible. I am proud of the results we achieved in fiscal 2023, and we will continue to execute our strategy to drive growth and long-term shareholder value. Now, I will turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.8 billion, 6.4% higher than last year, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4% and the addition of 47 net new restaurants. Our same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 470 basis points and same restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 540 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 15.2% from last year to $2.58. We generated $472 million in EBITDA and returned $183 million to shareholders. Total inflation slowed meaningfully this quarter to 4.4%, 270 basis points less than the third quarter, while the rate of pricing decreased from last quarter to 5.9%. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 30 basis points better driven by pricing above commodities inflation of roughly 3%. Chicken and seafood experienced deflation this quarter, helping offset high-single digit beef and beat inflation. Restaurant labor was 40 basis points better driven by productivity improvements. Restaurant expenses were 30 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage. Marketing expense was 1% of sales, consistent with our expectations and 30 basis points higher than last year. This all resulted in restaurant level EBITDA improving 80 basis points to 20.7%. Our general and administrative expenses were 40 basis points higher than last year, driven by the timing of our incentive compensation accrual as well as unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. Due to the way we hedge this expense, this unfavorability is largely offset on the tax line. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.4% and we generated $316 million in earnings from continuing operations, which was 11.4% of sales. Looking at our segments. Olive Garden, LongHorn and our other segment increased same-restaurant sales by 4.4%, 7.1% and 2.2%, respectively, each significantly outperformed the industry benchmark. The strong same restaurant sales performance drove segment profit margin at each of these segments higher than last year, especially at LongHorn, where segment profit margin of 18.6% was 70 basis points higher than last year. Same restaurant sales at our Fine Dining segment decreased by 1.9%, still outperforming the Black Box fine dining benchmark, excluding Darden, by more than 200 basis points. This resulted in segment profit margin below last year at the Fine Dining segment. This year-over-year sales decline was more the result of a wrapping on resurgence of demand in the fourth quarter of last year, which drove traffic retention to 108% of pre-COVID levels. Looking at traffic retention trends over the past three quarters, Fine Dining has been consistently between 101% to 102% of pre-COVID levels. We expect continued year-over-year traffic softness in our Fine Dining segment as we wrap on the first quarter traffic in fiscal 2023 that was at 107% of pre-COVID traffic levels. We expect traffic to stabilize on a year-over-year basis after the first quarter. As we look at our annual results for fiscal 2023, we had strong same-restaurant sales of 6.8% which outperformed the industry by 410 basis points and our same-restaurant traffic was 510 basis points above the industry. The strong top line performance drove $1.6 billion in EBITDA from continuing operations. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders and ended the year with $368 million of cash. Looking at our fiscal 2023 full year results compared to pre-COVID, operating income margins have grown 140 basis points. Food and beverage as percent of sales increased 380 basis points driven by investments in food quality and pricing well below commodities inflation. Offsetting this unfavorability were improvements in labor productivity, reduced restaurant and marketing expenses and G&A efficiencies. Our strong operating model generates significant and durable cash flows. Since 2018 we have delivered approximately 8% annualized EBITDA growth. At the end of fiscal 2023, our balance sheet was well-positioned at just 1.8 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR well below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times. And when we look at our performance compared to our long-term framework over the last five years, we've been achieved -- we've been able to achieve annualized total shareholder returns of 14.2% as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield. This is near the high end of our target and was driven by annualized earnings after tax growth of 10.2% above the high end of our framework. Cash returns were 4% which is at the middle of our framework. As we look to the future, we still believe that over time our 10% to 15% target for total shareholder returns is appropriate. However, we're increasing the share repurchase range to better reflect the impact of our share price appreciation since we last updated the framework five years ago. The updated share repurchase range is $300 million to $500 million. Before we get into our outlook for fiscal 2024, I want to provide an update on the acquisition of Ruth's Chris which we completed last week. This was financed through a $600 million term loan and cash on our balance sheet, bringing our adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR to approximately 2 times. As we move forward into 2024, sales and profits from Ruth's Chris company-owned and operated locations will be included in our Fine Dining segment, while revenues and profits from the franchise locations will reside in our other segment, consistent with the treatment of our existing franchise locations. However, Fine Dining same-restaurant sales results will not include Ruth's Chris until they have been owned and operated by us for a period of 16 months. As we mentioned in our conference call in early May, we expect to achieve run rate synergies of approximately $20 million by the end of fiscal 2025 primarily through supply chain and G&A savings. We also expect Ruth's Chris will be accretive to our earnings per share by approximately $0.10 to $0.12 in fiscal 2024 and $0.20 to $0.25 in fiscal 2025. We anticipate total acquisition and integration-related expense of approximately $55 million pre-tax. Now turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024 which includes Ruth's Chris operating results, but excludes the aforementioned acquisition and integration related expense. We expect total sales of $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion driven by the addition of Ruth's Chris store portfolio, same-restaurant sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and approximately 50 gross new restaurant openings, including four relocations. Capital spending of $550 million to $600 million, total inflation of approximately 3% to 4% which includes commodities inflation of approximately 2.5% driven primarily by beef and produce, while most other categories are flat to deflationary and hourly labor inflation in the mid-single digits. And annual effective tax-rate of approximately 12% to 12.5% and approximately 121.5 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $8.55 and $8.85. And finally, our Board approved an 8% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.31 per share, implying an annual dividend of $5.24. And with that, I will turn it back to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thanks, Raj. All of us at Darden continue to work together in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. During the year, we served more than 410 million guests. We also promoted nearly 1,300 hourly team members into our manager in training program and promoted 320 managers to General Manager or Managing Partner positions. And we continue to invest in our team members' development with new programs like Fast Fluency, which allows them to learn English for free. And our Next Course scholarship program that awarded post-secondary education scholarships worth $3,000 each to nearly 100 children or dependents of Darden team members. We also remain committed to nourishing and delighting the communities we serve through our ongoing efforts to fight hunger. As part of our Darden Harvest food donation program, our restaurants donated 4.4 million meals to local food banks in fiscal 2023. We also continued our successful partnership with Feeding America with another $2 million donation from the Darden Foundation that helped provide mobile food trucks to 10 different Feeding America food banks, bringing the total to 25 food banks across the country. The addition of Ruth's Chris gives us the opportunity to nourish and delight even more guests, more team members and more communities. As I said earlier, they are an excellent addition to our portfolio. And I want to welcome, Cheryl Henry and the nearly 5,000 team members from Ruth's Chris. We are excited that you are now officially part of the Darden family. I also want to thank our team members in our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout the year. We are fortunate to have the best people in the industry and I am proud of their commitment to caring for our guests and each other. Now, we'll take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Jon Tower with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks. I guess I'll start off, I'm curious to -- you had mentioned in your release the idea that the environment has gotten a little bit choppier in the fourth quarter. So I'm curious to see what you would -- if you could articulate what exactly you saw in the backdrop with respect to consumer behavior specifically at your own brands and perhaps industry-wide. And then, I got a follow-up on that, please.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Jon. This is Rick. I mean as we've talked about the choppiness of Q4, it was really fine dining going up against last year's very strong bounce back from Omicron. And so this quarter, as we alluded to at the end of -- in the third quarter, was this quarter is going be a little bit tougher for fine dining because of how they bounced back. And actually, Raj already alluded to the Q1, will probably be the same kind of toughness because of the bounce back last year. But that said, the consumer seems pretty strong overall. And within the restaurant industry and based on our internal and external data sources, there appears to be only minimal switching between lower priced occasions at this point. Not all that is switching, but some. And overall, we're not seeing anything concerning. What I will say, as you think about mix, we've talked about this before, we're not seeing material changes in our check trends across our core casual brands. There is no negative mix at Cheddar's. And we are watching add-ons and trying to understand if there is some cracks there. But we don't see any real cracks there. And -- but one area we're seeing a little bit of check management is with alcohol sales primarily at our higher end brands. And we think part of this is because of the function of last year, similar to the guest count trends we saw in last year, there was probably a little bit of euphoria in check last year. So that's kind of where we think about the consumer. And we didn't really think the quarter was choppy. We expected that to happen and that's what happened.\nJon Tower: Got it. Thanks for the clarification. I appreciate it. I'm just curious on the unit growth outlook as well. It looks like you're expecting slower unit growth openings versus what you had previously thought. Is that just a function of integrating Ruth\u2019s and at the same time CapEx went a little bit higher. So could you explain what's going on there as well?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. I think it's not necessarily integration of Ruth's. You think about what we're seeing on openings, CapEx was higher and where we wanted to be prudent as Raj said in the last call, we want to be prudent and making sure that we are earning a return that we really want to earn in our restaurants. And we've had some contractor starting to come back in and bid for sites that they stopped bidding for during the pandemic and even after the pandemic which should make bidding more competitive. We're starting to see that. And so we wanted to be prudent and make sure that we have the right returns and we still have great returns in all of our restaurants and that's kind of where it is. It's not really because of risks.\nJon Tower: Got it. Thanks. I appreciate the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nChris O'Cull: Hi, great. Good morning, guys. Raj, I had a question about the guidance. I'm just thinking if you exclude the $0.10 to $0.12 earnings accretion expected from Ruth's in the guidance, it looks -- it would seem to imply EPS growth below your longer-term outlook, particularly at the low end. Are you seeing any indications today that the underlying business could be softening I guess, or are you expecting it to soften over the course of this year? I'm just curious if you can give some color as to why the underlying business seems to be growing at a slower rate.\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Chris. I think, look, we're taking into consideration all the information we have, right. We think -- we build a plan based on all the information we have today. And if you look at what the consensus economic forecast is for the next year, it's flattish GDP and that -- in a -- if you look at last year where GDP was growing, the industry will still had negative traffic, right? So while we outperformed quite a bit and we expect to continue to outperform, we're taking that into consideration as we build a plan. But if you look at the midpoint of our guide, you do get to a decent base business growth and that's kind of how we build a plan and then the guidance range is to incorporate some variability around that and that's how we really think about it.\nChris O'Cull: So you're not seeing any softening today, you are just kind of keeping a more conservative outlook based on what the predictions are for the economy over the next 12 months?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. Well, I would say that it's not softening today. I mean if you look at the last few weeks, I think we're -- our GAAP to industry sale is fairly similar. But as we talked about, Q1, we do expect some softness in Fine Dining, that's just a function of wrap. But outside of that, no, we're not seeing any trends that would -- any recent trends that would indicate that there is a major change in the underlying environment for us.\nChris O'Cull: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey. Sure. Thanks. And Raj, just regarding the comp guidance, the 2.5% to 3.5%. Can you maybe talk about what level of pricing you're embedding within that outlook and how that compares to the -- to where you exited fiscal '23 which I think was around 6%? And then also, do you have an underlying assumption for the industry's growth rate for the year? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Eric. So the way we think about it is, our comp guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%, we expect to have pricing in the 3.5% to 4%, which would imply a traffic of flat to negative 1.5% for the year for us. That range would imply that. You can extrapolate from that what the implied industry can be. We're not expecting our GAAP to be significantly different going into the year, but we focus a lot more on things we can control. And we look at all the factors we have year-over-year and taking into consideration the macroenvironment and then just build a plan that way. As far as comp -- exiting the pricing, yeah, we exited the quarter with closer to 6% as we said and but we expect that to tick down throughout the year. So start with that, call it, 6%, but by the end of the year, by Q4, we get closer to the 2%. Now, lot of the pricing actions we took last year already impact next year's by about 3%. So the carryover from prior year is probably close to 3% and so that's really where we are.\nEric Gonzalez: Got it. And then just maybe as a follow-up to that, as you think about industries traffic remaining challenging and you mentioned GDP being flattish potentially this year, have you noticed any significant uptick in promotional activity thus far? And as the year progresses, how you think your promotional strategy might evolve and what levers could you pull if that's needed?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Eric, this is Rick. We look at what the competitor is doing. And you're seeing some promotional activity in competitors. We've got one major competitor that launched a little bit more TV or jumped back on to TV. But that said, our strategy remains the same on the marketing side. We're going to continue to be -- to have advertising Olive Garden because it's a big competitive advantage for Olive Garden, but we're going to continue to use our filters, first, elevating brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life, it's simple to execute and it's not at a deep discount. So as we talked about in the last call, we're going to stick to our strategy of core guest count growth. We'll react accordingly if something really changes. But when we increase our marketing spend, if we do, we expect it to earn a return. So we don't necessarily expect us to go back into the deep discount craze and that's our strategy and we're going to try to stick to it.\nEric Gonzalez: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to just go back to the 2024 EPS guidance, and kind of as a follow-up because as Chris suggested, yes, when you strip out Ruth's, you do have this lower implied core business earnings growth relative to your long-term framework. But the same-store sales guidance is slightly above this framework. So I just want to dig in there a little bit more. Is it being driven by underpricing inflation? I know you said kind of pricing at 3.5% to 4% but inflation is 3% to 4%. So, doesn't seem like you're planning on underpricing inflation that much. Just again trying to understand those dynamics a little better given the comp guidance is above your long-term framework.\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Brian. I think the way we look at it is, if you look at our framework or actually even excluding Ruth's -- the middle of the guidance for Ruth's is at $0.11 accretion. If you take that out, we're still in that -- a TSR that's north of 10% at the middle of -- at the middle of the guidance range. Now, one of the things I want to point out is, we haven't been able to buy back shares for almost three months now, because of trading blackout. And so that has an impact on EPS for next year. But even with that, like as we said, we still get to that double-digit TSR when you incorporate the dividend yield and the EPS growth.\nBrian Bittner: Okay. And the follow up, just as it relates to the total cost inflation outlook 3% to 4%, obviously realized commodities are up 2.5% within that total framework of 3% to 4%. Can you just touch on some of the other assumptions that's pressuring the inflation to be above the commodity outlook?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Brian. It's really labor. I expect the hourly wage inflation to be in that call it mid-single digits. And then their salary to be also closer to that. And some of that is a function of how we choose to pay our people. We are -- our merit increases have been above the industry and we think that's prudent. We want to continue to do that. And that's the type of investment we make to help us sustain the types of performance that we've been able to deliver. You look at a 400 basis point, 500 basis point gap to the industry that doesn't happen, magically. They are lot of things that go into that. And we are very thoughtful about how we make those decisions.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks, Raj.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. I wanted to ask you about your assumptions on same-store sales through the year. And in particular, if you have any thoughts about -- often a concern about multi-year trend slowing over this next fiscal year and how you're thinking about that potential in your guidance.\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. The way we're thinking about -- in terms of how we build the plan is that we expect retentions levels to be fairly similar to moderate a little bit relative to pre-COVID from where we were this fiscal year. So not a significant drop-off, but a little bit. But then, I think from a same-restaurant sales perspective, it's going to be driven by the pricing differences. The fact that we're going to start off with the higher price and then the price moderates down to -- the rate of pricing goes down to 2% by -- closer to 2% by Q4. That will have an impact on same-restaurant sales. As we think about guest counts, as I mentioned, the retention, we expect it to be fairly consistent quarter-to-quarter relative to last year.\nDavid Palmer: And with regard to advertising, what sort of assumptions are embedded into your earnings guidance for advertising spend?\nRaj Vennam: We basically are assuming somewhere in that 10 basis points to 20 basis points more than what we spent last year in total marketing. So that's kind of not that different from what we did in fiscal '23.\nDavid Palmer: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Given the slow macro forecast for 2024, I'm curious how that impacts your thinking around Never Ending Pasta at Olive Garden. The one value oriented promotion that fits your provincial framework. I guess the question is, are you open to changing the timing of promotion or perhaps in running it at two different times during the year to keep pace in the potentially slowing macro backdrop?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Andrew. For competitive reasons, we're definitely not going to talk about plan details. We do believe the Never Ending Pasta Bowl is a really strong promotion for us, especially with the changes we made last year. And so we'll look at any PB and if there's things that we can do with it. But definitely not going to talk about if we're going to do it twice.\nAndrew Charles: Okay. And then, Raj, please help us what's embedded within 2024 guidance for G&A?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. I think -- so, especially with Ruth's coming in, you should -- we ended the fiscal year with closer to $390 million. I'd say at this point, our best estimate is probably still maintaining closer to that 3.7% of total sales, which would get you closer to the call it $430 million for the year. Obviously, plus or minus 10 there. But that would be the number we would -- that is embedded in our guidance. Yeah.\nAndrew Charles: Helpful. Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Hey. By the way, as we talk about G&A, I just want to clarify one other thing. We do expect the cadence to be a little different. So, Q1 is probably going to be the highest level, call it closer to $115 million and then kind of tick down $5 million a quarter throughout the -- for the next few quarters. It's how we think about it just from a cadence standpoint. So there are some things that -- sudden specific variables that are influencing Q1 to be higher.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nChris Carril: Hi. Good morning. So, just returning to the same restaurant sales growth guidance for '24, can you provide any more detail on how you're thinking about your largest brands, Olive Garden and LongHorn and how they fit into this? We've been pretty clear so far on fine dining and how you expect comparisons to impact that segment in the very near term. But just curious if you could provide any additional thoughts in your largest brands and how they factor into the comp guide.\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. I would say the way we're thinking about it is our core casual brands are probably closer to the -- I guess, let's just go through the big brands. Olive Garden is probably -- would be in the middle of the range is our expectation going in. And then LongHorn would be outside of that range to the upside primarily because of stake inflation and the pricing there is probably a little bit higher, would need to be. And then Fine Dining to be a little bit south of that. And that's really how we're thinking about it.\nChris Carril: Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then, you mentioned productivity improvements helped to drive the improvement and labor in the 4Q. So how are you thinking about productivity improvements from here maybe in the context of Ruth's and then ex-Ruth's and just how much of a tailwind that could be in '24? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Chris. As we've said before, over the last years, our brands have done a great job improving productivity. We would expect to continue to have some productivity improvements over time, but not to the extent that we had during COVID. As we continue to look at improving training, having turnover come down, that should help productivity little bit. We're not going to have to discuss Ruth's right now. We've only owned them for eight days. So we'll have to just get through the -- getting through integration is going to actually probably be a productivity downer for them for a little bit. So let's let us get Ruth's under our belt for a little bit longer than eight days before we talk about the details there. But as I said, labor productivity, we should expect it to tick better as the year progresses as we continue to improve on our turnover and as we continue to improve our training.\nChris Carril: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your questions (ph).\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. Rick, I wanted to ask your thoughts on the current macroenvironment. And I guess your comments that the consumer seems pretty strong right now, don't actually line up with what the industry is seeing in terms of traffic. I mean, traffic down 7%. We haven't seen those types of numbers since maybe '08 and '09. So I'm just kind of wondering what your thoughts on traffic? And I know Darden's been outperforming, but I think even your traffic was slightly negative in the quarter. So, I guess what's your thoughts on what's weighing on the traffic and the overall environment?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, David. Thanks for the question. I did say earlier that we have not seen an impact in the consumer as much as maybe our competitors have. And I think there's a couple of reasons for that. There is a tension between what people want and what they can afford. And even in a slowing economy, consumers really continue to seek value. And it's not always about low prices, it's about execution, it's about what the experience to get in the restaurant or wherever they are. They're making spending tradeoffs. And as I said before, food away-from-home is really difficult to give up if you're executing. And so what we think about it is, what it means to our brands. What it means to what we do every day. And we believe that operators that can deliver on their brand promise and the value that appeals to guests, despite economic challenges, is what's going to get you to win. And that's what we've been doing. So whatever has been happening to the consumer and the economy and the restaurant space, we're going to control what we can control and what we can control is the experience that our consumers get in the restaurants every day and the value we provide. And we continue to hope that we're going to buck the trend of guest counts that the industry has. And we would expect to have a gap to the industry.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. Maybe just one follow-up on that. I mean, do you think pricing for the industry has become one of the issues as it relates to traffic? I know, you've priced a little less than the industry. But, I think, do you think that consumers are becoming more price-sensitive in today's economy?\nRick Cardenas: I think there might be some price sensitivity in consumers overall, whether it's in the restaurants or what have you. But you think about GDP trends, so over the last four quarters, GDP has continued to tick down and that would mean that traffic would take down everywhere. Whether it's at a restaurant or it's in a retail establishment, wherever it is, as GDP continues to tick down, you would expect traffic to tick down. Yes. The industry saw a little bit more of a hit to that. And I do believe part of that was because of the bounce-back from Omicron last year in Q4. I don't think we were the only ones that benefited from that. I think others did. And so let's see how this all plays out. We've given you our guidance for the year, which does assume negative traffic. And actually assumes less negative traffic than the industry. So that should tell you we think there is a little bit of softness there. But we're going to continue to perform and do the things that we do every day to bring guests into our restaurant.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you. First one was just on cash usage in the share repurchase as part of your long-term algorithm. I guess the midpoint going up by like $200 million. And you bumped the dividend by close to 10% and the CapEx is going up a little bit more than perhaps what you previously thought. I just wondering what's going in the other direction. And I think about in the context of M&A. I mean, I know you have returned to the market with the Ruth's acquisition. I'm wondering whether you're seeing potential for more, maybe the valuation challenges that you've previously noted have been easing. Any thoughts there would be great. And then I have one follow-up.\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. Let me talk about the cash and then I'll turn it over to Rick for the M&A commentary. So as far as cash usage, if you look at our business, we generate somewhere around $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, our guidance would imply in terms of cash -- operating cash flow. So between the dividend and the CapEx and with the share repurchase, we still would be building cash maybe at an -- if you take all the midpoints of all of those ranges we would still build a cash balance of call it may be close to $100 million. So we're really not tapping into any borrowings sort of that to meet these commitments we have embedded in here. As far as the long term framework share repurchase range, that is really to reflect the change in our share price from five years ago because we haven't updated the framework for five years. So all that change as much as it feels like it's double, that's basically reflecting that our share price has doubled during that timeframe. And so now, with that, I'll just turn it to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: I'll just add something to that. If you look at -- think about the cash flow or EBITDA, pre-COVID, our EBITDA was about $1.2 billion and today with based on Raj is saying it's $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion. So that gives us a lot more cash to do those things and increase our share buyback and M&A. And so if you think -- but we've talked about M&A often. M&A adds to our scale which is our biggest advantage. And we continue to talk to our Board, management continues to talk to the Board about our best uses of capital and M&A is one of those. And so but we just got done with the Ruth's deal. So let us do a little bit there. It doesn't mean that we wouldn't be back in the market down the road. But we've got plenty of cash, we've got plenty of debt capacity. Raj said, we're at basically two times adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDAR and that's at the low end of our range. So we have plenty of capacity to do more things.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Yeah. And then just a clarification, just wondering if you're going to provide pro-forma restated maybe Darden results for the quarters of fiscal '23 as if you owned Ruth's the entire year. I know it's tough for us to model with a different quarter and year-ends and with Ruth's operating a 50-50 company franchise model, just trying to get some color as to whether or not you'll provide any help from a modeling perspective or any pro-forma type results to give us better insight into the growth rate going forward. Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Really the fiscal calendars when you look at the quarters, we're only a month half. We don't plan on restating the history. I think -- and I also want to think about how material it is to the overall Darden P&L.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nSara Senatore: Great. Thank you. First a clarification, which is you talked about the cadence of pricing over the course of the year, is it fair to assume that you're thinking the cadence input inflation will follow suit in the sense of kind of rolling off over the course of the year or is there a reason to believe that maybe the math -- the gap between pricing and inflation might look different and therefore the implications from margins might be different over the course of the year. So that's the first question and then I'll have another one Ruth's, please.\nRaj Vennam: Hey Sara. Great question. As we think about inflation, we don't expect the cadence to be significantly different. I think we have a little bit more in the first quarter, but not a huge difference. We're talking about 50 basis points to 60 basis points may be different from quarter-to-quarter. So that 3% to 4% range is what we provided for the overall. You can expect first quarter to be closer to 4% and then the other quarters might be close -- a little bit less than that. But then, there's really not a meaningful difference between quarters. So that would imply that year-over-year, there is a little bit of delta in pricing versus inflation, because we are starting with a higher price as we get out of Q4 -- where we exited the Q4 levels. So, I know you also said you had a second question. So I'll wait for that.\nSara Senatore: Yeah. Thank you. And then actually, just to clarify on that one and then I'll ask the question, which is, is the implication that by the fourth quarter, you'll be needing to find more productivity gains or something else if you have less price but sort of level loaded inflation over the course of the year.\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. I think we do expect the gap to reverse by the time we get to the back half. In fact, the way we look at -- when we look at our quarterly earnings that are embedded in our guidance, the cadence, while it's more balanced than last year, we do see Q2 providing the highest-growth while Q4 providing the lowest from an earnings standpoint and Q1, Q3 more in line with the annual growth that we provided.\nSara Senatore: Okay. Thank you very much. And then just a question. I know Rick you said, you've only had Ruth's for eight days. But presumably, there's a lot of diligence that went ahead of that. So I know you mentioned $20 million roughly by the end of fiscal 2025 primarily coming through supply chain and G&A. If I look at the restaurant-level margins for Ruth's versus like your Fine Dining, is that -- is supply chain and cost of goods is that the primary difference as I think about the potential to bridge that gap.\nRick Cardenas: Well, we've said in the past that most of our G&A -- most of our synergies come from G&A and supply chain. So, when we have in the past that it's about half-and-half whenever we done acquisitions before. So yes, Ruth's should get in the long term benefits from cost-of-sales. Now that said, we may reinvest some of those cost-of-sales and our other brands will get some of the benefits too. So it won't all flow to Ruth's. I will say that there aren't many brands in the industry that we could acquire that actually improve our EBITDA margin at the restaurant-level and Ruth's does. So, across Darden. Now they might not be as high depending on how you look at it as Capital Grille, they might be higher, a little bit lower depending on your definition of restaurant margin. But they're pretty close. And so and because Capital Grille is higher than Darden's average margin, Ruth's helps Darden's margin. So that's a pretty good deal for us.\nSara Senatore: I see. Thank you both so much. Very helpful.\nRick Cardenas: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your questions.\nJeff Farmer: Thank you. Just following up on modeling post-Ruth acquisition, you shared some information on G&A, but anything you can share as it relates to how we should be thinking about both interest expense and G&A moving forward?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Jeff. I'd say, interest expense is likely going to be I think for a year-over-year, we're probably looking at a total of $50 million of which $40 million is related to Ruth's acquisition. And then the other is just the lease interest and other short-term interest rate exposure we have. So that's the thing on the interest. And the G&A, I would just really take into consideration the Darden's G&A and then lay it on Ruth's from what you have. There'll be some purchase accounting that we're working through. So we'll have some updates on that. But that will be more of a geography, more so than a huge impact. We've embedded some incremental step-up in our valuation and in our P&L and that's incorporated in our guidance, but we're not ready to share those details yet.\nJeff Farmer: Okay. And just one more. One of your named competitive advantages over the last several years has been this extensive data and insights. But can you share maybe one or two examples of how you were able to leverage that data in '23 and potentially some untapped opportunities as you move forward in terms of harnessing and really analyzing that data moving forward?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Jeff. This is Rick. You think about what we're starting to do with data, we are starting to use a lot of AI and machine-learning to help guest count forecast and help our restaurants forecast our business better. And that would move all the way down through the company, right. So if you forecast your traffic better, you order better, you receive better, you schedule better, that's one of the big things that we've looked at is using machine-learning and AI. But we got to remember, one of the things that we do every year as we use data to help look at what our guests patterns are, what we think about guests and how do we market to our guests. We also improve operations execution with the data that we have. But I would say, if you're asking for one big thing -- and is analytics through pricing too. So, we've got a great analytics team here that does help with our pricing. They look at restaurants, they look at categories, look at items, they look at elasticity. And we can do all that in-house because of our scale.\nJeff Farmer: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Good morning. I'm wondering what is the integration timeline that you are embedding in your EPS accretion expectations. And how is the previous acquisition of Cheddar's impacting the timeline that you are expecting and what will it take for this integration to accelerate? And I'm talking even beyond the 2024 timeline that you set today.\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Danilo, we're still working through the steps, but our expectation is a lot of the stuff happens over the next 12 months to 15 months. And so that's why some of those synergies come later because we're not trying to -- we're trying to be prudent. We're going to be thoughtful. We got to design this right, make -- do this right because we want to set it up for success long term. We're and we want to make sure we minimize the disruption to operators. And so everything we're doing, we have a great team working on it. That's actually being very thoughtfully phasing in these parts of integration and how we integrate different parts of the business. And we've learned a lot from our Cheddar's acquisition. Obviously, Cheddar's was more complicated with essentially three different businesses being brought under one roof. With Ruth's, it's not -- it shouldn't be as complicated, but a lot of the learnings we have from our prior acquisitions are incorporated into -- are actually taking into consideration as we plan for this.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Thank you. And what set of factors would prompt you to drive higher unit growth versus the data 50%? I know you mentioned more competitive bidding is actually starting to happen. But have there been any internal discussions on potentially international expansion given your recent quarter and also the recent acquisition of Ruth?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Danilo. If you think about our pipeline for this year, most of the pipeline, you have to have already started construction by the time the year -- almost by the time the year started to get them open because it takes a little longer to open a restaurant or build a restaurant today than it did before COVID. So if it's not started by the end of Q1, it probably doesn't open this year. Maybe even if it doesn't start until -- by July, it's hard to open this year. So that's why we've got our kind of guide of about 50 gross openings. When we talk about international, that doesn't incorporate -- that's not incorporated in our unit count because we are committed to staying a company-owned model only in the U.S., not that we wouldn't have franchise in the U.S., but will be only franchise outside the U.S. and Canada. So all of our restaurants outside the U.S., the ones that we opened last year were all franchised. And anything that we open going forward is likely to be franchised as well.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Perfect. Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Harbour: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. I had a question just about fine dining sales. Is that really just kind of about the lapping dynamic or could you provide any comments on kind of some of the different customer sets, whether it's business type of customers versus like a more aspirational customer, if you're seeing anything different there?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Brian. I'd say, first of all, as we said in the prepared remarks, we actually saw a fairly consistent retention related to pre-COVID for the last three quarters at fine dining. What we're seeing is we are seeing a little bit of pullback on the alcohol sales. And we still think that's also a function of wrapping on a significant increase a year ago. Now as we just generally speaking, what we're seeing with the demographics is consumers below 35 or above pre-COVID, but they're below last year. And then whereas 55-plus is still below pre-COVID, but they're similar to last year. So there's a different dynamic year-over-year where you're seeing the younger demographic pull back a little bit year-over-year. And then -- and similarly, on the income side, we're seeing that lower income is above pre-COVID but still below last -- but below last year, whereas higher income flattish to last year or similar to last year, but they are still below pre covert. So those are some of the insights I can share on fine dining.\nBrian Harbour: Okay. And then maybe just on kind of the labor line. Did you comment on what labor inflation was in the most recent quarter, it sounds like it was like mid-single-digit range. And is there any kind of like slowing in that pace assumed through the course of this year or is it going to be pretty steady or how do you kind of expect that to play out?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. Our labor did -- overall labor inflation ticked down about 100 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We were at 6% in Q4. That included wage inflation close to 7%. And -- so that's also a tick down from prior quarter, a meaningful step down. And that actually was a little bit better than we thought for the quarter. Now as we look to the future, as we said, so we ended the year with 6.9% total labor inflation and we said we expect that to step down by about 100 basis points as we go to next year. That\u2019s why we talked about that mid-single-digit inflation.\nBrian Harbour: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nDennis Geiger: Thank you. Raj, I'm just curious if there's any update to share on how you think continued margin gains longer term. I know you've spoken a bit more to the long-term total shareholder return algorithm of late. But just curious if anything new on long-term margin considerations and of 10 bps to 30 bps annually is kind of the right way to think about it still?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Dennis. We do think that 10 to 30 is the way to think about it from where we are starting this fiscal year. So that's how we restated our framework. And the only change we made is to the share repurchase because we still believe that that 10 to 30 is a good target for us to have for the foreseeable future.\nDennis Geiger: Thank you. And then just on the to-go sales across the portfolio to some extent. Sort of where you sit now? And if any kind of latest thoughts on what that could look like, either growth there, sales mix opportunities as we look to '24? Thank you very much.\nRaj Vennam: Well, so our to-go sales are actually pretty consistent with where we were in Q3. So I think we\u2019re still running at Olive Garden close to 25%, LongHorn on 14 and Cheddar at 12%, which is not that dissimilar to what we had a quarter ago. And we\u2019re doing that without third-party delivery. And we continue to see that we\u2019re able to kind of still get overall sales growth and outperformance versus the industry, while not tapping into these other channels and actually, we\u2019re managing the experience better. We feel like we have continued to execute on that. As we\u2019ve said before, this is higher than we would have expected a couple of years ago. But we\u2019re very happy with it. And our teams are focused on executing at the highest level possible to make sure that we can sustain and grow from here.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you, Raj.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. I know you have actually famously done at a brand level customer segmentation work. You used to talk about that in Analyst Day as many years ago. So I guess using that data or using your current, can you explain how you think about the upcoming repayment of student loans, something that you've been asked about today, it's coming, I think, in September, obviously, the press itself has kind of gotten smart that that's something that's coming and actually might be fairly significant change for at least some cohort of the population. Can you think of -- is there any impact to Darden specifically, have you thought through that? And what might potential responses be?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, John. Yeah. We think through that all the time. And we do still do those consumer segmentation studies, and we still do market structure studies. We don't necessarily talk about them externally because we don't want everybody else to see them. But thinking about the student loan impact, yes, they'll start being repaid in, I guess, September around there, but it shouldn't be a material headwind. It will be a headwind. Any time you take money out of consumers' pockets, it's a headwind, but it shouldn't be material because student loan payments are a very small component and it's probably already baked into the economic forecast for GDP growth that we use for our plan.\nJohn Ivankoe: And just in terms of like that specific cohort, I mean, whether it's 25 to 44, what have you. I mean I know Olive Garden historically is kind of skewed older. But is there anything that you can kind of help us with us just saying, hey, you have some big percentage of the customer base that's just not going to be affected by all. Is there a little bit more information you can kind of give us as you triangulate it? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Sure. I think Raj talked about our consumer demographics a little bit ago. We're still above pre-COVID on our consumers in the 35 age range or below 35, which is probably the ones that are in their student loan repayment period. And the 55 plus or below pre-COVID last year. So there's probably still some room for some of those 55 plus to come back, and I'm doubting that they're paying student loans back unless they're paying it for their kids. And if you think about our population, we still have a high percentage of our of our consumers that are above $100,000. So hopefully, a student loan repayment wouldn\u2019t impact them too much.\nJohn Ivankoe: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two for me. The first one is on the commodity side. I'm curious if you feel like your visibility into the food cost outlook is improving or the duration to which you have visibility is improving just as the rate of inflation is moderating here? And then the second question is on the unit growth side. You talked about the bidding side and some favorability potentially there. I'm just curious in terms of permitting supply chain equipment. Are there green shoots on that side? Or how are you seeing that evolve. Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Andrew. This is Raj. So on the commodity side, we do have better visibility today than we did a year ago. We actually have, for the first time, I think, in four years, probably have coverage that is actually pretty similar to the way we used to before COVID. I think we have \u2013 as we talked about for the first half, we have a total coverage of 65% of our basket covered and call it closer to that 25% to 30% in the back half color, which is, again, pretty much back to the levels we used to have pre-COVID. So we definitely feel like we have a lot more visibility today than we did before. And then as far as the development side, we are starting to see some signs of improvement. Rick talked earlier about some of the bids coming in better or multiple bids coming in. There\u2019s still some delays in permitting and utility connections with local agencies and stuff like that. But all that said, we do see some green shoots. We think that we believe that the inflation on the action side has peaked it\u2019s still elevated, but it\u2019s not going \u2013 continuing to go up. And in fact, I think we \u2013 the last few bids we\u2019ve had last few construction starts we\u2019ve had \u2013 they were in line with our budget or better. So just make \u2013 starting to see some positive signs there.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Vaccaro: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to circle back on the strength at LongHorn -- it seems like the brand took another step up at least through the lens of average weekly sales volumes, which I think are now up in the mid-30s versus pre-COVID levels. I know the brain has gained a lot of share through the pandemic, but anything incremental worth highlighting that you think is driving this incremental uptick?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Brian. LongHorn has been executing well for the last few years. And I keep -- I want to comment Todd and his team, they've been on this journey in quality, simplicity and culture. That's what Todd talks about every day, investing in quality and portions that continue to pay off. They had almost 7.1% same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter. That was driven by some pricing. They've had more inflation, but they also have had record weekly sales and Mother's Day, and yes, they're 34% above pre-COVID levels in sales versus Q4. And traffic is positive over pre-COVID. So I can't tell you it's any silver bullet and we've talked about that in the past that there aren't silver bullets here. It's about having great execution, investing in your team, investing in your product to drive profitable same-restaurant sales growth. And that's what they've been doing.\nBrian Vaccaro: All right. And then I also just wanted to circle back on the Roots acquisition and your customer segmentation work. Could you elaborate a little bit on the overlap or maybe more interestingly, the key differences between Roots customer base versus your other fine dining brands or any other differences you think are worth highlighting regarding the brand?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Brian. Let me talk about differences and why we believe that there\u2019s not a whole \u2013 a lot of overlap between the Ruth\u2019s customer and a capital growth customer. But I will preface this by saying, we\u2019ve only owned them for 8 days. And before we closed the deal, we were not allowed to see their consumer data, right? We were still competitors, and we couldn\u2019t see their consumer data other than looking at third-party data that we would have. So we want to start looking at their data to understand it a little bit better. But one of the primary reasons is geography. If you look at \u2013 they have 150-ish restaurants, including the franchise system, and they have restaurants in markets that Capital Grille doesn\u2019t have restaurants in. And even in restaurants to capital, even in markets that Capital Grille has restaurants in, they\u2019re not necessarily close to each other in a lot of those markets. So there isn\u2019t as much overlap as you would expect. And that\u2019s a good thing for us, good thing for Ruth Chris, and it\u2019s a good thing for Capital Grille. And \u2013 but then I would add that if you think about ADBs and Capital Grille, we\u2019ve had this kind of scenario for many years. Where ADBs guests may go to Capital Grille, but they go for different occasions. And we want to learn a little bit about that at routes on the occasion differences. And then finally, I think Capital Grille is a little bit more, going back to geography, a little bit more mix in urban than Roots, an urban core versus Ruth Chris, where Ruth Chris, for example, if you have a restaurant in Birmingham, we don\u2019t have \u2013 or in Destin, Florida. There\u2019s the Ruth Chris. We don\u2019t have Capital Grille there. So there\u2019s reasons that there isn\u2019t as much overlap as you would have thought.\nBrian Vaccaro: All right. That\u2019s great. I\u2019ll pass it along. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Mine was on labor productivity. You mentioned that you expect some labor productivity improvements in '24, but not a whole lot. I guess my question is around turnover. I would have thought that just the improving labor environment, staffing is kind of, I think, back to pre-COVID levels, but turnover going down, so productivity should be going way up. In terms of -- at your brands, have you already benefited? I mean, I guess, maybe was your turnover not so bad before that's why you're not going to get much of an incremental benefit. If you could just talk about how the labor dynamics and what that could or couldn't do to labor productivity.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Jake. Yes, you would expect that as turnover goes down, productivity gets better, and we've started to see that already this year. So our turnover is improving and our productivity is getting better. So it's not like we're going from the highest turnover we've ever had to the lower turnover next year. We've actually started gradually moving to it. And one of the places that gets you the biggest productivity loss is the turnover in the first 90 days. And that's had a very big improvement for us. So you don't -- you have less productivity loss if you have less 90-day turnover. And so we've seen an improvement in turnover. We're still above pre-COVID levels, but we're a lot closer to our pre-COVID levels than we were just last month and the last month before that, the month before that. And we'll continue to improve I don't know if we'll ever get back to pre-COVID level turnovers. But if we do, then that should give us even more productivity enhancements.\nJake Bartlett: Great. And then I have a follow-up on unit growth and you gave guidance for 2024. A couple of years ago, you had mentioned your expectations kind of moved towards the higher end of the range. So closer to 3% from the 2% to 3% range. Is that still valid kind of going forward, and it's going to be lower in '24, but longer term, should we think of the higher end of the range is the right point or are we kind of getting back into maybe the middle of the range longer term?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Jake. Our goal is still to get towards the higher end of the range. It might take us a little bit more time to get there than we originally thought. COVID has slowed a lot of stuff down in development. The permitting that Raj talked about, equipment that Raj talked about, those things are getting better than all the way back. It would be great if we could get permits as fast as we used to get them. It would be great if we can get utilities turn down as fast as we used to get them. That's just not come back anywhere near where we need it to be. And as we think about construction costs, getting back to a more normal level, Raj mentioned that we've had the last few contracts that we've bid out have come in better than what we expected. And that's a good sign for us. So that will help us get back to that higher end of our framework. And I would also remember, we don't talk about this very much, but that framework includes M&A. And while we would like to get to the high end of the framework just with organic growth, M&A is prime work. And the thing is when we shared that framework earlier today, the five year delta, the five year impact to the framework, had no M&A in it. And we were still within our -- within probably the mid-range of our unit growth. So M&A is part of that. It is part of our capital allocation. So -- but we would still like to get to the high end without M&A.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Park with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Parke: Hey. Good morning. I guess as we think about the segment profitability into '24, are there any segments that you guys see as outliers either in terms of improvement or pressure that you are expecting?\nRaj Vennam: Well, I think it's fair to affect that, that as we talked about, fine dining is going to have a tough ramp in the first quarter. So -- but as far as we think about year-over-year, we expect all our segments to get a little bit better. That's kind of how we plan the year, and that's what we push our teams to do.\nJohn Parke: Got it. And then kind of just on the pricing side, so I guess in the beef inflation that you're seeing, is it fair to assume the LongHorn and find I think pricing is above that range and Olive Garden [indiscernible] is below?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. That\u2019s a fair assumption.\nJohn Parke: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your questions.\nGregory Francfort: Hey. Thank you. I just have two quick follow-up on labor. The first is, I guess, within that 5% labor inflation that you're expecting, how much of that's going to be statutory this year? And how much of it maybe still market pressure. And then maybe a correlated question is, as you guys are going out there at a higher new work is you're talking about turnover, the wage that it costs to hire somebody new today -- have you seen a break in that or a material break in that wage? I'm just curious as I think about how much easier it's not for you guys to hire people. Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Greg. So just let me start by clarifying. We did not say it's 5%. We said mid-single digits, and I want to make sure that it's not treated as a 5%. I think our plan actually assumes a little bit north of that, but our guidance range embeds something closer to that 6% for wage inflation. So I just want to clarify that. And then as far as the regulatory piece, the minimum wage impact, that's about just under 2%, I think, for the full year, maybe 1.5% to 2% is what we have there. And then beyond that, it's just the normal merit increases and other stuff. Now as far as the comment -- the question around wages and, clearly, the environment has gotten a lot better, we are doing a lot fewer out-of-cycle adjustments than we were doing even six months ago. So from that perspective, there is clearly a lot of, I would say, for lack of a better term, positive science in hiring environment, in the starting wages, all those things getting a lot better than where a couple of quarters ago.\nRick Cardenas: And if I can just add one thing to that. If you think about our turnover coming down, that means we don\u2019t have as many people we\u2019re hiring as we were before. So we didn\u2019t have to hire as many people now than we did before. And so the wage, even if the wage break didn\u2019t happen, it\u2019s still not as big a deal for us, but the wage break is starting to happen. But the fact that we don\u2019t have to hire as many people helps us as well.\nGregory Francfort: Awesome. Thank you, guys for the perspective. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Kevin Kalicak for closing remarks.\nKevin Kalicak: Thanks. That concludes our call for today. I\u2019d like to remind you that we plan to release our first quarter results on Thursday, September 21, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks again for participating in today\u2019s call, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Raj Vennam",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the fourth quarter were $2.8 billion, 6.4% higher than last year, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4% and the addition of 47 net new restaurants. Our same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 470 basis points and same restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 540 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 15.2% from last year to $2.58. We generated $472 million in EBITDA and returned $183 million to shareholders. Total inflation slowed meaningfully this quarter to 4.4%, 270 basis points less than the third quarter, while the rate of pricing decreased from last quarter to 5.9%. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 30 basis points better driven by pricing above commodities inflation of roughly 3%. Chicken and seafood experienced deflation this quarter, helping offset high-single digit beef and beat inflation. Restaurant labor was 40 basis points better driven by productivity improvements. Restaurant expenses were 30 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage. Marketing expense was 1% of sales, consistent with our expectations and 30 basis points higher than last year. This all resulted in restaurant level EBITDA improving 80 basis points to 20.7%. Our general and administrative expenses were 40 basis points higher than last year, driven by the timing of our incentive compensation accrual as well as unfavorable year-over-year mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. Due to the way we hedge this expense, this unfavorability is largely offset on the tax line. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.4% and we generated $316 million in earnings from continuing operations, which was 11.4% of sales. Looking at our segments. Olive Garden, LongHorn and our other segment increased same-restaurant sales by 4.4%, 7.1% and 2.2%, respectively, each significantly outperformed the industry benchmark. The strong same restaurant sales performance drove segment profit margin at each of these segments higher than last year, especially at LongHorn, where segment profit margin of 18.6% was 70 basis points higher than last year. Same restaurant sales at our Fine Dining segment decreased by 1.9%, still outperforming the Black Box fine dining benchmark, excluding Darden, by more than 200 basis points. This resulted in segment profit margin below last year at the Fine Dining segment. This year-over-year sales decline was more the result of a wrapping on resurgence of demand in the fourth quarter of last year, which drove traffic retention to 108% of pre-COVID levels. Looking at traffic retention trends over the past three quarters, Fine Dining has been consistently between 101% to 102% of pre-COVID levels. We expect continued year-over-year traffic softness in our Fine Dining segment as we wrap on the first quarter traffic in fiscal 2023 that was at 107% of pre-COVID traffic levels. We expect traffic to stabilize on a year-over-year basis after the first quarter. As we look at our annual results for fiscal 2023, we had strong same-restaurant sales of 6.8% which outperformed the industry by 410 basis points and our same-restaurant traffic was 510 basis points above the industry. The strong top line performance drove $1.6 billion in EBITDA from continuing operations. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders and ended the year with $368 million of cash. Looking at our fiscal 2023 full year results compared to pre-COVID, operating income margins have grown 140 basis points. Food and beverage as percent of sales increased 380 basis points driven by investments in food quality and pricing well below commodities inflation. Offsetting this unfavorability were improvements in labor productivity, reduced restaurant and marketing expenses and G&A efficiencies. Our strong operating model generates significant and durable cash flows. Since 2018 we have delivered approximately 8% annualized EBITDA growth. At the end of fiscal 2023, our balance sheet was well-positioned at just 1.8 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR well below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times. And when we look at our performance compared to our long-term framework over the last five years, we've been achieved -- we've been able to achieve annualized total shareholder returns of 14.2% as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield. This is near the high end of our target and was driven by annualized earnings after tax growth of 10.2% above the high end of our framework. Cash returns were 4% which is at the middle of our framework. As we look to the future, we still believe that over time our 10% to 15% target for total shareholder returns is appropriate. However, we're increasing the share repurchase range to better reflect the impact of our share price appreciation since we last updated the framework five years ago. The updated share repurchase range is $300 million to $500 million. Before we get into our outlook for fiscal 2024, I want to provide an update on the acquisition of Ruth's Chris which we completed last week. This was financed through a $600 million term loan and cash on our balance sheet, bringing our adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR to approximately 2 times. As we move forward into 2024, sales and profits from Ruth's Chris company-owned and operated locations will be included in our Fine Dining segment, while revenues and profits from the franchise locations will reside in our other segment, consistent with the treatment of our existing franchise locations. However, Fine Dining same-restaurant sales results will not include Ruth's Chris until they have been owned and operated by us for a period of 16 months. As we mentioned in our conference call in early May, we expect to achieve run rate synergies of approximately $20 million by the end of fiscal 2025 primarily through supply chain and G&A savings. We also expect Ruth's Chris will be accretive to our earnings per share by approximately $0.10 to $0.12 in fiscal 2024 and $0.20 to $0.25 in fiscal 2025. We anticipate total acquisition and integration-related expense of approximately $55 million pre-tax. Now turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024 which includes Ruth's Chris operating results, but excludes the aforementioned acquisition and integration related expense. We expect total sales of $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion driven by the addition of Ruth's Chris store portfolio, same-restaurant sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and approximately 50 gross new restaurant openings, including four relocations. Capital spending of $550 million to $600 million, total inflation of approximately 3% to 4% which includes commodities inflation of approximately 2.5% driven primarily by beef and produce, while most other categories are flat to deflationary and hourly labor inflation in the mid-single digits. And annual effective tax-rate of approximately 12% to 12.5% and approximately 121.5 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $8.55 and $8.85. And finally, our Board approved an 8% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.31 per share, implying an annual dividend of $5.24. And with that, I will turn it back to Rick. Yeah, Chris. I think, look, we're taking into consideration all the information we have, right. We think -- we build a plan based on all the information we have today. And if you look at what the consensus economic forecast is for the next year, it's flattish GDP and that -- in a -- if you look at last year where GDP was growing, the industry will still had negative traffic, right? So while we outperformed quite a bit and we expect to continue to outperform, we're taking that into consideration as we build a plan. But if you look at the midpoint of our guide, you do get to a decent base business growth and that's kind of how we build a plan and then the guidance range is to incorporate some variability around that and that's how we really think about it. Yeah. Well, I would say that it's not softening today. I mean if you look at the last few weeks, I think we're -- our GAAP to industry sale is fairly similar. But as we talked about, Q1, we do expect some softness in Fine Dining, that's just a function of wrap. But outside of that, no, we're not seeing any trends that would -- any recent trends that would indicate that there is a major change in the underlying environment for us. Yeah, Eric. So the way we think about it is, our comp guidance of 2.5% to 3.5%, we expect to have pricing in the 3.5% to 4%, which would imply a traffic of flat to negative 1.5% for the year for us. That range would imply that. You can extrapolate from that what the implied industry can be. We're not expecting our GAAP to be significantly different going into the year, but we focus a lot more on things we can control. And we look at all the factors we have year-over-year and taking into consideration the macroenvironment and then just build a plan that way. As far as comp -- exiting the pricing, yeah, we exited the quarter with closer to 6% as we said and but we expect that to tick down throughout the year. So start with that, call it, 6%, but by the end of the year, by Q4, we get closer to the 2%. Now, lot of the pricing actions we took last year already impact next year's by about 3%. So the carryover from prior year is probably close to 3% and so that's really where we are. Yeah, Brian. I think the way we look at it is, if you look at our framework or actually even excluding Ruth's -- the middle of the guidance for Ruth's is at $0.11 accretion. If you take that out, we're still in that -- a TSR that's north of 10% at the middle of -- at the middle of the guidance range. Now, one of the things I want to point out is, we haven't been able to buy back shares for almost three months now, because of trading blackout. And so that has an impact on EPS for next year. But even with that, like as we said, we still get to that double-digit TSR when you incorporate the dividend yield and the EPS growth. Yeah, Brian. It's really labor. I expect the hourly wage inflation to be in that call it mid-single digits. And then their salary to be also closer to that. And some of that is a function of how we choose to pay our people. We are -- our merit increases have been above the industry and we think that's prudent. We want to continue to do that. And that's the type of investment we make to help us sustain the types of performance that we've been able to deliver. You look at a 400 basis point, 500 basis point gap to the industry that doesn't happen, magically. They are lot of things that go into that. And we are very thoughtful about how we make those decisions. Yeah. The way we're thinking about -- in terms of how we build the plan is that we expect retentions levels to be fairly similar to moderate a little bit relative to pre-COVID from where we were this fiscal year. So not a significant drop-off, but a little bit. But then, I think from a same-restaurant sales perspective, it's going to be driven by the pricing differences. The fact that we're going to start off with the higher price and then the price moderates down to -- the rate of pricing goes down to 2% by -- closer to 2% by Q4. That will have an impact on same-restaurant sales. As we think about guest counts, as I mentioned, the retention, we expect it to be fairly consistent quarter-to-quarter relative to last year. We basically are assuming somewhere in that 10 basis points to 20 basis points more than what we spent last year in total marketing. So that's kind of not that different from what we did in fiscal '23. Yeah. I think -- so, especially with Ruth's coming in, you should -- we ended the fiscal year with closer to $390 million. I'd say at this point, our best estimate is probably still maintaining closer to that 3.7% of total sales, which would get you closer to the call it $430 million for the year. Obviously, plus or minus 10 there. But that would be the number we would -- that is embedded in our guidance. Yeah. Hey. By the way, as we talk about G&A, I just want to clarify one other thing. We do expect the cadence to be a little different. So, Q1 is probably going to be the highest level, call it closer to $115 million and then kind of tick down $5 million a quarter throughout the -- for the next few quarters. It's how we think about it just from a cadence standpoint. So there are some things that -- sudden specific variables that are influencing Q1 to be higher. Yeah. I would say the way we're thinking about it is our core casual brands are probably closer to the -- I guess, let's just go through the big brands. Olive Garden is probably -- would be in the middle of the range is our expectation going in. And then LongHorn would be outside of that range to the upside primarily because of stake inflation and the pricing there is probably a little bit higher, would need to be. And then Fine Dining to be a little bit south of that. And that's really how we're thinking about it. Yeah. Let me talk about the cash and then I'll turn it over to Rick for the M&A commentary. So as far as cash usage, if you look at our business, we generate somewhere around $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, our guidance would imply in terms of cash -- operating cash flow. So between the dividend and the CapEx and with the share repurchase, we still would be building cash maybe at an -- if you take all the midpoints of all of those ranges we would still build a cash balance of call it may be close to $100 million. So we're really not tapping into any borrowings sort of that to meet these commitments we have embedded in here. As far as the long term framework share repurchase range, that is really to reflect the change in our share price from five years ago because we haven't updated the framework for five years. So all that change as much as it feels like it's double, that's basically reflecting that our share price has doubled during that timeframe. And so now, with that, I'll just turn it to Rick. Really the fiscal calendars when you look at the quarters, we're only a month half. We don't plan on restating the history. I think -- and I also want to think about how material it is to the overall Darden P&L. Hey Sara. Great question. As we think about inflation, we don't expect the cadence to be significantly different. I think we have a little bit more in the first quarter, but not a huge difference. We're talking about 50 basis points to 60 basis points may be different from quarter-to-quarter. So that 3% to 4% range is what we provided for the overall. You can expect first quarter to be closer to 4% and then the other quarters might be close -- a little bit less than that. But then, there's really not a meaningful difference between quarters. So that would imply that year-over-year, there is a little bit of delta in pricing versus inflation, because we are starting with a higher price as we get out of Q4 -- where we exited the Q4 levels. So, I know you also said you had a second question. So I'll wait for that. Yeah. I think we do expect the gap to reverse by the time we get to the back half. In fact, the way we look at -- when we look at our quarterly earnings that are embedded in our guidance, the cadence, while it's more balanced than last year, we do see Q2 providing the highest-growth while Q4 providing the lowest from an earnings standpoint and Q1, Q3 more in line with the annual growth that we provided. Yeah, Jeff. I'd say, interest expense is likely going to be I think for a year-over-year, we're probably looking at a total of $50 million of which $40 million is related to Ruth's acquisition. And then the other is just the lease interest and other short-term interest rate exposure we have. So that's the thing on the interest. And the G&A, I would just really take into consideration the Darden's G&A and then lay it on Ruth's from what you have. There'll be some purchase accounting that we're working through. So we'll have some updates on that. But that will be more of a geography, more so than a huge impact. We've embedded some incremental step-up in our valuation and in our P&L and that's incorporated in our guidance, but we're not ready to share those details yet. Hey, Danilo, we're still working through the steps, but our expectation is a lot of the stuff happens over the next 12 months to 15 months. And so that's why some of those synergies come later because we're not trying to -- we're trying to be prudent. We're going to be thoughtful. We got to design this right, make -- do this right because we want to set it up for success long term. We're and we want to make sure we minimize the disruption to operators. And so everything we're doing, we have a great team working on it. That's actually being very thoughtfully phasing in these parts of integration and how we integrate different parts of the business. And we've learned a lot from our Cheddar's acquisition. Obviously, Cheddar's was more complicated with essentially three different businesses being brought under one roof. With Ruth's, it's not -- it shouldn't be as complicated, but a lot of the learnings we have from our prior acquisitions are incorporated into -- are actually taking into consideration as we plan for this. Yeah, Brian. I'd say, first of all, as we said in the prepared remarks, we actually saw a fairly consistent retention related to pre-COVID for the last three quarters at fine dining. What we're seeing is we are seeing a little bit of pullback on the alcohol sales. And we still think that's also a function of wrapping on a significant increase a year ago. Now as we just generally speaking, what we're seeing with the demographics is consumers below 35 or above pre-COVID, but they're below last year. And then whereas 55-plus is still below pre-COVID, but they're similar to last year. So there's a different dynamic year-over-year where you're seeing the younger demographic pull back a little bit year-over-year. And then -- and similarly, on the income side, we're seeing that lower income is above pre-COVID but still below last -- but below last year, whereas higher income flattish to last year or similar to last year, but they are still below pre covert. So those are some of the insights I can share on fine dining. Yeah. Our labor did -- overall labor inflation ticked down about 100 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We were at 6% in Q4. That included wage inflation close to 7%. And -- so that's also a tick down from prior quarter, a meaningful step down. And that actually was a little bit better than we thought for the quarter. Now as we look to the future, as we said, so we ended the year with 6.9% total labor inflation and we said we expect that to step down by about 100 basis points as we go to next year. That's why we talked about that mid-single-digit inflation. Yes, Dennis. We do think that 10 to 30 is the way to think about it from where we are starting this fiscal year. So that's how we restated our framework. And the only change we made is to the share repurchase because we still believe that that 10 to 30 is a good target for us to have for the foreseeable future. Well, so our to-go sales are actually pretty consistent with where we were in Q3. So I think we're still running at Olive Garden close to 25%, LongHorn on 14 and Cheddar at 12%, which is not that dissimilar to what we had a quarter ago. And we're doing that without third-party delivery. And we continue to see that we're able to kind of still get overall sales growth and outperformance versus the industry, while not tapping into these other channels and actually, we're managing the experience better. We feel like we have continued to execute on that. As we've said before, this is higher than we would have expected a couple of years ago. But we're very happy with it. And our teams are focused on executing at the highest level possible to make sure that we can sustain and grow from here. Hey, Andrew. This is Raj. So on the commodity side, we do have better visibility today than we did a year ago. We actually have, for the first time, I think, in four years, probably have coverage that is actually pretty similar to the way we used to before COVID. I think we have \u2013 as we talked about for the first half, we have a total coverage of 65% of our basket covered and call it closer to that 25% to 30% in the back half color, which is, again, pretty much back to the levels we used to have pre-COVID. So we definitely feel like we have a lot more visibility today than we did before. And then as far as the development side, we are starting to see some signs of improvement. Rick talked earlier about some of the bids coming in better or multiple bids coming in. There's still some delays in permitting and utility connections with local agencies and stuff like that. But all that said, we do see some green shoots. We think that we believe that the inflation on the action side has peaked it's still elevated, but it's not going \u2013 continuing to go up. And in fact, I think we \u2013 the last few bids we've had last few construction starts we've had \u2013 they were in line with our budget or better. So just make \u2013 starting to see some positive signs there. Well, I think it's fair to affect that, that as we talked about, fine dining is going to have a tough ramp in the first quarter. So -- but as far as we think about year-over-year, we expect all our segments to get a little bit better. That's kind of how we plan the year, and that's what we push our teams to do. Yeah. That's a fair assumption. Hey, Greg. So just let me start by clarifying. We did not say it's 5%. We said mid-single digits, and I want to make sure that it's not treated as a 5%. I think our plan actually assumes a little bit north of that, but our guidance range embeds something closer to that 6% for wage inflation. So I just want to clarify that. And then as far as the regulatory piece, the minimum wage impact, that's about just under 2%, I think, for the full year, maybe 1.5% to 2% is what we have there. And then beyond that, it's just the normal merit increases and other stuff. Now as far as the comment -- the question around wages and, clearly, the environment has gotten a lot better, we are doing a lot fewer out-of-cycle adjustments than we were doing even six months ago. So from that perspective, there is clearly a lot of, I would say, for lack of a better term, positive science in hiring environment, in the starting wages, all those things getting a lot better than where a couple of quarters ago."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid quarter to conclude what was a very strong year. Despite a tough environment, we significantly outperformed the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales and traffic and met or exceeded the financial outlook we provided at the outset of the year. For the full fiscal year, we grew sales by 8.9% to $10.5 billion, delivered diluted net earnings per share of $8 and opened 57 new restaurants. We also opened nine new international franchise restaurants in six different countries, which is the most we've ever opened in a fiscal year. The market responded positively to our performance, leading to a total shareholder return of 32.6% for the fiscal year. We have consistently delivered strong long-term shareholder returns. In fact, since Darden was spun off from General Mills 28 years ago, a period which spans multiple business cycles, the company has achieved an annualized TSR of 10% or greater over any 10 fiscal year period. Our restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level by remaining focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere. Our brand's ongoing efforts to drive execution through simplification enable our restaurant teams to create great guest experiences as evidenced by a record-level performance we saw from many of our brands on key holidays throughout the year. Nowhere is it more apparent than at Olive Garden, which achieved the highest sales day and sales week in their history during the week of Mother's Day. This focus on being brilliant [4:33] with the basics leads to strong guest satisfaction scores and our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain at or near all-time highs across our brands. At LongHorn Steakhouse, one of their most important metrics is their steaks grilled correctly score which is at an all-time high. To continue to drive these results, LongHorn recently completed their sixth Stake Master Series, which is their annual grilling competition and training program. Over the course of two months, thousands of culinary team members competed in this highly engaging training program for the right to be crowned champion and receive the $15,000 grand price. Congratulations to this year's Steak Masters champion, Kylie Hall from the LongHorn Steakhouse in Farragut, Tennessee. I am particularly proud of everything the teams in our restaurants and at the support center accomplished in fiscal 2023. For example, Olive Garden successfully introduced Never-Ending Pasta Bowl, which leveraged their iconic brand equity, was much simpler to execute and significantly improved margin while still providing tremendous value for their guests. Throughout the year, several of our brands ranked number one among major casual dining brands in key measurement categories within Technomic's industry tracking tool including LongHorn for food quality and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for value. And several of our brands were recognized as industry leaders in employment practices by Black Box Intelligence. Olive Garden, The Capital Grille and Seasons 52 were honored with the Employer of Choice Award and LongHorn and Eddie V's received the Best Practices Award. Throughout fiscal 2023, our strategy served us well. In addition to our back-to-basics operating philosophy, driving strong execution in our restaurants, Darden's four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and results oriented culture enabled our brands to compete more effectively and provide even greater value to their guests. Our significant scale allowed our teams to successfully manage through the highly unpredictable inflationary environment, while continuing to under price inflation over the long-term. All four of our advantages are unmatched within the restaurant full-service industry. These advantages are leveraged by our portfolio of iconic brands, all generating high average unit volumes with extensive geographic footprints. Our strategy is the right one for our company and our advantages were further strengthened last week with the completion of the acquisition of Ruth's Chris Steak House. Ruth's Chris enhances our scale advantage, fits our culture and complements our portfolio of iconic brands. We are so thrilled to add such an outstanding brand and high-caliber talent. And our experienced team is working hard to integrate Ruth's Chris into Darden with as little disruption as possible. I am proud of the results we achieved in fiscal 2023, and we will continue to execute our strategy to drive growth and long-term shareholder value. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Thanks, Raj. All of us at Darden continue to work together in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. During the year, we served more than 410 million guests. We also promoted nearly 1,300 hourly team members into our manager in training program and promoted 320 managers to General Manager or Managing Partner positions. And we continue to invest in our team members' development with new programs like Fast Fluency, which allows them to learn English for free. And our Next Course scholarship program that awarded post-secondary education scholarships worth $3,000 each to nearly 100 children or dependents of Darden team members. We also remain committed to nourishing and delighting the communities we serve through our ongoing efforts to fight hunger. As part of our Darden Harvest food donation program, our restaurants donated 4.4 million meals to local food banks in fiscal 2023. We also continued our successful partnership with Feeding America with another $2 million donation from the Darden Foundation that helped provide mobile food trucks to 10 different Feeding America food banks, bringing the total to 25 food banks across the country. The addition of Ruth's Chris gives us the opportunity to nourish and delight even more guests, more team members and more communities. As I said earlier, they are an excellent addition to our portfolio. And I want to welcome, Cheryl Henry and the nearly 5,000 team members from Ruth's Chris. We are excited that you are now officially part of the Darden family. I also want to thank our team members in our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout the year. We are fortunate to have the best people in the industry and I am proud of their commitment to caring for our guests and each other. Now, we'll take your questions. Hey, Jon. This is Rick. I mean as we've talked about the choppiness of Q4, it was really fine dining going up against last year's very strong bounce back from Omicron. And so this quarter, as we alluded to at the end of -- in the third quarter, was this quarter is going be a little bit tougher for fine dining because of how they bounced back. And actually, Raj already alluded to the Q1, will probably be the same kind of toughness because of the bounce back last year. But that said, the consumer seems pretty strong overall. And within the restaurant industry and based on our internal and external data sources, there appears to be only minimal switching between lower priced occasions at this point. Not all that is switching, but some. And overall, we're not seeing anything concerning. What I will say, as you think about mix, we've talked about this before, we're not seeing material changes in our check trends across our core casual brands. There is no negative mix at Cheddar's. And we are watching add-ons and trying to understand if there is some cracks there. But we don't see any real cracks there. And -- but one area we're seeing a little bit of check management is with alcohol sales primarily at our higher end brands. And we think part of this is because of the function of last year, similar to the guest count trends we saw in last year, there was probably a little bit of euphoria in check last year. So that's kind of where we think about the consumer. And we didn't really think the quarter was choppy. We expected that to happen and that's what happened. Yeah. I think it's not necessarily integration of Ruth's. You think about what we're seeing on openings, CapEx was higher and where we wanted to be prudent as Raj said in the last call, we want to be prudent and making sure that we are earning a return that we really want to earn in our restaurants. And we've had some contractor starting to come back in and bid for sites that they stopped bidding for during the pandemic and even after the pandemic which should make bidding more competitive. We're starting to see that. And so we wanted to be prudent and make sure that we have the right returns and we still have great returns in all of our restaurants and that's kind of where it is. It's not really because of risks. Hey, Eric, this is Rick. We look at what the competitor is doing. And you're seeing some promotional activity in competitors. We've got one major competitor that launched a little bit more TV or jumped back on to TV. But that said, our strategy remains the same on the marketing side. We're going to continue to be -- to have advertising Olive Garden because it's a big competitive advantage for Olive Garden, but we're going to continue to use our filters, first, elevating brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life, it's simple to execute and it's not at a deep discount. So as we talked about in the last call, we're going to stick to our strategy of core guest count growth. We'll react accordingly if something really changes. But when we increase our marketing spend, if we do, we expect it to earn a return. So we don't necessarily expect us to go back into the deep discount craze and that's our strategy and we're going to try to stick to it. Hey, Andrew. For competitive reasons, we're definitely not going to talk about plan details. We do believe the Never Ending Pasta Bowl is a really strong promotion for us, especially with the changes we made last year. And so we'll look at any PB and if there's things that we can do with it. But definitely not going to talk about if we're going to do it twice. Yeah, Chris. As we've said before, over the last years, our brands have done a great job improving productivity. We would expect to continue to have some productivity improvements over time, but not to the extent that we had during COVID. As we continue to look at improving training, having turnover come down, that should help productivity little bit. We're not going to have to discuss Ruth's right now. We've only owned them for eight days. So we'll have to just get through the -- getting through integration is going to actually probably be a productivity downer for them for a little bit. So let's let us get Ruth's under our belt for a little bit longer than eight days before we talk about the details there. But as I said, labor productivity, we should expect it to tick better as the year progresses as we continue to improve on our turnover and as we continue to improve our training. Yeah, David. Thanks for the question. I did say earlier that we have not seen an impact in the consumer as much as maybe our competitors have. And I think there's a couple of reasons for that. There is a tension between what people want and what they can afford. And even in a slowing economy, consumers really continue to seek value. And it's not always about low prices, it's about execution, it's about what the experience to get in the restaurant or wherever they are. They're making spending tradeoffs. And as I said before, food away-from-home is really difficult to give up if you're executing. And so what we think about it is, what it means to our brands. What it means to what we do every day. And we believe that operators that can deliver on their brand promise and the value that appeals to guests, despite economic challenges, is what's going to get you to win. And that's what we've been doing. So whatever has been happening to the consumer and the economy and the restaurant space, we're going to control what we can control and what we can control is the experience that our consumers get in the restaurants every day and the value we provide. And we continue to hope that we're going to buck the trend of guest counts that the industry has. And we would expect to have a gap to the industry. I think there might be some price sensitivity in consumers overall, whether it's in the restaurants or what have you. But you think about GDP trends, so over the last four quarters, GDP has continued to tick down and that would mean that traffic would take down everywhere. Whether it's at a restaurant or it's in a retail establishment, wherever it is, as GDP continues to tick down, you would expect traffic to tick down. Yes. The industry saw a little bit more of a hit to that. And I do believe part of that was because of the bounce-back from Omicron last year in Q4. I don't think we were the only ones that benefited from that. I think others did. And so let's see how this all plays out. We've given you our guidance for the year, which does assume negative traffic. And actually assumes less negative traffic than the industry. So that should tell you we think there is a little bit of softness there. But we're going to continue to perform and do the things that we do every day to bring guests into our restaurant. Thanks. I'll just add something to that. If you look at -- think about the cash flow or EBITDA, pre-COVID, our EBITDA was about $1.2 billion and today with based on Raj is saying it's $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion. So that gives us a lot more cash to do those things and increase our share buyback and M&A. And so if you think -- but we've talked about M&A often. M&A adds to our scale which is our biggest advantage. And we continue to talk to our Board, management continues to talk to the Board about our best uses of capital and M&A is one of those. And so but we just got done with the Ruth's deal. So let us do a little bit there. It doesn't mean that we wouldn't be back in the market down the road. But we've got plenty of cash, we've got plenty of debt capacity. Raj said, we're at basically two times adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBITDAR and that's at the low end of our range. So we have plenty of capacity to do more things. Well, we've said in the past that most of our G&A -- most of our synergies come from G&A and supply chain. So, when we have in the past that it's about half-and-half whenever we done acquisitions before. So yes, Ruth's should get in the long term benefits from cost-of-sales. Now that said, we may reinvest some of those cost-of-sales and our other brands will get some of the benefits too. So it won't all flow to Ruth's. I will say that there aren't many brands in the industry that we could acquire that actually improve our EBITDA margin at the restaurant-level and Ruth's does. So, across Darden. Now they might not be as high depending on how you look at it as Capital Grille, they might be higher, a little bit lower depending on your definition of restaurant margin. But they're pretty close. And so and because Capital Grille is higher than Darden's average margin, Ruth's helps Darden's margin. So that's a pretty good deal for us. Sure. Yeah, Jeff. This is Rick. You think about what we're starting to do with data, we are starting to use a lot of AI and machine-learning to help guest count forecast and help our restaurants forecast our business better. And that would move all the way down through the company, right. So if you forecast your traffic better, you order better, you receive better, you schedule better, that's one of the big things that we've looked at is using machine-learning and AI. But we got to remember, one of the things that we do every year as we use data to help look at what our guests patterns are, what we think about guests and how do we market to our guests. We also improve operations execution with the data that we have. But I would say, if you're asking for one big thing -- and is analytics through pricing too. So, we've got a great analytics team here that does help with our pricing. They look at restaurants, they look at categories, look at items, they look at elasticity. And we can do all that in-house because of our scale. Hey, Danilo. If you think about our pipeline for this year, most of the pipeline, you have to have already started construction by the time the year -- almost by the time the year started to get them open because it takes a little longer to open a restaurant or build a restaurant today than it did before COVID. So if it's not started by the end of Q1, it probably doesn't open this year. Maybe even if it doesn't start until -- by July, it's hard to open this year. So that's why we've got our kind of guide of about 50 gross openings. When we talk about international, that doesn't incorporate -- that's not incorporated in our unit count because we are committed to staying a company-owned model only in the U.S., not that we wouldn't have franchise in the U.S., but will be only franchise outside the U.S. and Canada. So all of our restaurants outside the U.S., the ones that we opened last year were all franchised. And anything that we open going forward is likely to be franchised as well. Yeah. Hey, John. Yeah. We think through that all the time. And we do still do those consumer segmentation studies, and we still do market structure studies. We don't necessarily talk about them externally because we don't want everybody else to see them. But thinking about the student loan impact, yes, they'll start being repaid in, I guess, September around there, but it shouldn't be a material headwind. It will be a headwind. Any time you take money out of consumers' pockets, it's a headwind, but it shouldn't be material because student loan payments are a very small component and it's probably already baked into the economic forecast for GDP growth that we use for our plan. Sure. I think Raj talked about our consumer demographics a little bit ago. We're still above pre-COVID on our consumers in the 35 age range or below 35, which is probably the ones that are in their student loan repayment period. And the 55 plus or below pre-COVID last year. So there's probably still some room for some of those 55 plus to come back, and I'm doubting that they're paying student loans back unless they're paying it for their kids. And if you think about our population, we still have a high percentage of our of our consumers that are above $100,000. So hopefully, a student loan repayment wouldn't impact them too much. Sure. Yeah, Brian. LongHorn has been executing well for the last few years. And I keep -- I want to comment Todd and his team, they've been on this journey in quality, simplicity and culture. That's what Todd talks about every day, investing in quality and portions that continue to pay off. They had almost 7.1% same-restaurant sales growth in the quarter. That was driven by some pricing. They've had more inflation, but they also have had record weekly sales and Mother's Day, and yes, they're 34% above pre-COVID levels in sales versus Q4. And traffic is positive over pre-COVID. So I can't tell you it's any silver bullet and we've talked about that in the past that there aren't silver bullets here. It's about having great execution, investing in your team, investing in your product to drive profitable same-restaurant sales growth. And that's what they've been doing. Yeah, Brian. Let me talk about differences and why we believe that there's not a whole \u2013 a lot of overlap between the Ruth's customer and a capital growth customer. But I will preface this by saying, we've only owned them for 8 days. And before we closed the deal, we were not allowed to see their consumer data, right? We were still competitors, and we couldn't see their consumer data other than looking at third-party data that we would have. So we want to start looking at their data to understand it a little bit better. But one of the primary reasons is geography. If you look at \u2013 they have 150-ish restaurants, including the franchise system, and they have restaurants in markets that Capital Grille doesn't have restaurants in. And even in restaurants to capital, even in markets that Capital Grille has restaurants in, they're not necessarily close to each other in a lot of those markets. So there isn't as much overlap as you would expect. And that's a good thing for us, good thing for Ruth Chris, and it's a good thing for Capital Grille. And \u2013 but then I would add that if you think about ADBs and Capital Grille, we've had this kind of scenario for many years. Where ADBs guests may go to Capital Grille, but they go for different occasions. And we want to learn a little bit about that at routes on the occasion differences. And then finally, I think Capital Grille is a little bit more, going back to geography, a little bit more mix in urban than Roots, an urban core versus Ruth Chris, where Ruth Chris, for example, if you have a restaurant in Birmingham, we don't have \u2013 or in Destin, Florida. There's the Ruth Chris. We don't have Capital Grille there. So there's reasons that there isn't as much overlap as you would have thought. Yeah, Jake. Yes, you would expect that as turnover goes down, productivity gets better, and we've started to see that already this year. So our turnover is improving and our productivity is getting better. So it's not like we're going from the highest turnover we've ever had to the lower turnover next year. We've actually started gradually moving to it. And one of the places that gets you the biggest productivity loss is the turnover in the first 90 days. And that's had a very big improvement for us. So you don't -- you have less productivity loss if you have less 90-day turnover. And so we've seen an improvement in turnover. We're still above pre-COVID levels, but we're a lot closer to our pre-COVID levels than we were just last month and the last month before that, the month before that. And we'll continue to improve I don't know if we'll ever get back to pre-COVID level turnovers. But if we do, then that should give us even more productivity enhancements. Yeah, Jake. Our goal is still to get towards the higher end of the range. It might take us a little bit more time to get there than we originally thought. COVID has slowed a lot of stuff down in development. The permitting that Raj talked about, equipment that Raj talked about, those things are getting better than all the way back. It would be great if we could get permits as fast as we used to get them. It would be great if we can get utilities turn down as fast as we used to get them. That's just not come back anywhere near where we need it to be. And as we think about construction costs, getting back to a more normal level, Raj mentioned that we've had the last few contracts that we've bid out have come in better than what we expected. And that's a good sign for us. So that will help us get back to that higher end of our framework. And I would also remember, we don't talk about this very much, but that framework includes M&A. And while we would like to get to the high end of the framework just with organic growth, M&A is prime work. And the thing is when we shared that framework earlier today, the five year delta, the five year impact to the framework, had no M&A in it. And we were still within our -- within probably the mid-range of our unit growth. So M&A is part of that. It is part of our capital allocation. So -- but we would still like to get to the high end without M&A. And if I can just add one thing to that. If you think about our turnover coming down, that means we don't have as many people we're hiring as we were before. So we didn't have to hire as many people now than we did before. And so the wage, even if the wage break didn't happen, it's still not as big a deal for us, but the wage break is starting to happen. But the fact that we don't have to hire as many people helps us as well."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.\nKevin Kalicak: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the Company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2023 fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, June 22nd, before the market opens followed by a conference call. During today's call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing third quarter performance is a comparison to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence\u2019s, casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, and Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen. During our third fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales increased 7.2% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 3%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and our focus moving forward, and Raj will provide more details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2023 financial outlook. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter on both the top and bottom line. We significantly exceeded the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic, outperforming more on traffic than we did on sales. We also continued to underprice inflation, resulting in lower overall check growth relative to the industry. Our ability to make this investment and provide strong value to our guests reinforces the power of our strategy, which comes to life through our four competitive advantages and executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy. I am particularly proud of the way our restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level by being brilliant with the basics. This intense focus on providing great food, service and atmosphere enables them to consistently create memorable guest experiences. During the holiday season, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse set new all-time weekly sales records, only to break them during Valentine's week. In fact, all of our brands achieved record total sales for the quarter. Of course, none of this would be possible without having the right people in the right roles ready to serve our guests. Our restaurants continue to be well staffed and our manager staffing remains at historic highs. Our leaders work hard to ensure each of our restaurants is a great place to work. During the quarter, several of our brands were recognized as industry leaders by Black Box Intelligence. LongHorn and Eddie V's received the Best Practices Award, which evaluates the brand's employee retention as well as sales and traffic performance. Olive Garden, The Capital Grille and Seasons 52 were honored with the Employer of Choice Award, which is based on workforce data, including employee turnover and gender and racial diversity. We know from our recent engagement survey results that our overall level of engagement is very high, and our team members understand what is expected of them at work. This is helping drive high guest satisfaction metrics, both internally and externally. Data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index shows customer satisfaction is down across all industries. However, across all of our brands, our internal guest satisfaction ratings remain exceptionally strong. In fact, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Yard House and Bahama Breeze achieved all-time highs during the quarter. Additionally, for the second consecutive quarter, the Darden brand was ranked number one among major casual dining brands in each measurement category within Technomic\u2019s industry tracking tool. Even with the traffic growth we achieved during the quarter, to-go sales remained strong, accounting for 26% of total sales at Olive Garden, 14% at LongHorn and 12% at Cheddar's. We continue to leverage technology to make it easier to order a pick up and pay without having to pass the added expense of third-party delivery on to our guests. Our teams are executing the off-premise experience at a high level. For example, to-go orders accounted for 33% of Olive Garden's total sales on Valentine's Day, and they significantly improved their ratings for both on-time and order accuracy for that day. For the quarter, digital transactions accounted for more than 62% of all off-premise sales and 10% of Darden's total sales. Finally, we opened 7 new restaurants during the quarter across 7 states. Our new restaurant opening teams continue to do an excellent job of hiring and training new team members and successfully opening these locations. We are on track to open 25 net new restaurants during the fourth quarter, and I am confident in our ability to do so because of our well-prepared leadership pipeline and the tremendous support teams we have in place. We are fortunate to have the best team members in the industry, and I am proud of the focus and commitment they continue to display. On behalf of our senior leadership team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank all of our team members for everything you do to nourish and delight our guests and each other. Now, I will turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone. We had high expectations for the third quarter sales growth as we were wrapping on last January\u2019s Omicron outbreak and several weeks of severe winter weather that combined to reduce sales by over $100 million in the third quarter of last year. Exceeded those high expectations, posting record total sales of $2.8 billion, which was 13.8% higher than last year, driven by 11.7% same-restaurant sales growth along with the addition of 35 net new restaurants. This same restaurant sales performance outpaced the industry by 450 basis points, and our same-restaurant guest counts performed even more as they exceeded the industry benchmark by 700 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.34, an increase of 21.2% above last year. Total EBITDA was $448 million, and we returned $272 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter, consisting of $148 million in dividends and $124 million in share repurchases. Total pricing for the quarter was approximately 6.3%, 70 basis points below total inflation of roughly 7%. Now looking at our margin performance compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses rose 110 basis points, driven by commodities inflation of approximately 9%, which was higher than we anticipated going into the quarter and significantly outpaced pricing of 6.3%. Chicken, dairy and grains continue to be categories experiencing the highest levels of inflation, but each improved versus prior quarter as we expected. However, beef inflation increased from the second quarter level and drove the majority of our higher-than-anticipated commodities inflation this quarter. Restaurant labor was 120 basis points better than last year as we benefited from sales leverage and our restaurants continue to run efficient labor despite hourly wage inflation of 8%. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7%. Restaurant expenses were 40 basis points favorable to last year as we leveraged higher sales that more than offset elevated inflation on utilities as well as higher repairs and maintenance expense. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points lower than last year, driven by sales leverage. G&A expenses were 40 basis points higher than last year, driven by the timing of our incentive compensation accrual and other expenses. Operating income margin of 12.6% was 30 basis points better than last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%, and we ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $287 million. Now looking at our margin performance versus pre COVID, we grew operating income by 70 basis points, while underpricing inflation by more than 400 basis points since pre-COVID. Increased food and beverage costs were more than offset by improved productivity, reduced marketing and other cost savings initiatives. Looking at our segment performance. All of our segments significantly outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. Sales at Olive Garden grew 13.9% above last year, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 12.3%. Average weekly sales at Olive Garden were 108% of pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 22.5% was 150 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage and labor efficiencies. LongHorn sales grew 13.5% above last year, with same-restaurant sales growth of 10.8%. Average weekly sales at LongHorn were 127% of the pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 17.4% was 80 basis points below last year, driven by elevated commodities inflation. Sales in our Fine Dining segment grew 13.2% over last year driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 11.7% and average weekly sales were 113% of the pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 21.8% and was 110 basis points below last year, driven by elevated commodities inflation. Our other segment sales grew 14.1% above last year with the same restaurant sales growth of 11.7% and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 14% was 20 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage and labor efficiencies. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We have increased our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of $10.45 billion to $10.5 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 6.5% to 7%, approximately 55 new restaurant openings, capital spending between $550 million to $575 million, total inflation of 7% to 7.5% and annual pricing of 6% to 6.5%. Furthermore, we expect commodities inflation between 9.5% and 10%, the annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 123 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.85 and $8. This outlook implies fourth quarter sales between $2.73 billion and $2.78 billion, same-restaurant sales between 3% and 5%, diluted net earnings per share between $2.43 and $2.58. It also implies higher commodities inflation than we last communicated. We now expect commodities inflation that is solidly in the low-single-digit range for the fourth quarter versus the closer to flat estimate we shared with you on the last earnings call. Increase in commodities inflation is primarily due to higher-than-anticipated beef costs. For fiscal 2024, we anticipate opening 50 to 55 new restaurants and capital spending between $300 million and $325 million related to new restaurants and another $200 million to $225 million related to ongoing restaurant maintenance, refresh and technology spending. And while we don't normally provide a commodity outlook this early for the next fiscal year, we are anticipating low-single-digit inflation for the total commodities basket in fiscal 2024 led by high single-digit inflation on beef and produce. We expect all other categories to range from slight deflation to low single-digit inflation. With that, I'd like to close by saying that we continue to be very proud of how our teams are managing their businesses to deliver strong results in this dynamic environment. Now, we'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets.\nChris Carril: So, I just wanted to talk or ask first about the top line trends. So, I guess, just given the choppiness in the comparison to last year, could you talk about the progression of sales through the quarter? Maybe specifically what you saw following the Omicron lap, and maybe perhaps what you're seeing in the current quarter just as we're trying to get a sense of where trends are shaking out kind of on a normalized basis? I know, Rick, you spoke of the strength around the Valentine's Day. So, any detail beyond that point would be great.\nRaj Vennam: Hey Chris, this is Raj. Good morning. So, when we actually look at our underlying traffic trends versus pre-COVID, excluding the noise from holidays and weather and promotions, they've actually been fairly stable month-to-month and that has continued into the fourth quarter. And basically, everything we know of the quarter-to-date is incorporated in our guidance. But when you step back and look at versus pre-COVID, it's pretty stable.\nChris Carril: And then, I appreciate the preliminary commodity inflation outlook for FY24. So, thanks for providing that this morning. Any thoughts on -- or any guidance you could provide on how you're thinking about just pricing here going forward just relative to that commodity inflation outlook that you're providing for FY24?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Chris, I think the way we think about pricing is we look at total inflation. And I think as we talked about, over the last three years, we\u2019ve underpriced inflation by over 400 basis points. And also, we\u2019ve underpriced full-service CPI by over 600 basis points. So, we created a significant gap between our competitors, and it positions us well as we head into the next year. We'll share more thoughts on our fiscal 2024 pricing plans the next -- in the June call.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbour: Yes. Thank you. Maybe just a question on the labor side. I know that you're in a very good place right now on staffing. Do you still see -- as you look into next year, do you still envision taking up wages continually. And I think, obviously, we're in an environment where it's important to kind of retain people and continue to pay better than your peers. How does that kind of factor into what you expect from a wage inflation perspective going forward?\nRick Cardenas: Hey Brian, this is Rick. Let's talk about our staffing. As we mentioned on our call, we're very well staffed. We have more managers per restaurant than we\u2019ve ever had in our history. So, we feel really good about where we are. We\u2019re not going to talk necessarily about what our wage growth will be next year. I will say that even before COVID, wage inflation was in the mid-signal-digit. So, we will continue to work with whatever the economy comes our way and however we can handle that. But we have a great employment proposition. Our turnover is significantly reducing. It's getting closer to our pre-COVID levels. And we still think we've got room to improve our turnover. We're hiring great people and we're being as discerning as we had been before COVID. So, we feel really good about where we are. And we'll talk about our inflation targets and our pricing and all of those things in June.\nBrian Harbour: Thank you. And maybe just on capital spending. I know you kind of took up the low end of that. But what's driving that? Is there -- is that more of an inflationary thing, or is there any sort of bucket of spending that's running higher at this point?\nRaj Vennam: Well, I think we've talked about inflation being one of the big things, right? When you look at construction costs have gone up quite a bit, especially when you compare it to pre-COVID, and we're ramping up growth. So, we do have -- I think this year, we said we're approximately 55 new units and then we talked about next year kind of in that 50 to 55 as well. So, it's really a function of the increase in construction costs. I think on the construction cost front, especially the FF&E for new restaurants has been growing quite a bit. And so that's -- it's -- you're seeing a 25-plus-percent increase in those costs related to pre-COVID. So those are really the big drivers. But having said that, given the improvements we've made to our business models and where our unit economics are, we still have pretty strong returns on our new units, and we continue to want to grow that. And that's why we do want to try to target as much growth as we can. Now, we're going to be disciplined in how we do that. But we have -- we're being a little bit more selective, but still, we feel like we have opportunity to take share.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: My question, I guess, Raj, if you could just tell us what level of pricing you are running in the fourth quarter. And just trying to frame up the comp guidance of 3% to 5% and what might be implied from a traffic perspective in that number.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. David, I think we have -- basically, we're going to be under 6%. So call it, 5.5% to 6% is probably what we're running or expect to be running in Q4.\nDavid Tarantino: Got it. And then, I guess then the guidance implies maybe slightly negative traffic. And I was wondering if you or Rick could you comment just on why you think that is? And is it a macro issue, or is it something else in your view? And maybe, Rick, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the current macro environment given all the volatility we've seen lately. Just how are you thinking about kind of the outlook for the next several quarters?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. David, let's talk about the macro for the macro consumer. But if you think about where our guide is for the next quarter, if you look at it versus pre-COVID, you take out the Omicron change and the Never-Ending Pasta Bowl change that we did in Q2. When you think about pre-COVID, our trends are very similar, even what we're thinking about for Q4. So -- but as you think about the state of the consumer and the state of the economy, we've said this in previous calls, there's been a shift in spending from durable goods to services, restaurant businesses are benefiting from that. What's interesting is, for most of calendar year 2022, customer sentiment was pretty bad, but consumer spending was significantly high. So even though they were thinking that things were bad, they were still spending. And so, we think as long as the unemployment rate is low and wages are increasing, consumers should continue to spend. Casual dining same-restaurant sales improved sequentially each quarter during the fiscal year and our positive gap to the industry improved, especially in traffic. So, we feel like what we're doing is really helping us. I will also say the data from our proprietary brand health tracker suggests that most consumers are not pulling back from restaurant visits and they do not appear to be trading down from full service to limited service based on the data that we have. Now there is a tension between what people want and what they can afford. Consumers continue to seek value, which is not about low prices, consumers are making spending trade-offs. And food away from home is one of the most difficult expenses to give up because going out to a restaurant is still an affordable luxury for them. And so, what does that mean for us? For our brands, we believe that operators that can deliver on their brand promise and value will continue to appeal to consumers, despite economic challenges. And that's what we remain focused on doing, no matter what happens in the industry and whatever happens to the category.\nDavid Tarantino: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. The first one, just on the implied fourth quarter earnings guidance, looks like that's growth of maybe 8% to 15%. I know last quarter, you talked about maybe the third quarter and the fourth quarter should be pretty even in terms of growth both quarters. The third quarter grew 21%. So, it just looks like you're maybe tempering the earnings growth algo for the fourth quarter relative to the third. Just wondering whether you view that as conservatism or perhaps it's the modest uptick in inflation. Kind of how you think about the sequential trend from an earnings perspective in the fourth relative to the third quarter? And then, I had one follow-up.\nRaj Vennam: Hey Jeff. It's actually what you said. It's the commodities inflation. We did -- as we said last call, we thought Q4 was going to be flat, closer to flat. And then now that we're saying that's in the -- solidly in the low single digits. So, when you kind of layer that in, that's where the growth is a little bit less. But outside of -- that's really the primary dynamic that's different.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just following up on the macro question with interest rates still on the rise. I'm just wondering how does that impact your business or how you manage it, if at all, in terms of new unit growth, which seems to still be stable or how you think about borrowings or whether you think it impacts consumer behavior, maybe any return of cash decisions? Like, how does that come into play, if at all, as you manage the business? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Jeff, this is Rick. The interest rates really aren\u2019t making a huge impact in our business. We actually have a significant balance in cash. So, higher interest rates has actually given us a little bit more interest over time. You think about our new restaurant openings that we have seen inflation, as Raj mentioned. And so, we're being prudent in looking at some of these deals and saying, you know what, we might wait just a little bit of time to see if we can get a second bid sometimes during this year, we're only getting one bid for some of these sites. So we want to be prudent. But the interest rates really haven't done anything for us. And if you think about the consumer, they're still spending. We'll see what happens when these credit card balances, which were at record highs in December, come due, but they're still spending today. So, so far, nothing in our space. As it pertains to return of cash, we have a very strong dividend as we announced it again today. We feel like that's one way we return our cash to shareholders. We'll talk about our capital returns coming up in June. But it hasn't really changed our outlook and what we think about our long-term framework. So, if you go back to our framework and how we return cash to shareholders, we've got targets for our rough dividend as a percent of our earnings and how much we buy back in shares. This year, we've bought back somewhere in the $400-and-some-odd million and our share count target that we gave you would imply a little bit more in the fourth quarter. But we'll talk more about our return on cash and our long-term framework in June.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And Rick, just to clarify, I think you mentioned before that you've seen relative stability in sales through the fiscal third quarter and even into March. Just from the outside looking, and I mean, with the most recent banking noise and things like that over the past few weeks. Does that lead to greater volatility day to day or week to week, or do you really not see it in the restaurant sales line, despite all the headlines that create so much noise for the broader macro?\nRick Cardenas: Well, Jeff, I think if you think about March, when you think, volatility will happen in March just because of shifts in spring break. So you have to take that into account. But trends are fairly consistent. So, when you think about a state might change where the spring break is. So, that will show volatility at restaurants. But in general, we feel like our trends haven't really changed much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Long with Stephens.\nJosh Long: In terms of the context of relative visibility in your business, how are you thinking about the marketing and the messaging opportunity as we go into the back half of the year and then into fiscal '24? I mean, still at kind of lower levels versus what we have seen on marketing spend basis versus prior years. Are you comfortable with that? Is there any reason to kind of adjust that strategy as we go into what could be a more challenging or potentially volatile macroeconomic environment?\nRick Cardenas: Hey Josh, this is Rick. We're not going to get into too much detail on our promotional plans, but I would say that our marketing spend isn't going to be significantly different year-over-year. It might be 10 to 20 basis points either way, up or down as we think about next year. But as we've said before, advertising is always going to be part of Olive Garden's mix because of the scale advantage they have. And so, we'll continue to leverage that scale advantage with Olive Garden. And we'll use the filters that we mentioned before, to evaluate any marketing activity, elevating -- it has to elevate brand equity. It has to be simple to execute, and it's not going to be at a deep discount. And so, we plan on sticking to that strategy. But if things dramatically change, we'll react accordingly. And as we've said many times in the past, if and when we increase our marketing spend, we'd expect it to earn a return compared to where we would have been without it. So, it should be a positive ROI, and it shouldn't impact our -- it shouldn't hurt our margins.\nJosh Long: Understood. That's helpful. And then, maybe one follow-up for me. In terms of talking about the restaurant manager pipeline and the fact that you mentioned having more restaurant managers than you've had in your history. Can you talk about the benefits and kind of just the opportunities that unlocks from either a service component or how you should think about -- how we should think about that positively impacting guest experience as we go forward and maybe helping to drive that gap versus the industry a bit wider over time?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Josh. The manager role in our restaurants is the most important role we have, especially the general manager, the managing partner. And being fully staffed there gives them more time to spend with their team and train their team, develop them, make them stronger and just spend that time forecasting their business and spending time with guests. If you're under staff managers, the restaurant doesn't run as well. But the other thing about being fully staffed with managers and have the highest staffing in our history is that that helps us open restaurants going forward, right? If you think about our pipeline of new units, we have about 25 net openings coming in this quarter, and we are ready for it with the managers that we have. So, there's a lot of benefits of being fully staffed managers can spend more time with their team, they can spend more time with guests, and we have the managers to open our restaurants.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Good morning. So Rick, you mentioned that the ability to price below inflation is giving Darden the ability to grow faster than the market in terms of sales and traffic. So, are you expecting the same momentum to continue if inflation decelerates and food at home inflation perhaps increases at a lower pace compared to the food away from home inflation?\nRick Cardenas: Well, our strategy has been this strategy for quite a while, and we plan on sticking to it. It's really helped us over the long term on whether inflation has been high or inflation has been low. If inflation comes down or things slow down, a lot of our pricing is already built in for next year based on where we are right now. And so, we'll be able to react accordingly. In the long run, we plan on pricing below inflation. But in any 12-month period, it might be a little bit higher, a little bit lower than inflation. That said, we believe that our scale advantage gives us the opportunity to find cost savings so that we can price below inflation in the long run, to drive a better value for our guests. And as we said earlier, guests appreciate value, especially when or if the economy slows down a little bit, they go for places that they get a great value and they get great consistent experiences, and that's what we intend to provide.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Thank you. And maybe, Raj, what caused the marginal deceleration in expectations on net new units? And if you can also comment on your recent comment of strong returns in the new units and that you're going to be a little bit more selective. So, can you share how the real estate strategy is evolving over time?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. So a couple of things. The new units, I think we talked about, part of it is just the construction delays and the challenges we've had. And we are still opening quite a few. I mean, our expectation for this year is approximately 55 new openings. So, we're opening quite a bit. As far as the comment on the returns, when we look at our new units actually -- especially the recent openings have actually outperformed on the top line more than we expected going into. So, they are actually opening at most of our brands. They're opening at volumes that are exceeding what we would have estimated going into the -- when we approved the capital for the project. So overall, we always had a lot of headroom in our -- in terms of the returns versus our cost of capital. And so, we are exceeding the hurdle by a wide margin even with the increased construction cost.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: I wanted to ask one more on margin and maybe Raj, if there's any update to how you're thinking about holding on to gains longer term that you've seen since the pandemic? I know you've recently kind of spoken more to a long-term total return algorithm rather than sort of an annual margin growth number. But just curious if you have any new observations or thoughts on sort of longer term margin trajectory, given what you've seen recently?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Dennis, I think we've talked about this year -- we've been purposeful and deliberate in actually choosing to price where we price, right, over the last few years because of the gains we have had versus pre-COVID. Our intent would be to try to grow from these levels. But in a given year, it can be different. Ultimately, we do go back to that 10% to 15% TSR. That's the EPS growth plus the dividend yield. And how we get there, any given year might be different. But from where we are starting at the end of this fiscal year, we expect to build margins over time.\nDennis Geiger: That's great. I appreciate that. And just one more, just on the 24 new openings, can you speak to whether the breakdown by brand will look similar sort of to what you've seen in prior years? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. I think you're going to see a little bit more of Olive Garden openings just because they have the best returns in the portfolio, and they have -- we've shared that we think there is more opportunity for growth coming out of the pandemic. So, you might see 20ish in for them and then mid-teens for LongHorn and then everybody else making up the rest.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett.\nJeff Farmer: Great. Just following up on margins, some of the stuff you just discussed. But you did touch on marketing but your restaurant expense and G&A as a percent of revenue are running at looks like roughly 100 basis points below pre-COVID levels. Do you think that lower cost structure of both the restaurant and corporate level is sustainable moving forward?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. We always focus on -- that's the opportunity for us. When we talk about our scale benefiting, we always are trying to take costs that are not directly impacting the guest. So, that's really restaurant expenses and G&A are the two places where we think our scale benefits us the most in terms of being able to take costs out, leverage our scale. And so, we do expect those to continue to be -- maintain a wider gap to pre-COVID, positive gap.\nJeff Farmer: And then, just one more on the -- follow-up on the lower income customer sort of demand profile. You've obviously pointed to some slowing demand there, but I'm just curious how that manifests itself? Is that sort of reduced visit or check management? How does that show up when that lower income customer changes their behavior?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. In the past, we had talked about our lower income consumer, over the last few quarters, the mix shifting down a little bit, but still being above pre-COVID. The good news is we haven't seen a material change in mix from the last time we talked to now in that lower end consumer. But if it manifests itself, it generally starts with managing check. Generally, consumers will manage their check first, and then they'll manage their visits later. And so far, we really haven't seen a whole lot of check management. So, that tells you, based on what I said earlier, consumer sentiment was pretty bad in '22, but consumers still spent. And as people shifted to restaurants, we benefited. So, we haven't seen it yet. We may see it. And when we do, it will start at check probably and then it will impact probably more likely impact our lower-end consumer brands, not that they're lower end brands, they just have a bigger mix of lower-end consumers, and it will impact less our high-end brands. But that's the benefit of a portfolio and the portfolio that we have that we can withstand shocks to one segment of the population.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: One quick bookkeeping question. Raj, as we think about 2023 EPS guidance, is roughly $390 million still the right number for G&A?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. That's right.\nAndrew Charles: Okay. And then I realize that you guys are going to provide 2024 guidance on the 4Q call. But just in the backdrop of this uncertain macro environment, combined with inflation has just proven stubbornly high. Can you talk about your confidence in the ability to deliver 10% plus TSR in 2024 and just the different avenues you could take to get there if we were to see a slowing consumer backdrop? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Andrew, this is Rick. I will say that if you think about our confidence returning a TSR of 10% to 15% in any one year, we've said many times that in any one year, it could be below that or above that. And remember that\u2019s earnings growth and dividend yield. I will say, go back in our history since we've been a public company, we've never had a 10-year period that we have had less than a 10-year -- 10% annualized total shareholder return. So, we feel confident over the long run that we're going to get to 10% to 15%. We're not going to talk about next year. But I would feel like we're pretty confident we should be able to get there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi.\nJon Tower: Awesome. Great. Thanks for taking the question. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. I was really -- I was struck by the commentary about your own consumer survey suggesting that your customers are not trading down from limited service -- excuse me, away from full-service into limited service. Frankly, it's counter to what we've been hearing from a handful of operators in recent weeks. So I'm curious to hear from you, is that broadly speaking about just your -- or is that speaking specifically about your brands, or is it more broadly about the full-service category? Number one. And then number two, can you talk about what these customers are telling you as to why they're sticking with your brand versus trading down elsewhere? Are they using you differently now than, say, in years past, when thinking about their own budgeting for going out or eating away from home?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Jon, this is Rick. What we said earlier is most customers aren't. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't any customers shifting from full-service to limited service, but most aren't. And we're not really seeing that in our results. So, others might be, but what we have been doing is providing a great value. We've actually taken a lot less pricing than most of our competition. So, that might be a reason that others might be seeing that when we're not. And we're improving our guest experience. So, at the same time that we've taken pricing that was lower than inflation by Raj said, 400 or 500 basis points versus pre-COVID, we've been improving our experience. Our customer satisfaction is growing. We've had records at Cheddar's and Yard House, as I mentioned already. So, I think that's what people will crave when environments get a little bit tougher. They crave things that provide them a great value. And that gives them a consistent experience. And we've been doing that, and we'll continue to do that.\nJon Tower: Okay. So, you're suggesting that this brand survey work you did is more specific to your brands than necessarily the whole full service category?\nRick Cardenas: No, I'm not suggesting that it's only our brands. What I'm saying is that most consumers aren't trading down. Some are, but most aren't. And in prior big downturns or things like that, we had a lot -- we had a lot more consumers trade down. We haven't seen that. Now, when I talk about specifically to our brands, our satisfaction is up. Our value is better than it was before. So, there's a little bit of both in my answer, industry and us.\nJon Tower: Got it. Okay. Just circling back to the marketing question. I know we hit on it a few times already, but I'm curious what the trigger might be. Are you going to be a little bit more reactionary in terms of waiting to see some slowdown or if there is one that comes before necessarily pulling that trigger? And I understand the context that you put around how you would go after increasing marketing by not necessarily offering deep discounts. But just curious to know what sort of triggers you're looking for in the marketplace? Maybe it's just the slippage in traffic, either relative or absolute before you start spending a little bit more on the marketing side?\nRick Cardenas: Hey John, it's Rick. We're not necessarily going to talk about specific triggers. What I can say is we're going to be very prudent in our marketing spend. We've done a lot over the last few years to simplify our business to make it easier to operate and we've done a lot of testing during this time on what marketing really does drive. And when things change dramatically, we may change. But right now, we're going to continue to stick to our strategy of making our communication be much more branded, elevating brand equity, simple to execute, and we don't expect it to be a deep discount. So, we've -- this industry has gone through this before, buying guests, and we're not ones that are going to go out and buy guests. We're going to continue to do what we do and strengthen our business. And if things change, then we may react.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Just a follow-up on that, I think. I know we've talked about most consumers not trading from full service to limited service and certainly giving up dining out, something that people don't want to do, especially when they're employed, but you're guiding, and I assume a lot of guidance over the next three months or so, is assuming a negative same-store traffic. So I guess the question is the grocery in terms of total number of meals consumed is still bigger than restaurants, actually multiple, maybe 2-plus x restaurants depending on how you want to calculate it. Grocery pricing has actually been well in excess of restaurant pricing. It remains so now. When you guys think for it and this is, I guess, a forward-looking question, really a view of your industry. Grocery pricing oftentimes follows commodities. Commodities are expected to drop just in your own language from what was 10-plus percent to very low single digits. Is there like a way to kind of be prepared for grocery kind of retaking relative value relative to restaurants? And is that something that you think about internally and maybe to Jon Tower's question of maybe bringing back some advertising, bringing back some promotion just to make sure that you're keeping customers maybe the bottom 5% or 10%, whatever you want to say, still coming your brand and using the brand even if year-over-year grocery start and other brands, perhaps limited service included start to emerge as a pricing opportunity for them.\nRick Cardenas: Yes John, thanks. It's Rick. One of the things I want to let everybody make sure they hear is we're not going to risk margin, significant margin declines because of what happens in the economy. If food costs go down, think about what we've said in the past, a 1% decline in commodity inflation will offset a 2% decline in traffic, all else equal, with us doing nothing. So if commodity costs come down and inflation comes down, we can weather a little bit of a traffic decline and still get to the same EBITDA. So, I think we have to think -- and the industry has to think long term about how they drive traffic through discounting. And we have made that shift and we made that shift, even started it before COVID to drive traffic through better experiences, better overall value and not discounting to a very small -- a small portion of our guest base. So, that's our strategy going forward. If things change, we'll let you know.\nJohn Ivankoe: Well -- and I think that's very clear to lesson permanently learned, not temporarily learned, and I think that's important certainly to hear and express. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.\nChris O\u2019Cull: Rick, you've tied the traffic outperformance this quarter to less pricing than the competition. So, I'm just wondering why you believe consumers are now noticing that difference in relative value. If there was some sort of trigger with a marketing or advertising effort, or what do you think has caused that change this quarter?\nRick Cardenas: Hey Chris, I would say that I don't think it's just this quarter. I think it's been a long time what we've been doing. We've been underpricing inflation. Even before COVID, we started underpricing inflation, and we've been putting more on the plate. And so, we've actually invested while underpricing. And so, if you look at variable margin, contribution margin, just take Olive Garden, for example, you can't do the math. But if you look at contribution margin in Olive Garden, it's lower today than it was before COVID. But their margins [indiscernible] are up. So our consumers are seeing that they're getting more value when they come into the restaurants, and that doesn't take -- it doesn't take a week to figure that out. It takes them a long time to figure that out. And that's why when we talk about what we're doing, you have to think about this over the long run because we're not shouting out to the rooftops that we've done this. The closest that we did to that was brought Never-Ending Pasta Bowl back at a $3 higher price to show people that we still have some great value in our restaurants, and Olive Garden being on TV talking about the things that make their brand special. Right now, where we've got back on our advertising and sauces sold and talking about our freshly made cases every day, while we still have a 15-second spot talking about our never-ending first course. And so -- and that never-ending first course is on us. There aren't many brands that actually give you never-ending that for every item that you order. And so, again, it's not something that we necessarily talk about. We don't go out and shout from the rooftops that we have lower prices than others do or we've priced less. They see it as they come into our restaurants, and that builds over time.\nChris O\u2019Cull: That's great. And I know you guys have a rich consumer data set. I mean, does your data indicate that certain consumer segments have increased their frequency of visits, especially at Olive Garden?\nRick Cardenas: What I would say is versus pre-COVID, our data would tell us that -- that we're getting a little bit younger than we were before COVID across all of our brands, and that's somewhat driven by an increase in to go business. But the great news is a lot of these folks had actually used us for to go for the first time, and that's their first visit to us, are actually starting to come into our restaurant, too. So it was kind of a handshake to come in. And so we're slightly younger, but our consumer segments are fairly similar to what they were before. And that's great news for us. We're also getting a little bit more frequency in our core guests. And that's really what we've been focusing on. So, the good news is our consumers are not that different. They're slightly younger. That means that we don't have to really change what we're doing because we can keep talking to our consumers just like we have been before.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nKatherine Griffin: Hi. Thank you. This is Katherine Griffin on for Sara. I just wanted to ask again on marketing, sorry. Just if you could speak a little bit about what you're seeing at other restaurants, if you're seeing them ramping up on marketing and promotional spending?\nRick Cardenas: Hey Katherine, this is Rick. You probably see it just as much as we do. But I can tell you that there's a big competitor that just went back on TV and they talked about it before, they did it. And you've got some of these other competitors that are out there a little bit more on television than they were before. That said, Olive Garden still is usually in the top 2 or 3 of advertising spend in our space, and we're doing that through branded kind of advertising versus deals.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO.\nAndrew Strelzik: I just wanted to ask about the customer satisfaction scores you mentioned and you talked about records, I believe, or all-time highs at Cheddar's and Yard House and maybe Bahama Breeze as well, but not at Olive Garden and LongHorn. It does sound like they're up, but not maybe as much as some of the others. So I guess I'm just curious what your perception is of the difference between the two, why maybe those aren't up as much and how that maybe is guiding your strategy going forward? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Andrew, this is Rick. Let me start by saying that satisfaction at Olive Garden and LongHorn are significantly high, and our other brands, our fine owning brands are very high. And so it takes a little bit more to move them up significantly versus what we've seen at Cheddar's and Yard House. Cheddar's and Yard House and others have made significant improvements to their brand, significant improvements to service and significant improvement to value, and customers see that. And so, we've had great performance at our -- at those brands that I mentioned, having record highs. But I wouldn't tell you that the others aren't at or near their records. It's just Cheddar's and Yard House actually made a record this quarter.\nAndrew Strelzik: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And maybe just one other one about the value proposition. And obviously, you're very positive on how that's driving the comps. We're coming out of a period now -- or the pricing environment overall maybe seems to be settling a little bit. And I'm curious if you've gone through the exercise or maybe just an ongoing exercise where you've looked at where your brands stand and what are the different pieces of the menu seeing now? I'm curious if there's any opportunities to address within menus or within brands, now that maybe things have settled a little bit.\nRick Cardenas: I think we always look at what -- where we have opportunities within menus, within brands, within regions of the country, and we will never stop. What I would tell you is we feel really good about where our pricing is, and we feel really good that we've been able to price well below what most of our competitors have done. And that gives us, as Raj said, some room to take a little bit more pricing if we want to take a little bit more pricing. And so, we will always look, and we generally try to price restaurants into strength and not into weakness, and we have a lot of great data scientists here that help us look at that. And we also talk to our operators and get their perspective. So that won't change no matter what happens in the economy or what happens with others. We'll continue to do what we do, and we feel like we've earned the right to keep doing what we've done.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: I think investors are looking at the industry trend and they're thinking about comparisons on a multiyear basis. And they're thinking the industry is going to go flat, something like that in the second half of calendar '23. And so, that's sort of where people's heads are with regard to casual dining. I wonder, do you think that is too pessimistic? I mean, based on what you're seeing because, obviously, four-year trends don't need to stay stable. But if that were to happen, your gap is positive to that industry at this point. And you've been very clear on this call about you're not wanting to pull levers unless it really got bad. But if you're doing 2-plus points better than that and you're coming along in the low single digits, would you not really change your mix too much with regard to the advertising and the value marketing and kind of stay the course?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. David, I don't want to talk necessarily about the second half of fiscal -- of calendar '23 because that's fiscal '24 for us. But I think if you look back in history and you look back in other slowdowns, if that is what happens, and you look at some of our brands, Olive Garden significantly outperformed during that time because guests go for -- where they see value and they go to trusted brands, and I think Olive Garden is one of the most trusted brands out there. So, we would expect that we could outperform. I can't say we will, but I think we -- I think that's what our history would stay. And so, we're going to look at our marketing mix just like we've done in the last few years, and we may move it a couple of tenths here or there. But unless something dramatically changes, we don't anticipate doing anything differently.\nDavid Palmer: The other thing I was wondering about is just seeing those Cheddar's scores being number one in value, first of all, congrats on all these scores. But Cheddar's has a big TAM potentially. I mean varied menu is a big thing, originally this might have been thought to be bought and become a bar and grill killer that varied menu is a big category and value scores are going to help you move into the center of the country much better returns. So any thoughts about maybe metrics on returns and you're growing 11, 12 units right now a year. Why can't that maybe go up quite a bit as you see that brand where it is today? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, David. I would say when we bought Cheddar's, we thought they had a lot of opportunities ahead of them. We still believe they have a lot of opportunities ahead of them. And we're going to be prudent on their growth as we make sure that they have the leadership teams for their restaurant to grow. I said it at ICR that the world is littered with brands that grew too fast, and we're very, very strategic on how we open our -- grow our brands. And so, the days of 10-plus percent growth for a brand at Darden, that doesn't happen very much. And so with Cheddar's, we're going to be prudent. We're going to open in the single digits for a little while to see how they continue to do. And as we infill markets that they already have restaurants in, and we find ways to get into new markets, as long as we have the people to do it, we can grow them. And I will tell you that John Wilkerson and his team have done a great job developing their people to have people ready to open these restaurants. And the more pipeline we have of people, the faster we can open.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: On the traffic outperformance, 700 basis-point gap, do you view this level of outperformance as sustainable, or how do you think about the outperformance?\nRick Cardenas: Hey Lauren, this is Rick. 700 basis points of outperformance is pretty strong. It all really depends on what the total traffic growth is for the industry. If we do -- if the industry is growing at 1%, do we expect to get 7% every quarter in outperformance, no? And if anybody would say that, I think that's thinking a little bit too hard. We're very pleased with that outperformance of 700 basis points this quarter, but we wouldn't expect to be 700 basis points every quarter. And there might be quarters that we have lower performance and traffic than our competition. But we think about this over the long term. And over the long term, we expect to outperform.\nLauren Silberman: And then just on M&A, I know you've talked about that in the past and interested in another brand. I guess what are you seeing in the current environment? Any change in the calls that you guys are getting or valuation?\nRick Cardenas: I don't want to get into the detail on calls we're getting or valuations we're getting. All I can say is we've said before, biggest competitive advantage we have is our scale. And one of the ways to build that scale is to buy other brands. And as volatility reduces, price discovery improves. And so, that's what we've got to continue to think about. And interest rates have made some change. So, we still feel like we'll talk to our Board when the right opportunities come to play, and we'll be ready when they do.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Just as we look at the quarter, your EBIT margins obviously expanded this quarter, but it was the first time in many quarters that we saw EBIT margin expansion. And it seems to be primarily driven by Olive Garden when we look at the segments. Olive Garden was the only segment that showed measurable margin expansion this quarter. The other segments were actually down on average. So, can you talk about the drivers of the bifurcation in margin performance for Olive Garden versus the rest of the segments? And is that kind of how the margin trend should continue over the next couple of quarters?\nRaj Vennam: Hey Brian, any given quarter, I think the brand to brand, it's a function of the pricing versus inflation. So, if you look at -- and frankly, as I mentioned, in the third quarter, beef was the biggest surprise, right? So for instance, our LongHorn and to some extent, our Fine Dining brands, they weren't prepared for that level of inflation. So the pricing hadn't been in place. And like I said in the past, the way we think about pricing is we're not going to overreact to near-term fluctuations. We kind of think about what's truly the more secure part of the inflation and try to price for it. And so, there was a little bit of really noise on that front this quarter that impacted the other segments. With that said, Olive Garden is our largest brand. I mean, that is -- it makes up over 50% of our sales and 55% or more of that profit. So for us to grow, you got to see Olive Garden to have some growth, or it takes a lot of heavy lifting from everybody else to make up. But the other thing with Olive Garden was we did -- some of the costs did moderate from where they were in the second quarter. So if you recall, second quarter, it was the other way around where the margins were deteriorating. And the third piece is Olive Garden was disproportionately impacted by Omicron last year. We talked about that last year. Now, as we wrap on it, they're benefiting from some of that. There were labor inefficiencies last year, so -- especially for them because of their geography and because of the demographic mix of their gas, it hurt them most and now you're seeing them outperform the most.\nBrian Bittner: And then just a follow-up, the labor margin leverage for the consolidated model was incredibly strong this quarter relative to any recent quarters in the past, and I realize your sales were strong this quarter, above average. But was there anything else going on within the execution of the labor margin this quarter outside of strong sales that you can point to that help that leverage amplify this quarter, so we can think about how labor can potentially be executed moving forward?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Brian, I think that's -- so obviously, as you mentioned, sales is the biggest part, but we are seeing turnover get better. And I think we called out last year, we had a lot of sick pay and some inefficiencies in labor last year because of Omicron. And so that's actually also helping. But you do see a quarter-to-quarter improvement, right? I mean, I think we progressed by over 100 basis points from second quarter to third quarter. And that's really the function of sales delta. We had almost $300 million more in sales, and that helps with a lot of leverage. And then the last piece, as I said earlier, is the retention is getting better, and that helps with improved productivity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim Securities.\nGregory Francfort: Rick, my question is just on your -- maybe how to think about margins, not necessarily in '24, but the next few years. Just because within your long-term framework of 10 to 30 basis points, when I look at this year, you had a big step down and a lot of that was food cost pressure. And I'm just wondering if you think that 10 to 30 basis points is the right way to think about it, and maybe does more of that come on the store-level margin side versus the G&A in the next several years? Any updated thoughts on that would be helpful. Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Hey Greg, thanks for the question. What I would say, first of all, is we've got that long-term framework of 10 to 30 basis points of margin expansion. We had significant margin expansion during COVID. And we talked about it last year that we'd probably give some of that back this year. So, we had significant expansion during COVID of over 200 basis points, I think to 250, and now we're closer to 150 pre-COVID. And so, as we think about going forward, as we get to our long-term framework and we still think our long-term framework will hold over time. And some of that will come probably at maybe a third to half of that will come below the restaurant level as we think about leveraging other costs. But as traffic grows and same-restaurant sales grow, we should still get some from the restaurant. But G&A should be some of that savings going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James.\nBrian Vaccaro: My question was just on labor and operations. There's obviously been a lot of new hires across the industry in the past 6 to 12 months. Are there any metrics you can share that speak to the proficiency of your staff and how that's benefiting operations? And just kind of to what degree you think that that could be driving your widening performance gap to the industry? And then also, would you be willing to share kind of where your manager and hourly turnover is currently running?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Brian, let me start by saying we've had a reduction in turnover, which has been helping us. Our team members are starting to learn more about what they do, especially the newer team members. And as I mentioned earlier, our manager staffing is at pretty high levels. And so, they can spend more time teaching their team and getting more productivity out of their team. Without getting into too much detail on turnover, our turnover is closer to pre-COVID levels than COVID levels. And we would intend to get it back towards those levels. What I would also say is our gap to pre-COVID isn't that different than it was. So, as the industry gets better, we're getting better. And so, we feel like we'll continue to improve. And what we've seen over the last couple of quarters is a really big improvement in turnover. So, I think people now feel like they understand how their -- what their job is and how to do it. We've actually spent a lot more time, as I said on our last call, every one of our General Manager, managing partner conferences in August, talked about how to make our each whatever brand a better place to work -- an even better place to work. It was already a great place to work. And those things are bearing fruit. So, our turnover is getting better. Our first 90-day turnover is significantly improved from where it was just six months ago because of the focus that we're putting on training and making sure that those team members feel up to speed before they get thrown out on a busy Friday.\nBrian Vaccaro: All right. Great. That's helpful. And I guess my quick follow-up, just on pricing, Raj, I heard your comments on your expectation for the fiscal fourth quarter. But could you let us know how much have you taken or how much did you take in the fiscal third quarter or have planned to take in the fourth quarter? And just thinking with a little more pressure on commodities, has your thinking changed on sort of the arc of your pricing and how quickly you might look to let that moderate over the next few quarters? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Brian, I think I'm not going to comment on past Q4, but I will tell you that if you look at where the pricing has been, second quarter was 6.5%, third quarter that we just completed was 6.3%, we expect fourth quarter to be under 6%. So the peak pricing for us on an annual basis is behind us. I think it's going -- unless something dramatically changes, we see pricing coming down. And I can -- and I know not to compare to some -- everybody else, but the -- when you look at what's happening in the market, I think most people are on an upward trend on pricing. We think we're actually from here on a downward trend. And -- but overall, though, that's actually translating into the results we've talked about. And then when we started the year, we started with 100 basis points -- target of roughly pricing below inflation for this year of about 100 basis points. I expect us to end in that range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Parke with Wells Fargo. \nJohn Parke: I guess there's been a lot of focus on trade down to low end, but I guess are you guys seeing any signs that that middle income consumer is moving more into like your value brands and coming a bit more? \nRick Cardenas: Yes, John. We really haven't seen a whole lot of change in mix across of our brands. And I would say value brands versus not, if you look at our release today, we had same restaurant sales ranges between the different segments between I think it was 10.8% and 11.7%. So three of our segments I think actually had 11.7% comp. And our total comp for the company was 11.7%. So it's very consistent across. And all of our brands had very, very strong same restaurant sales. \nJohn Parke: Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. At this time we have no further questions in queue. I will now turn the call back over to Kevin Kalicak for any additional or closing remarks.\nKevin Kalicak: Great. Thanks Todd. That concludes our call for today. I would like to remind you that we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 22nd before the market opens, with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in the call today. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raj Vennam",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone. We had high expectations for the third quarter sales growth as we were wrapping on last January's Omicron outbreak and several weeks of severe winter weather that combined to reduce sales by over $100 million in the third quarter of last year. Exceeded those high expectations, posting record total sales of $2.8 billion, which was 13.8% higher than last year, driven by 11.7% same-restaurant sales growth along with the addition of 35 net new restaurants. This same restaurant sales performance outpaced the industry by 450 basis points, and our same-restaurant guest counts performed even more as they exceeded the industry benchmark by 700 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.34, an increase of 21.2% above last year. Total EBITDA was $448 million, and we returned $272 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter, consisting of $148 million in dividends and $124 million in share repurchases. Total pricing for the quarter was approximately 6.3%, 70 basis points below total inflation of roughly 7%. Now looking at our margin performance compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses rose 110 basis points, driven by commodities inflation of approximately 9%, which was higher than we anticipated going into the quarter and significantly outpaced pricing of 6.3%. Chicken, dairy and grains continue to be categories experiencing the highest levels of inflation, but each improved versus prior quarter as we expected. However, beef inflation increased from the second quarter level and drove the majority of our higher-than-anticipated commodities inflation this quarter. Restaurant labor was 120 basis points better than last year as we benefited from sales leverage and our restaurants continue to run efficient labor despite hourly wage inflation of 8%. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7%. Restaurant expenses were 40 basis points favorable to last year as we leveraged higher sales that more than offset elevated inflation on utilities as well as higher repairs and maintenance expense. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points lower than last year, driven by sales leverage. G&A expenses were 40 basis points higher than last year, driven by the timing of our incentive compensation accrual and other expenses. Operating income margin of 12.6% was 30 basis points better than last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%, and we ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $287 million. Now looking at our margin performance versus pre COVID, we grew operating income by 70 basis points, while underpricing inflation by more than 400 basis points since pre-COVID. Increased food and beverage costs were more than offset by improved productivity, reduced marketing and other cost savings initiatives. Looking at our segment performance. All of our segments significantly outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. Sales at Olive Garden grew 13.9% above last year, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 12.3%. Average weekly sales at Olive Garden were 108% of pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 22.5% was 150 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage and labor efficiencies. LongHorn sales grew 13.5% above last year, with same-restaurant sales growth of 10.8%. Average weekly sales at LongHorn were 127% of the pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 17.4% was 80 basis points below last year, driven by elevated commodities inflation. Sales in our Fine Dining segment grew 13.2% over last year driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 11.7% and average weekly sales were 113% of the pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 21.8% and was 110 basis points below last year, driven by elevated commodities inflation. Our other segment sales grew 14.1% above last year with the same restaurant sales growth of 11.7% and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-COVID level. Segment profit margin of 14% was 20 basis points better than last year, driven by sales leverage and labor efficiencies. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We have increased our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of $10.45 billion to $10.5 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 6.5% to 7%, approximately 55 new restaurant openings, capital spending between $550 million to $575 million, total inflation of 7% to 7.5% and annual pricing of 6% to 6.5%. Furthermore, we expect commodities inflation between 9.5% and 10%, the annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 123 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year, all resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.85 and $8. This outlook implies fourth quarter sales between $2.73 billion and $2.78 billion, same-restaurant sales between 3% and 5%, diluted net earnings per share between $2.43 and $2.58. It also implies higher commodities inflation than we last communicated. We now expect commodities inflation that is solidly in the low-single-digit range for the fourth quarter versus the closer to flat estimate we shared with you on the last earnings call. Increase in commodities inflation is primarily due to higher-than-anticipated beef costs. For fiscal 2024, we anticipate opening 50 to 55 new restaurants and capital spending between $300 million and $325 million related to new restaurants and another $200 million to $225 million related to ongoing restaurant maintenance, refresh and technology spending. And while we don't normally provide a commodity outlook this early for the next fiscal year, we are anticipating low-single-digit inflation for the total commodities basket in fiscal 2024 led by high single-digit inflation on beef and produce. We expect all other categories to range from slight deflation to low single-digit inflation. With that, I'd like to close by saying that we continue to be very proud of how our teams are managing their businesses to deliver strong results in this dynamic environment. Now, we'll open it up for questions. Hey Chris, this is Raj. Good morning. So, when we actually look at our underlying traffic trends versus pre-COVID, excluding the noise from holidays and weather and promotions, they've actually been fairly stable month-to-month and that has continued into the fourth quarter. And basically, everything we know of the quarter-to-date is incorporated in our guidance. But when you step back and look at versus pre-COVID, it's pretty stable. Yes. Chris, I think the way we think about pricing is we look at total inflation. And I think as we talked about, over the last three years, we've underpriced inflation by over 400 basis points. And also, we've underpriced full-service CPI by over 600 basis points. So, we created a significant gap between our competitors, and it positions us well as we head into the next year. We'll share more thoughts on our fiscal 2024 pricing plans the next -- in the June call. Well, I think we've talked about inflation being one of the big things, right? When you look at construction costs have gone up quite a bit, especially when you compare it to pre-COVID, and we're ramping up growth. So, we do have -- I think this year, we said we're approximately 55 new units and then we talked about next year kind of in that 50 to 55 as well. So, it's really a function of the increase in construction costs. I think on the construction cost front, especially the FF&E for new restaurants has been growing quite a bit. And so that's -- it's -- you're seeing a 25-plus-percent increase in those costs related to pre-COVID. So those are really the big drivers. But having said that, given the improvements we've made to our business models and where our unit economics are, we still have pretty strong returns on our new units, and we continue to want to grow that. And that's why we do want to try to target as much growth as we can. Now, we're going to be disciplined in how we do that. But we have -- we're being a little bit more selective, but still, we feel like we have opportunity to take share. Yes. David, I think we have -- basically, we're going to be under 6%. So call it, 5.5% to 6% is probably what we're running or expect to be running in Q4. Hey Jeff. It's actually what you said. It's the commodities inflation. We did -- as we said last call, we thought Q4 was going to be flat, closer to flat. And then now that we're saying that's in the -- solidly in the low single digits. So, when you kind of layer that in, that's where the growth is a little bit less. But outside of -- that's really the primary dynamic that's different. Yes. So a couple of things. The new units, I think we talked about, part of it is just the construction delays and the challenges we've had. And we are still opening quite a few. I mean, our expectation for this year is approximately 55 new openings. So, we're opening quite a bit. As far as the comment on the returns, when we look at our new units actually -- especially the recent openings have actually outperformed on the top line more than we expected going into. So, they are actually opening at most of our brands. They're opening at volumes that are exceeding what we would have estimated going into the -- when we approved the capital for the project. So overall, we always had a lot of headroom in our -- in terms of the returns versus our cost of capital. And so, we are exceeding the hurdle by a wide margin even with the increased construction cost. Yes. Dennis, I think we've talked about this year -- we've been purposeful and deliberate in actually choosing to price where we price, right, over the last few years because of the gains we have had versus pre-COVID. Our intent would be to try to grow from these levels. But in a given year, it can be different. Ultimately, we do go back to that 10% to 15% TSR. That's the EPS growth plus the dividend yield. And how we get there, any given year might be different. But from where we are starting at the end of this fiscal year, we expect to build margins over time. Yes. I think you're going to see a little bit more of Olive Garden openings just because they have the best returns in the portfolio, and they have -- we've shared that we think there is more opportunity for growth coming out of the pandemic. So, you might see 20ish in for them and then mid-teens for LongHorn and then everybody else making up the rest. Yes. We always focus on -- that's the opportunity for us. When we talk about our scale benefiting, we always are trying to take costs that are not directly impacting the guest. So, that's really restaurant expenses and G&A are the two places where we think our scale benefits us the most in terms of being able to take costs out, leverage our scale. And so, we do expect those to continue to be -- maintain a wider gap to pre-COVID, positive gap. Yes. That's right. Hey Brian, any given quarter, I think the brand to brand, it's a function of the pricing versus inflation. So, if you look at -- and frankly, as I mentioned, in the third quarter, beef was the biggest surprise, right? So for instance, our LongHorn and to some extent, our Fine Dining brands, they weren't prepared for that level of inflation. So the pricing hadn't been in place. And like I said in the past, the way we think about pricing is we're not going to overreact to near-term fluctuations. We kind of think about what's truly the more secure part of the inflation and try to price for it. And so, there was a little bit of really noise on that front this quarter that impacted the other segments. With that said, Olive Garden is our largest brand. I mean, that is -- it makes up over 50% of our sales and 55% or more of that profit. So for us to grow, you got to see Olive Garden to have some growth, or it takes a lot of heavy lifting from everybody else to make up. But the other thing with Olive Garden was we did -- some of the costs did moderate from where they were in the second quarter. So if you recall, second quarter, it was the other way around where the margins were deteriorating. And the third piece is Olive Garden was disproportionately impacted by Omicron last year. We talked about that last year. Now, as we wrap on it, they're benefiting from some of that. There were labor inefficiencies last year, so -- especially for them because of their geography and because of the demographic mix of their gas, it hurt them most and now you're seeing them outperform the most. Yes. Brian, I think that's -- so obviously, as you mentioned, sales is the biggest part, but we are seeing turnover get better. And I think we called out last year, we had a lot of sick pay and some inefficiencies in labor last year because of Omicron. And so that's actually also helping. But you do see a quarter-to-quarter improvement, right? I mean, I think we progressed by over 100 basis points from second quarter to third quarter. And that's really the function of sales delta. We had almost $300 million more in sales, and that helps with a lot of leverage. And then the last piece, as I said earlier, is the retention is getting better, and that helps with improved productivity. Yes, Brian, I think I'm not going to comment on past Q4, but I will tell you that if you look at where the pricing has been, second quarter was 6.5%, third quarter that we just completed was 6.3%, we expect fourth quarter to be under 6%. So the peak pricing for us on an annual basis is behind us. I think it's going -- unless something dramatically changes, we see pricing coming down. And I can -- and I know not to compare to some -- everybody else, but the -- when you look at what's happening in the market, I think most people are on an upward trend on pricing. We think we're actually from here on a downward trend. And -- but overall, though, that's actually translating into the results we've talked about. And then when we started the year, we started with 100 basis points -- target of roughly pricing below inflation for this year of about 100 basis points. I expect us to end in that range."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter on both the top and bottom line. We significantly exceeded the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic, outperforming more on traffic than we did on sales. We also continued to underprice inflation, resulting in lower overall check growth relative to the industry. Our ability to make this investment and provide strong value to our guests reinforces the power of our strategy, which comes to life through our four competitive advantages and executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy. I am particularly proud of the way our restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level by being brilliant with the basics. This intense focus on providing great food, service and atmosphere enables them to consistently create memorable guest experiences. During the holiday season, Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse set new all-time weekly sales records, only to break them during Valentine's week. In fact, all of our brands achieved record total sales for the quarter. Of course, none of this would be possible without having the right people in the right roles ready to serve our guests. Our restaurants continue to be well staffed and our manager staffing remains at historic highs. Our leaders work hard to ensure each of our restaurants is a great place to work. During the quarter, several of our brands were recognized as industry leaders by Black Box Intelligence. LongHorn and Eddie V's received the Best Practices Award, which evaluates the brand's employee retention as well as sales and traffic performance. Olive Garden, The Capital Grille and Seasons 52 were honored with the Employer of Choice Award, which is based on workforce data, including employee turnover and gender and racial diversity. We know from our recent engagement survey results that our overall level of engagement is very high, and our team members understand what is expected of them at work. This is helping drive high guest satisfaction metrics, both internally and externally. Data from the American Customer Satisfaction Index shows customer satisfaction is down across all industries. However, across all of our brands, our internal guest satisfaction ratings remain exceptionally strong. In fact, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Yard House and Bahama Breeze achieved all-time highs during the quarter. Additionally, for the second consecutive quarter, the Darden brand was ranked number one among major casual dining brands in each measurement category within Technomic's industry tracking tool. Even with the traffic growth we achieved during the quarter, to-go sales remained strong, accounting for 26% of total sales at Olive Garden, 14% at LongHorn and 12% at Cheddar's. We continue to leverage technology to make it easier to order a pick up and pay without having to pass the added expense of third-party delivery on to our guests. Our teams are executing the off-premise experience at a high level. For example, to-go orders accounted for 33% of Olive Garden's total sales on Valentine's Day, and they significantly improved their ratings for both on-time and order accuracy for that day. For the quarter, digital transactions accounted for more than 62% of all off-premise sales and 10% of Darden's total sales. Finally, we opened 7 new restaurants during the quarter across 7 states. Our new restaurant opening teams continue to do an excellent job of hiring and training new team members and successfully opening these locations. We are on track to open 25 net new restaurants during the fourth quarter, and I am confident in our ability to do so because of our well-prepared leadership pipeline and the tremendous support teams we have in place. We are fortunate to have the best team members in the industry, and I am proud of the focus and commitment they continue to display. On behalf of our senior leadership team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank all of our team members for everything you do to nourish and delight our guests and each other. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Hey Brian, this is Rick. Let's talk about our staffing. As we mentioned on our call, we're very well staffed. We have more managers per restaurant than we've ever had in our history. So, we feel really good about where we are. We're not going to talk necessarily about what our wage growth will be next year. I will say that even before COVID, wage inflation was in the mid-signal-digit. So, we will continue to work with whatever the economy comes our way and however we can handle that. But we have a great employment proposition. Our turnover is significantly reducing. It's getting closer to our pre-COVID levels. And we still think we've got room to improve our turnover. We're hiring great people and we're being as discerning as we had been before COVID. So, we feel really good about where we are. And we'll talk about our inflation targets and our pricing and all of those things in June. Yes. David, let's talk about the macro for the macro consumer. But if you think about where our guide is for the next quarter, if you look at it versus pre-COVID, you take out the Omicron change and the Never-Ending Pasta Bowl change that we did in Q2. When you think about pre-COVID, our trends are very similar, even what we're thinking about for Q4. So -- but as you think about the state of the consumer and the state of the economy, we've said this in previous calls, there's been a shift in spending from durable goods to services, restaurant businesses are benefiting from that. What's interesting is, for most of calendar year 2022, customer sentiment was pretty bad, but consumer spending was significantly high. So even though they were thinking that things were bad, they were still spending. And so, we think as long as the unemployment rate is low and wages are increasing, consumers should continue to spend. Casual dining same-restaurant sales improved sequentially each quarter during the fiscal year and our positive gap to the industry improved, especially in traffic. So, we feel like what we're doing is really helping us. I will also say the data from our proprietary brand health tracker suggests that most consumers are not pulling back from restaurant visits and they do not appear to be trading down from full service to limited service based on the data that we have. Now there is a tension between what people want and what they can afford. Consumers continue to seek value, which is not about low prices, consumers are making spending trade-offs. And food away from home is one of the most difficult expenses to give up because going out to a restaurant is still an affordable luxury for them. And so, what does that mean for us? For our brands, we believe that operators that can deliver on their brand promise and value will continue to appeal to consumers, despite economic challenges. And that's what we remain focused on doing, no matter what happens in the industry and whatever happens to the category. Yes. Jeff, this is Rick. The interest rates really aren't making a huge impact in our business. We actually have a significant balance in cash. So, higher interest rates has actually given us a little bit more interest over time. You think about our new restaurant openings that we have seen inflation, as Raj mentioned. And so, we're being prudent in looking at some of these deals and saying, you know what, we might wait just a little bit of time to see if we can get a second bid sometimes during this year, we're only getting one bid for some of these sites. So we want to be prudent. But the interest rates really haven't done anything for us. And if you think about the consumer, they're still spending. We'll see what happens when these credit card balances, which were at record highs in December, come due, but they're still spending today. So, so far, nothing in our space. As it pertains to return of cash, we have a very strong dividend as we announced it again today. We feel like that's one way we return our cash to shareholders. We'll talk about our capital returns coming up in June. But it hasn't really changed our outlook and what we think about our long-term framework. So, if you go back to our framework and how we return cash to shareholders, we've got targets for our rough dividend as a percent of our earnings and how much we buy back in shares. This year, we've bought back somewhere in the $400-and-some-odd million and our share count target that we gave you would imply a little bit more in the fourth quarter. But we'll talk more about our return on cash and our long-term framework in June. Well, Jeff, I think if you think about March, when you think, volatility will happen in March just because of shifts in spring break. So you have to take that into account. But trends are fairly consistent. So, when you think about a state might change where the spring break is. So, that will show volatility at restaurants. But in general, we feel like our trends haven't really changed much. Hey Josh, this is Rick. We're not going to get into too much detail on our promotional plans, but I would say that our marketing spend isn't going to be significantly different year-over-year. It might be 10 to 20 basis points either way, up or down as we think about next year. But as we've said before, advertising is always going to be part of Olive Garden's mix because of the scale advantage they have. And so, we'll continue to leverage that scale advantage with Olive Garden. And we'll use the filters that we mentioned before, to evaluate any marketing activity, elevating -- it has to elevate brand equity. It has to be simple to execute, and it's not going to be at a deep discount. And so, we plan on sticking to that strategy. But if things dramatically change, we'll react accordingly. And as we've said many times in the past, if and when we increase our marketing spend, we'd expect it to earn a return compared to where we would have been without it. So, it should be a positive ROI, and it shouldn't impact our -- it shouldn't hurt our margins. Yes, Josh. The manager role in our restaurants is the most important role we have, especially the general manager, the managing partner. And being fully staffed there gives them more time to spend with their team and train their team, develop them, make them stronger and just spend that time forecasting their business and spending time with guests. If you're under staff managers, the restaurant doesn't run as well. But the other thing about being fully staffed with managers and have the highest staffing in our history is that that helps us open restaurants going forward, right? If you think about our pipeline of new units, we have about 25 net openings coming in this quarter, and we are ready for it with the managers that we have. So, there's a lot of benefits of being fully staffed managers can spend more time with their team, they can spend more time with guests, and we have the managers to open our restaurants. Well, our strategy has been this strategy for quite a while, and we plan on sticking to it. It's really helped us over the long term on whether inflation has been high or inflation has been low. If inflation comes down or things slow down, a lot of our pricing is already built in for next year based on where we are right now. And so, we'll be able to react accordingly. In the long run, we plan on pricing below inflation. But in any 12-month period, it might be a little bit higher, a little bit lower than inflation. That said, we believe that our scale advantage gives us the opportunity to find cost savings so that we can price below inflation in the long run, to drive a better value for our guests. And as we said earlier, guests appreciate value, especially when or if the economy slows down a little bit, they go for places that they get a great value and they get great consistent experiences, and that's what we intend to provide. Yes. In the past, we had talked about our lower income consumer, over the last few quarters, the mix shifting down a little bit, but still being above pre-COVID. The good news is we haven't seen a material change in mix from the last time we talked to now in that lower end consumer. But if it manifests itself, it generally starts with managing check. Generally, consumers will manage their check first, and then they'll manage their visits later. And so far, we really haven't seen a whole lot of check management. So, that tells you, based on what I said earlier, consumer sentiment was pretty bad in '22, but consumers still spent. And as people shifted to restaurants, we benefited. So, we haven't seen it yet. We may see it. And when we do, it will start at check probably and then it will impact probably more likely impact our lower-end consumer brands, not that they're lower end brands, they just have a bigger mix of lower-end consumers, and it will impact less our high-end brands. But that's the benefit of a portfolio and the portfolio that we have that we can withstand shocks to one segment of the population. Yes. Andrew, this is Rick. I will say that if you think about our confidence returning a TSR of 10% to 15% in any one year, we've said many times that in any one year, it could be below that or above that. And remember that's earnings growth and dividend yield. I will say, go back in our history since we've been a public company, we've never had a 10-year period that we have had less than a 10-year -- 10% annualized total shareholder return. So, we feel confident over the long run that we're going to get to 10% to 15%. We're not going to talk about next year. But I would feel like we're pretty confident we should be able to get there. Yes. Jon, this is Rick. What we said earlier is most customers aren't. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't any customers shifting from full-service to limited service, but most aren't. And we're not really seeing that in our results. So, others might be, but what we have been doing is providing a great value. We've actually taken a lot less pricing than most of our competition. So, that might be a reason that others might be seeing that when we're not. And we're improving our guest experience. So, at the same time that we've taken pricing that was lower than inflation by Raj said, 400 or 500 basis points versus pre-COVID, we've been improving our experience. Our customer satisfaction is growing. We've had records at Cheddar's and Yard House, as I mentioned already. So, I think that's what people will crave when environments get a little bit tougher. They crave things that provide them a great value. And that gives them a consistent experience. And we've been doing that, and we'll continue to do that. No, I'm not suggesting that it's only our brands. What I'm saying is that most consumers aren't trading down. Some are, but most aren't. And in prior big downturns or things like that, we had a lot -- we had a lot more consumers trade down. We haven't seen that. Now, when I talk about specifically to our brands, our satisfaction is up. Our value is better than it was before. So, there's a little bit of both in my answer, industry and us. Hey John, it's Rick. We're not necessarily going to talk about specific triggers. What I can say is we're going to be very prudent in our marketing spend. We've done a lot over the last few years to simplify our business to make it easier to operate and we've done a lot of testing during this time on what marketing really does drive. And when things change dramatically, we may change. But right now, we're going to continue to stick to our strategy of making our communication be much more branded, elevating brand equity, simple to execute, and we don't expect it to be a deep discount. So, we've -- this industry has gone through this before, buying guests, and we're not ones that are going to go out and buy guests. We're going to continue to do what we do and strengthen our business. And if things change, then we may react. Yes John, thanks. It's Rick. One of the things I want to let everybody make sure they hear is we're not going to risk margin, significant margin declines because of what happens in the economy. If food costs go down, think about what we've said in the past, a 1% decline in commodity inflation will offset a 2% decline in traffic, all else equal, with us doing nothing. So if commodity costs come down and inflation comes down, we can weather a little bit of a traffic decline and still get to the same EBITDA. So, I think we have to think -- and the industry has to think long term about how they drive traffic through discounting. And we have made that shift and we made that shift, even started it before COVID to drive traffic through better experiences, better overall value and not discounting to a very small -- a small portion of our guest base. So, that's our strategy going forward. If things change, we'll let you know. Hey Chris, I would say that I don't think it's just this quarter. I think it's been a long time what we've been doing. We've been underpricing inflation. Even before COVID, we started underpricing inflation, and we've been putting more on the plate. And so, we've actually invested while underpricing. And so, if you look at variable margin, contribution margin, just take Olive Garden, for example, you can't do the math. But if you look at contribution margin in Olive Garden, it's lower today than it was before COVID. But their margins [indiscernible] are up. So our consumers are seeing that they're getting more value when they come into the restaurants, and that doesn't take -- it doesn't take a week to figure that out. It takes them a long time to figure that out. And that's why when we talk about what we're doing, you have to think about this over the long run because we're not shouting out to the rooftops that we've done this. The closest that we did to that was brought Never-Ending Pasta Bowl back at a $3 higher price to show people that we still have some great value in our restaurants, and Olive Garden being on TV talking about the things that make their brand special. Right now, where we've got back on our advertising and sauces sold and talking about our freshly made cases every day, while we still have a 15-second spot talking about our never-ending first course. And so -- and that never-ending first course is on us. There aren't many brands that actually give you never-ending that for every item that you order. And so, again, it's not something that we necessarily talk about. We don't go out and shout from the rooftops that we have lower prices than others do or we've priced less. They see it as they come into our restaurants, and that builds over time. What I would say is versus pre-COVID, our data would tell us that -- that we're getting a little bit younger than we were before COVID across all of our brands, and that's somewhat driven by an increase in to go business. But the great news is a lot of these folks had actually used us for to go for the first time, and that's their first visit to us, are actually starting to come into our restaurant, too. So it was kind of a handshake to come in. And so we're slightly younger, but our consumer segments are fairly similar to what they were before. And that's great news for us. We're also getting a little bit more frequency in our core guests. And that's really what we've been focusing on. So, the good news is our consumers are not that different. They're slightly younger. That means that we don't have to really change what we're doing because we can keep talking to our consumers just like we have been before. Hey Katherine, this is Rick. You probably see it just as much as we do. But I can tell you that there's a big competitor that just went back on TV and they talked about it before, they did it. And you've got some of these other competitors that are out there a little bit more on television than they were before. That said, Olive Garden still is usually in the top 2 or 3 of advertising spend in our space, and we're doing that through branded kind of advertising versus deals. Andrew, this is Rick. Let me start by saying that satisfaction at Olive Garden and LongHorn are significantly high, and our other brands, our fine owning brands are very high. And so it takes a little bit more to move them up significantly versus what we've seen at Cheddar's and Yard House. Cheddar's and Yard House and others have made significant improvements to their brand, significant improvements to service and significant improvement to value, and customers see that. And so, we've had great performance at our -- at those brands that I mentioned, having record highs. But I wouldn't tell you that the others aren't at or near their records. It's just Cheddar's and Yard House actually made a record this quarter. I think we always look at what -- where we have opportunities within menus, within brands, within regions of the country, and we will never stop. What I would tell you is we feel really good about where our pricing is, and we feel really good that we've been able to price well below what most of our competitors have done. And that gives us, as Raj said, some room to take a little bit more pricing if we want to take a little bit more pricing. And so, we will always look, and we generally try to price restaurants into strength and not into weakness, and we have a lot of great data scientists here that help us look at that. And we also talk to our operators and get their perspective. So that won't change no matter what happens in the economy or what happens with others. We'll continue to do what we do, and we feel like we've earned the right to keep doing what we've done. Yes. David, I don't want to talk necessarily about the second half of fiscal -- of calendar '23 because that's fiscal '24 for us. But I think if you look back in history and you look back in other slowdowns, if that is what happens, and you look at some of our brands, Olive Garden significantly outperformed during that time because guests go for -- where they see value and they go to trusted brands, and I think Olive Garden is one of the most trusted brands out there. So, we would expect that we could outperform. I can't say we will, but I think we -- I think that's what our history would stay. And so, we're going to look at our marketing mix just like we've done in the last few years, and we may move it a couple of tenths here or there. But unless something dramatically changes, we don't anticipate doing anything differently. Yes, David. I would say when we bought Cheddar's, we thought they had a lot of opportunities ahead of them. We still believe they have a lot of opportunities ahead of them. And we're going to be prudent on their growth as we make sure that they have the leadership teams for their restaurant to grow. I said it at ICR that the world is littered with brands that grew too fast, and we're very, very strategic on how we open our -- grow our brands. And so, the days of 10-plus percent growth for a brand at Darden, that doesn't happen very much. And so with Cheddar's, we're going to be prudent. We're going to open in the single digits for a little while to see how they continue to do. And as we infill markets that they already have restaurants in, and we find ways to get into new markets, as long as we have the people to do it, we can grow them. And I will tell you that John Wilkerson and his team have done a great job developing their people to have people ready to open these restaurants. And the more pipeline we have of people, the faster we can open. Hey Lauren, this is Rick. 700 basis points of outperformance is pretty strong. It all really depends on what the total traffic growth is for the industry. If we do -- if the industry is growing at 1%, do we expect to get 7% every quarter in outperformance, no? And if anybody would say that, I think that's thinking a little bit too hard. We're very pleased with that outperformance of 700 basis points this quarter, but we wouldn't expect to be 700 basis points every quarter. And there might be quarters that we have lower performance and traffic than our competition. But we think about this over the long term. And over the long term, we expect to outperform. I don't want to get into the detail on calls we're getting or valuations we're getting. All I can say is we've said before, biggest competitive advantage we have is our scale. And one of the ways to build that scale is to buy other brands. And as volatility reduces, price discovery improves. And so, that's what we've got to continue to think about. And interest rates have made some change. So, we still feel like we'll talk to our Board when the right opportunities come to play, and we'll be ready when they do. Hey Greg, thanks for the question. What I would say, first of all, is we've got that long-term framework of 10 to 30 basis points of margin expansion. We had significant margin expansion during COVID. And we talked about it last year that we'd probably give some of that back this year. So, we had significant expansion during COVID of over 200 basis points, I think to 250, and now we're closer to 150 pre-COVID. And so, as we think about going forward, as we get to our long-term framework and we still think our long-term framework will hold over time. And some of that will come probably at maybe a third to half of that will come below the restaurant level as we think about leveraging other costs. But as traffic grows and same-restaurant sales grow, we should still get some from the restaurant. But G&A should be some of that savings going forward. Yes. Brian, let me start by saying we've had a reduction in turnover, which has been helping us. Our team members are starting to learn more about what they do, especially the newer team members. And as I mentioned earlier, our manager staffing is at pretty high levels. And so, they can spend more time teaching their team and getting more productivity out of their team. Without getting into too much detail on turnover, our turnover is closer to pre-COVID levels than COVID levels. And we would intend to get it back towards those levels. What I would also say is our gap to pre-COVID isn't that different than it was. So, as the industry gets better, we're getting better. And so, we feel like we'll continue to improve. And what we've seen over the last couple of quarters is a really big improvement in turnover. So, I think people now feel like they understand how their -- what their job is and how to do it. We've actually spent a lot more time, as I said on our last call, every one of our General Manager, managing partner conferences in August, talked about how to make our each whatever brand a better place to work -- an even better place to work. It was already a great place to work. And those things are bearing fruit. So, our turnover is getting better. Our first 90-day turnover is significantly improved from where it was just six months ago because of the focus that we're putting on training and making sure that those team members feel up to speed before they get thrown out on a busy Friday. Yes, John. We really haven't seen a whole lot of change in mix across of our brands. And I would say value brands versus not, if you look at our release today, we had same restaurant sales ranges between the different segments between I think it was 10.8% and 11.7%. So three of our segments I think actually had 11.7% comp. And our total comp for the company was 11.7%. So it's very consistent across. And all of our brands had very, very strong same restaurant sales."

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.  As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation.  Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2023 third quarter earnings on Thursday, March 23, before the market opens followed by a conference call.

Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence's casual dining benchmark, excluding Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.  During our second fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales increased 3.6% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 5.7%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and our focus moving forward, and Raj will provide more details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2023 financial outlook.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\nRicardo Cardenas: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and happy holidays, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter. All of our brands performed at a high level by remaining focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere. At the Darden level, we continue to strengthen and leverage our 4 competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Being brilliant with the basics starts with achieving and maintaining appropriate staffing levels in our restaurants. Across our brands, our teams are doing a great job of ensuring we are ready to run 14 great shifts a week. At each of our brands, we are fully staffed at the team member level, and manager staffing is at historic highs. As a result, our teams are executing more consistently, which in turn is driving strong guest satisfaction across our brands, according to both internal and external sources. During the quarter, 4 of our brands achieved all-time high internal guest satisfaction ratings and the others remain near all-time highs. Also, within Technomic industry tracking tool, a Darden brand was ranked #1 among major casual dining brands in each measurement category. I am particularly proud of Olive Garden's performance. During the quarter, they brought back their most popular limited time offers, never any possible. As you may recall, when I talked last I shared that any promotional activity or brands introduced should be evaluated with the following 3 filters. First, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations which allows our teams to consistently deliver exceptional guest experiences. And third, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests, but doing that in a way that drives profitable sales growth. Three years after it was last offered, the 2022 version of never any possible checked all 3 of these boxes. First, it leveraged Olive Garden's iconic brand equity by perfectly reinforcing their competitive advantage of never-ending abundant craveable Italian food. Next, it was amplified by only offering existing menu items with limited add-on choices, which made it easier to execute, resulting in great guest experiences. Finally, it was priced $3 higher than in 2019, which significantly improved the margin of this offer while still providing tremendous value for our guests. Never ending possible exceeded expectations, and we saw a step change in Olive Garden's positive gap to industry traffic during the 7 weeks at ramp. I'm even more encouraged by this performance, given that it was supported with about 3/4 of the media past years. Going forward, the team will build on their learnings and share insights across our brands but this may be the only limited time offer we do at Olive Garden this fiscal year. Across our brands, we continue to drive strong execution of the off-premise guest experience through ongoing investments in technology that reduce friction for our guests and our operators. For example, many of our guests still prefer to call in their to-go order. However, taking payment over the phone or when the guests arrived is both inefficient for our teams and inconvenient for our guests. To help address this, we rolled out online payment for call-in orders during the quarter, enhancing convenience for our guests and making our to-go specialists more efficient. To-go sales remain sticky across our core casual dining brand, accounting for 25% of total sales at Olive Garden, 14% of Longhorn and 13% at Cheddar's. Digital transactions accounted for 62% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 10% of Darden's total sales. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams, and they have enjoyed welcoming even more guests back into their restaurants this season. In fact, the Capital Grille, ADB and CD52 enjoyed all-time daily sales record on Thanksgiving Day, and bookings for this holiday season are encouraging. The holidays are also a great reminder that being of service is at the heart of our business. and we embraced a higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve, our guests, our team members and our communities. One of the ways we serve our communities is through our harvest program. One in 8 households in our country live without consistent access to food. To help fight hunger, our restaurants donate fresh, unused food to local food banks and nonprofits in their communities on a weekly basis throughout the year. Since the inception of this program, more than 131 million pounds of food have been donated, which is the equivalent of more than 100 million meals. The impact of our harvest program takes on added significance during the holidays. And I am delighted that our teams are helping to make a difference in some in communities across the country. I'm so proud of the focus and commitment our teams continue to display. Their disciplined approach in executing on our strategy is what enables us to succeed regardless of the operating environment. This is evidenced by the fact that just last week, we surpassed $10 billion in sales on a trailing 52-week basis for the first time in Darden's history. On behalf of our senior leadership team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our 180,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guests and our communities. I wish you all a wonderful holiday season.  Now I'll turn it over to Raj.\nRajesh Vennam : Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, 9.4% higher than last year, driven by 7.3% same-restaurant sales growth along with the addition of 35 net new restaurants. This same restaurant sales performance outperformed -- outpaced the industry by 370 basis points and our same restaurant gas counts are performed even more as they exceeded the industry benchmark by 550 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.52, an increase of 2.7% above last year. Total EBITDA was $330 million, and we returned $249 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter, consisting of $149 million in dividends and $100 million in share repurchases. Total pricing for the quarter was approximately 6.5%, 200 basis points below total inflation of roughly 8.5%. Now looking at the details of the P&L compared to last year, Food and beverage expenses were 240 basis points higher, driven by commodities inflation of approximately 13%, which significantly outpaced our pricing. As we expected, chicken dairy and grains continue to be categories experiencing the highest levels of inflation. Produce especially let us was much higher than expected due to poor growing conditions and weather-related events in the quarter.  However, our scale and vendor partnerships help minimize this impact relative to the general market. National labor was 30 basis points better than last year, even with total restaurant labor inflation of 7%. Our restaurants continue to run efficient labor despite hourly wage inflation of 8.5%. National expenses were 20 basis points favorable as we leveraged higher sales that more than offset elevated inflation on utilities as well as higher repairs and maintenance expense. Marketing expenses were 30 basis points higher than last year as we increased media support for the reintroduction of never-ending possible. This was in line with our expectations heading into the quarter. G&A expenses were 40 basis points below last year, driven by sales leverage and a lower incentive accrual, which was in line with our plan. This favorability was partially offset by higher mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. And as a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line. Page 13 of our presentation illustrates the roughly 20 basis point reduction to operating income from mark-to-market expense and the 150 basis point benefit to the tax rate. The effective tax rate of 12.1% this quarter would have been 13.6% without the impact from the hedge. Now looking at our margin performance versus pre-Covid, we grew operating income margin by 160 basis points, while underpricing inflation by more than 500 basis points. Increased food and beverage costs were more than offset by improved productivity, reduced marketing, and other cost savings initiatives. Looking at our segment performance. All of our segments significantly outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. Sales at Olive Garden were 9.2% above last year driven by same-restaurant sales of 7.6%. Average weekly sales at Olive Garden were 104% of the recovery level. LongHorn sales were 9.7% above last year with same-restaurant sales growth of 7.3%. Average weekly sales at LongHorn were 125% of the pre=COVID level. Sales in our Fine Dining segment were 7% above last year, driven by Same Russian sales of 5.9% and average sales -- weekly sales were 117% of the pre-covid level. Our other segment sales were 10.5% above last year -- with same-restaurant sales of 7.1% and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-covid level. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We have updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the back half of the year. We now expect Total sales was $10.3 billion to $10.45 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 5% to 6.5%, 55 to 60 new restaurants; capital spending of $525 million to $575 million, total inflation of approximately 7%, and we plan to continue underpricing total inflation with annual pricing of approximately 6%. Furthermore, we expect commodities inflation between 8% and 9%. An annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 123 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. All resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.60 and $8. Looking at the third and fourth quarters, we expect the EPS growth rate year-over-year to be fairly balanced. In the third quarter, we estimate the outsized sales growth from lapping Omicron last year to be partially offset by underpricing inflation by approximately 50 basis points. In the fourth quarter, we expect inflation to further moderate on our pricing gap drivers contributing to margin growth. Now to wrap up, let me say that we're very pleased with how our teams are managing their businesses and delivering strong results. We remain disciplined in adhering to our strategy and providing value to our guests in the face of strong inflation. We're confident in the underlying strength of our business model and our team's ability to continue managing through this unpredictable environment effectively.  Now we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nEric Gonzalez: Just a real quick one on the promotional strategy. I think you said that never any possible will be the only LTO that you run this year. But you also brought back that $6 take-home offer, which I'm guessing you would consider to be an LTO. But -- so maybe you could talk about your expectations for that offer? Because if I remember correctly, that was a fairly strong comp driver in the past.\nRicardo Cardenas: Eric, thanks for the question. Never any possible, we said in our prepared remarks is maybe the only limited time offer, likely only been a limited time offer. As you talk about the $6 take home, that's on our core menu. So it's not considered limited time, it's on our menu. But for competitive reasons, we're not going to discuss any more promotional plan details. And so we're going to continue to use our filters that we mentioned, first, elevating brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to live; second, simple to execute; and third, not at a deep discount. As you'll probably see on ATV today, we're currently airing our open big pastas, which are core menu items for us. So they're not a limited time offer, and it includes our new Ravioli Carbonara, none of these items are discounted. So we're going to stick to our strategy, as Raj said, core growth, core discount growth, and we're going to react accordingly.\nEric Gonzalez: And then just on the marketing spend, do you still expect to be in that 1% to maybe 1.5% range for the year?\nRajesh Vennam: Yes, Eric, we're going to be close. So I think that as we said, it should be close to 1 -- we said 10 to 20 basis points above last year. That's how we think about it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co.\nBrian Bittner: Congratulations on strong results. question on Olive Garden also. The underlying same-store sales this quarter showed a clear inflection versus the last few quarters, and particularly relative to the other brands, the 3-year comp accelerated to above 11%. And how much of this dynamic would you attribute directly to bringing back never-ending possible at the strong price point you did in -- and how much would you attribute to other factors? And do you believe this kind of underlying trend on a 3-year basis is sustainable? Or should we be tiny modeling a more conservative 3-year term moving forward for Olive Garden?\nRicardo Cardenas: Yes, Brian. First, let me say how proud I handle the work Dan and his team have done working on keeping with our strategy at Olive Garden. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, Olive Garden already had a positive gap in same-restaurant sales to the industry before never-ending possible, and that gap increased when we brought never-ending possible back for 7 weeks. So it ran about half of the quarter. We're not going to kind of talk about how much nevering possible and contributed to the quarter, but it was a good jump for us. And so as we think about the rest of the year, our guidance contemplates continued strength in Olive Garden, but probably not at the strength that we had for nevering possible. Remember, this is an iconic limited time offer, uniquely positioned, and it covers all 3 filters that we mentioned. And as I said in our prepared remarks, we have exceeded our expectations. So -- and that's a pretty pleasant surprise for us. If you think about given the higher price point, the lower media support, but it does speak to how iconic that brand offer is and the things that Olive Garden brings in such a compelling way. And then finally, we haven't run in 3 years. So guests were really excited for the return, and it fits really well in our second quarter. So if you think about our lowest volume quarter of the year second quarter, never any possible helps keep our traffic a little bit higher so that we don't have to think about bringing team members hours down and then bringing team members back when the holidays go up. So we really were appreciative and we really love with the work that Olive Garden did and where nevering possible was. But not to say that our 3-year stack is going to stay the same as it did in Q2.\nBrian Bittner: And Rick, just more broadly, just you have a seat where you get to witness the consumer across multiple different brands. You have one of the best seats to kind of see how the consumer is behaving. There's obviously a lot of cross currents out there, and there's a lot of different views on where the consumer is going into calendar 2023. Can you just maybe describe your view of the consumer and how you're feeling about the overall consumer into '23 and maybe some puts and takes?\nRicardo Cardenas: Yes, Brian, I won't necessarily talk about 23. I'll just talk about what we're seeing, not being an economist, I listen to what they have to say. But as you all know, everybody on this call knows, consumer spending drives the U.S. economy. The -- we've seen a shift in spending though, from durable household goods or durable goods to leisure services, and the restaurant industry has benefited from that shift. Casual dining same-restaurant sales improved from Q1 to Q2 and our positive gap to the industry improved even more during that time. So one of the benefits of our portfolio, as you mentioned, is we have a wide range of consumers. We serve a lot of them all across all of the spectrum. And our data indicates the higher-end consumer hasn't seen the same impact as consumers at the lower end of the spectrum. But if you think about the prepared remarks, sales at Thanksgiving were a record for Fine Dining and Seasons 52 and bookings for this holiday season are encouraging. So it seems like the higher end consumer is doing pretty well. And I know there's been a lot of talk over the year about consumers that's below $50,000 in income because high inflation impacts that consumer more disproportionately, but we've seen a little softness in that consumer over the last 6 months, but the mix of the 50,000 income and under is still above pre-covid levels for us. Even though that shift has come down a little bit, we're still above pre-covid levels at the 50,000 and below. And I would say, keep in mind that a lot of our consumers below $50,000 are single, are retirees are living in multigenerational households. So maybe $50,000 goes a little bit farther for that consumer. But without commenting on the future, we have seen a pretty good performance across all of those consumers over the last few months other than the fact that the 50,000 below consumer is lower than it was 6 months ago, but still higher than it was pre.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Charles of Cowen.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Notwithstanding the strong 2Q performance and the higher fiscal 2023 guidance, but if we were to see some macro deterioration impact the industry in fiscal 2020 -- your calendar 2023, excuse me, what's kind of the pecking order or your preference of magnitude of how you'd respond to that? Should we expect perhaps a tighter taking of the belt and just more of a focus on reducing overhead? Will we expect you guys to potentially invest more in the marketing, potentially invest more to value. How do you think about the contingency plan if we were to see some deterioration in calendar 2023?\nRicardo Cardenas: Andrew This is Rick again. If we see deterioration in the calendar 2023, we always look at ways to tighten and find ways to improve productivity and improve our administrative expenses. We think we're actually really good at doing that. So if something gets really -- shifts really badly in the wrong way, we're going to find ways to at least find places to tighten. On the marketing spend, Raj talked about what our marketing spend is for the rest of this year and for the whole year. We don't anticipate making a big change in that no matter what happens over the next 6 months. We're going to continue to use the filters that we mentioned. And I will say Olive Garden, as I said before, we'll always have advertising in their mix because of their scale. But we're going to stick to our strategy of core growth. We're going to react accordingly to whatever happens. And as we've said in the past, and Raj said it too, if and when we increase our marketing spend, we'll expect it to return -- to earn a return compared to what it would have been without the spend. So we're going to -- as you've seen us in the past, we react when things happen, and we think we'll do the same thing going forward.\nAndrew Charles: Very helpful. And if I could sneak one in to Raj, what's the small step hire in CapEx guidance as you maintain new store openings? Is that construction costs were perhaps running a bit higher than expected, there are some incremental investments in technology or something else we should be thinking about?\nRajesh Vennam: It's truly inflation on the construction costs and some equipment costs as well. So it's really -- a lot of it is new restaurant related. Some is on the -- even on the facilities CapEx, there's a little bit higher inflation.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: Just a question on traffic, particularly on-premise. If you look at the industry numbers, on-premise traffic is down double digits for casual dining. And even Olive Garden is not back to where it was. I wonder how that informs your strategy? Do you feel like that's an opportunity? Or you just have to be patient, particularly with some lapsed users, maybe that under 75,000 household income user but maybe this isn't something you want to chase either. So I'm wondering how you view that as opportunity that informs the strategy.\nRicardo Cardenas: David, if you think about what we've done over the last few years, we have significantly reduced marketing spending at Olive Garden. And we've talked in the past at how that could be about a 10-point drop in traffic for us. But we're focusing on driving core users to Olive Garden, core gas versus promotional users. And so what we see as an opportunity, we've got more capacity in our restaurants than we did before. But a lot of that in-restaurant experience has moved to the off-premise experience. As you see Olive Garden still at 25% off-premise where prior to COVID, it was much lower than that. So we see it as an opportunity to continue to focus on our strategy of pricing below our competition, pricing below inflation by finding other cost savings to help offset that and give our consumers a great value so they don't need a promotional message to come in and they just get a great value every time they come.\nDavid Palmer: Actually, on your slide deck, I just had a quick question on Slide 20. Your food inflation outlook looks like it's less inflationary on many of those line items, beef, chicken, dairy oil versus what you had previously, but your food inflation outlook is still the same at 7%. Is there some offset to what we're seeing? And I'll pass it on.\nRajesh Vennam: Yes, David, it's really the fact that last 2 quarters were 15% was in the first quarter, second quarter was 13%. So as you look at the back half, really, Q3, we're thinking it's going to be mid- to high single digits and then Q4 is closer to flat. So if you do that, what that translates into on the year is closer to that 8% to 9% that's really the difference. I think when we spoke the last time, we expected a step change from the first half to the second half. And we are seeing that. However, it's not as big as we thought. It's still a pretty big change. I mean, as I just mentioned, we're going from mid-teens to high single -- mid- to high single digits as we get into Q3 and close it to flat for Q4. So pretty big change, but there were a few there are a few items that are higher than we would have expected, namely dairy, grains and produce, and quite a bit of this is weather-related and so that's actually baked into our expectations going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs.\nJared Garber: Great. Thanks for the question. I think this was the first quarter that we've seen or the largest quarter of opens at Cheddar's and maybe several years. So I just wanted to get a sense of an update on the brand. I know it's a little bit of a lower income skew there as well. So maybe some commentary on the performance there and what you're seeing from a customer standpoint and if there's anything in terms of regionality where these new units were opened. Just any update on the brand would be great.\nRicardo Cardenas: Jared, let me talk high level about chatter and talk a little bit about the opening. Cheddar's has made significant improvements in their business model. versus pre-COVID, even with significant inflation, they had a lot of productivity enhancements with the simplified menu and a streamlined menu so that we felt more comfortable opening restaurants at a quicker pace. Not only that, they have really built their leadership pipeline and have been able to staff all of these restaurants with managing partners that have run Cheddar's, and we have a pipeline of more ready to go as we open restaurants. So yes, this was our highest quarter of openings for Cheddar's. We opened 7 restaurants.\nRajesh Vennam: Yes, versus last year. We had 7 restaurants versus last year at Cheddar's 4 in the quarter. And we -- those restaurants are performing really well. So they're primarily in markets close to where Cheddar's already exists. It's not like we're -- we have a lot of restaurants opening in brand-new markets. But we are looking at newer markets to open Cheddar's in. But as we mentioned early on in the acquisition of Cheddar's, we thought we had more room to infill markets that they already have restaurants. So that helps us leverage our scale in those markets that helps us leverage our supply chain and our people.\nRicardo Cardenas: But again, high level, really proud of the work that JW and his team have done at Cheddar's, really proud of the progress they've made in staffing their restaurants, building their pipeline, and we're seeing some pretty strong performance in these new restaurants.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Harbor of Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Harbor: Maybe just to follow up quickly on the commodity comments. Do you see any kind of risk to the second half just based on some of those items that are -- have kind of surprised to the upside recently? Or are those things that can't necessarily be contracted? How do you feel about that at this point?\nRajesh Vennam: I think there's always risk. As you think about, that's why we have a range of 8% to 9% as our assumption going in. We'll have to see how this plays out, right? I mean some of the stuff, like I have mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, Q2, the impact on product produce especially led us -- no one expected that. It came out of nowhere. It was weather related. There were 2 hurricanes and Florida, 2 hurricanes in Mexico, they just really destroyed the crops. And that cycle stuff is always a risk. We contemplated some of that in our guidance.\nBrian Harbor: Okay. And then you made the comment about just sharing some of the lessons from never ending possible at your other brands. What are you thinking about there? Is it kind of a change to promotional architecture? Or are there things you\u2019re not doing at some of those brands that you could be doing to kind of echo never in possible?\nA \u2013Ricardo Cardenas: Yes. As you think about never ending possible, there were other things that we did during that time. We did a little bit more digital testing and those kind of things that we can leverage across our brands. But \u2013 more importantly, those filters that we use on what we\u2019re going to communicate. We\u2019re very strong and helped our brand \u2013 helped Olive Garden continue to build their business, elevating brand equity, very important, and we\u2019ve learned that, simplified the offer. We\u2019ve learned that and not a V discount. So all the investments we\u2019ve made over the last few years to price below what the consumers are seeing in inflation means that we don\u2019t have to really go into the net discounting range \u2013 the never-ending possible was $3 more expensive than it was in the past, and it was still a strong promotion for us. But that\u2019s not to say that everybody is going to be on television now, right? So Olive Garden is the 1 that has the real scale to be on television. The other brands have learned things about the digital testing that we did and just the fact of the construct of the promotion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird.\nDavid Tarantino: My question is on unit development and your comment, Raj, about construction costs escalating. And I just wondered if you could comment specifically on the returns you're getting on the recent openings or the expected returns you're getting on your upcoming openings? I know there's a lot of moving parts and I guess the main question is, is the numerator of the return equation keeping up with the escalation in the denominator? And are you seeing similar returns? Or are you getting to a point where the returns are starting to come down? Any color there would be great.\nRajesh Vennam: Yes, David, let me start by saying pretty much on average. Our new restaurants exceed cost of capital by quite a bit. We had a big margin to begin with. Now the construction costs have gone up, so have our unit economics. So if you look at overall performance of where we are, I just mentioned earlier, our operating income this quarter was 160 basis points higher than pre COVID. So our 4-wall unit level economics have gotten better that helps mitigate some of the construction cost increases. Now with that said, we already -- we obviously want to continue to maintain the pace of opening. But we continue to monitor inflation in construction costs. And we are being very disciplined. There are a few times where we have walked away from some deals because the cost was too high even though that would have probably exceeded our cost of capital. We're just being a little bit more selective on that front. Now all that said, we're starting to see some green shoots on the construction side. The last few bids, I think, were more closer to or below -- slightly below elevated budget. But at least it's a positive sign. So we think there are -- there's some -- potentially this could lead to some decrease in the level of inflation over time.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. And I guess a follow-up to that is, are there projects going on inside the company to try to trim costs out of the box I know -- I think a prior question commented, the dine-in traffic has been softer for the industry. Are you thinking about building smaller dining rooms or anything of that nature to get the cost equation down?\nRicardo Cardenas: David, as we think about our prototype designs for the future, we always look for ways to trim costs out of our prototypes and find new ways to build the new materials to use. We have built some slightly smaller prototypes or at all of our brands, not necessarily because of the to-go versus the dining room but because it makes it to go experience a little easier by shifting where that to-go area is. Remember, the dining room is the least expensive part of the building. right? So if you really want to take a lot of the cost out of the building, you got to take the cost out of the kitchen. And we think we've got a great kitchen, but we'll find ways to rightsize the prototypes for the market that they're in. without overcomplicating so that we have 50 different prototypes. But we, as I said, our development team is focusing on finding the most efficient building in the markets that we compete in. We've also taken some existing sites as restaurants have closed or their leases have expired for other brands. we've actually gone in and infilled those restaurants, which are slightly less expensive because you don't have some of the framing costs and some of the plumbing. So it helps us in that respect.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Curious as it relates to pricing, if you could speak a bit more to kind of what you've seen to date as it relates to the customer response to the pricing, obviously, with the strong sales trends, I'm assuming not a whole lot, but any thoughts with respect to resistance or customer feedback to pricing and how that impacts how you think about pricing going forward?\nRajesh Vennam: Dennis, I think the reaction is not that dissimilar to historical meaning we are getting a pretty decent flow-through from pricing north of 90%. And so really not seeing any major pushback. We haven't seen any moderation on the check mix. There have been things here and there where maybe advertiser pricing, we may not have gotten the exact level of flow-through. But overall, when you look big picture, it doesn't look like there's a lot of resistance. Now we are pricing a lot less than our competitors. So I don't know what is happening with the industry itself, but our pricing is well below the industry. And maybe that's part of what -- why we're not seeing a lot of existence.\nDennis Geiger: Great. I appreciate that, Raj. And just one more. Just wondering if you could speak a bit more to the staffing situation and the execution in restaurant. I think very encouraging that you spoke to being fully staffed, manager staffing levels at all-time highs, feedback scores from the customers sounds strong. But as it relates to the level of execution currently versus the potential, is there anything with respect to maybe the 10-year of your average employee right now, may be shorter than pre-COVID that can build going forward? Anything there as it relates to where operations are now versus maybe where you would -- where they can go or where you'd like them to go.\nRicardo Cardenas: Dennis, we have a lower tenure today than we did before COVID because of the turnover over the time through COVID. Our turnover is still elevated from the pre-Covid levels, but it's getting better and it's getting -- we're working on getting it closer to what our pre-COVID turnover levels were. As we've mentioned in prior calls, our focus is on training these new team members and getting them more efficient and getting them more productive. And as we continue to get our turnover levels down, that will continue to be a focus for us. also training our existing team members to make them better and give them more opportunities to learn and grow. So we will continue to train. But your point on a slightly lower tenure that is true. And we think as our tenure gets back to more historical levels, which is going to take a little while. But as it does get back to historical levels, then we will improve our productivity slightly from there, too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carril of RBC Capital Markets.\nChris Carril: So clearly, a lot of focus on Olive Garden this morning, but I was hoping you could provide some more thoughts on LongHorn and just the continued momentum you're seeing there. Maybe just any thoughts on how the brand is performing relative to the category? And then just anything else you're seeing that's driving the continued strong sales there.\nRicardo Cardenas: Yes, Chris. Todd and his team, as we've said in the past, have been on a journey investing in quality and portion and that continues to pay off. They had over 7% same-restaurant sales this quarter. coming off a very strong result last year, right? So it was a pretty strong performance for Longhorn. Raj mentioned average weekly sales are longer and 25% above the pre-COVID levels. Now the state categories benefit over time, but Longhorn is holding their own in that stay category. They're doing really well. I would say traffic, unlike most of casual dining traffic in the long run down room is up versus pre-Covid. And it's, I think, one of the only full-service restaurant companies out there that have positive traffic in the dining room of anybody of scale. So we're really proud of what they've done. Remember, they were on the journey of simplification before COVID. So they're ahead of everybody else in our portfolio on where they were. And so they didn't have to worry about kind of flushing out that promotion guest that already happened. So really proud of what they're doing. I will also say the state category in general is doing well because they've got a great value. The state category in general has a great value. If you think about what we put on the plate for the dollars you spend, the consumers know that. And so we're going to continue to provide a great value at Longhorn and at all of our brands, but particularly a long run with the quality focus they've had, the simplicity that they've always had and the culture that Todd's building.\nChris Carril: Great. And then maybe just following up on the earlier comments around the consumer. Can you provide any more detail in terms of like what you're seeing regarding mix contribution to the comp any kind of trade up or trade down, any shifts in behavior there, if any?\nRicardo Cardenas: Yes, Chris. If you think about the mix, we're not going to comment as much about the mix impact to comp we did have a strong performance for everything possible that helped our comp. But we're not seeing -- as Raj said earlier, we're not seeing a big check management. We're not seeing a lot of shifting in mix because we've got a very strategic way methodical way we price so that we don't get mix changes when we take price because we've learned this system over time, and it's a proprietary way we do it, -- we use it with our data scientists here. So we haven't seen a whole lot of mix shift. And as I said in the beginning, we've seen -- and the economy has seen a shift from good to services. So that could be why you haven't seen a whole lot of shift in mix in our business and maybe in other -- maybe in our competitors' businesses.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Two questions. The first one just on the competitive outlook. I'm just wondering whether you've seen any change in competitive behavior. Again, you're obviously servicing all ends of the spectrum here. So just wondering what you're seeing from the competition. I know some are concerned of a potential uptick in discounting to drive traffic if commodity inflation were to continue to ease, I know that's contrary to your strategy, to make sure not to deep discount, but just wondering what you're seeing across the competitive landscape? And then I had one follow-up.\nRicardo Cardenas: Jeff, we haven't really seen a lot of deep discounting in the competitive landscape. There aren't many that are even on television. We've got one of the brands that had come off of TV over the years that have indicated they might come back on, but they're not talking about the discounting when they knew that. I think as Raj mentioned, our margins are about pre-COVID levels. I think we were maybe 1 of 2 companies in the public space that had improvement in margin versus pre-COVID. And most of them are talking about trying to improve their margins. So I'm not going to talk about what I think they'll do, but I'll get you back to what we're going to do. We're going to continue to focus on our filters to evaluate our promotional messaging or any messaging that we do, elevating brand equity, simple to execute, not at a deep discount, sticking to our strategy of core guest growth and reacting accordingly. So whatever the -- whatever our competitors do, we'll watch, but we're going to stick to what we've been doing.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then the follow-up is, broadly speaking, as you look at your fiscal '23 guidance, whether Raj, on the specific numbers or Rick, just in terms of the broader thought process. But what do you think is to prioritize the best to worst line of -- or in terms of all your guidance components, whether it's comps, inflation, earnings, prioritize the best to worst line of sight to any of those. Just wondering what you find more or less difficult to potentially forecast as you think about the next few quarters going into potentially slowing economy.\nRajesh Vennam: Well, I think the biggest -- all the one that's going to have the most uncertain data is the traffic. I mean, what kind of traffic are we going to see? And we -- obviously, we've used a wide range of roughly 3% on the back half to accommodate some consumer shifts, but there's a meaningful change. That's -- obviously, that's something that could have an impact. That's really the big one. Dennis, inflation has been heard deferent, I mean there have been a multitude of factors that have been impacting inflation, right? You start with start off with the supply shortages and other things, labor impact. But now as labor starts to come down or get into a better shape, you've got weather events, obviously, global events. So there's a lot going on. inflation is probably the second one. And to me, those are the 2 things. Outside of that, I think everything else was probably pretty well buttoned up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Just 2 questions. First, on the never-ending possible promotion. Do you feel like the benefit of that never never-ending possible promotion, does that extend beyond the promotional window the 7 weeks? Are you able to hold on to those guests even though they might be purchasing something else on the menu?\nRicardo Cardenas: Yes, Peter, as we think about any promotional activity or any limited time offer activity more specifically. We want to make sure that, that limited time offer still elevates brand equity as we've said before. And so we think there is a little bit of a halo over that. Now is it going to be as strong as when you've got the promotional message coming out there, a limited time offer message, probably not. But as we've said -- I think we said in prepared remarks, our year-to-date, our quarter-to-date comp sales are equivalent to our year-to-date comp sales. So it's not like we've seen a big slowdown since we stopped never-ending possible. Now that's across Darden, not necessarily across Olive Garden. But I think that's the idea of marketing or messaging is that should endure longer than the limited time offer, and we think this one did.\nPeter Saleh: Great. And then just on the competitive environment as it relates to new restaurant formation, there's been a lot of discussion around the surge in construction costs. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing more specifically on new restaurant formation from the competition, maybe more specifically independents? Are you seeing more newer restaurants being built? Or is there a pullback in development given the surge in construction costs? Any insight on that would be helpful.\nRicardo Cardenas: Yes, Peter, there are always new restaurants being built. The question is how many are closing to offset the new restaurants being built. As trade areas move, you're going to see restaurants open. But as we think about the number of units that have closed since pre-COVID, but it's still double digits. We're not seeing that number get smaller or bigger, right? So it's starting to level off a little bit. But some strong competitors still opening restaurants on a net basis. We are opening restaurants on a net basis, but we're not seeing a whole lot of net unit growth in total for the full-service restaurant space. Now as the construction costs start to weigh and as Raj mentioned, maybe you'll see a little bit about that. But I think the margins make it a little bit more challenging.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.\nLauren Silberman: Rick, you mentioned 4 of the brands that are running at all-time high internal guest satisfaction levels. What do you think is driving these record levels? And any sense of how this might compare to guest satisfaction across the industry broadly?\nRicardo Cardenas: Well, Lauren, I would say what's driving it is the things that we've been doing over the last few years. We talk about simplicity and how simplicity makes it easier for our teams to do what they do. And if they don't have a lot of different things they have to learn and execute, it gets easier. As we streamlined the menu over the last few years, as Gene even mentioned it a year ago, streamlined the menu, you have more items being -- fewer items being made more often. That means the team gets better at those items versus having these 1 or 2 items that you sell in a week. So that helps experience. Our team members have left to learn on the selling side because there's fewer items. So they get -- they understand the items more. Now what we've seen in our performance is our performance in our brands are getting stronger. We're not necessarily seeing the competitor situation move. They might have been flattening out or maybe a couple here or there have gone a little bit on the negative side. But our satisfaction, we're really proud of it. We're proud of both the internal measures and the external measures. And then finally, I will say we've made significant investments over the last few years in our food and in our people. and that will eventually show up in guest satisfaction, and it has. So we feel really good about what we're doing. And our brands having -- being #1 in all of the categories for Technomic, having a Darden brand being #1 in gets the first time ever. That's amazing news for us. And we're going to continue to do what we've done to improve satisfaction, to make it easier for our restaurant teams to do what they do and to invest in our people and invest in our food.\nLauren Silberman: Great. And just a follow-up on the holiday season. Gift card sales are generally pretty important for early calendar '23. Anything you can share on what you've seen with gift card sales so far this season?\nRajesh Vennam: I see they're pretty consistent with last year. I don't -- I mean, again, there's also gift card sales, the day before Christmas matters a lot. So there's still a little bit of time to go. And then we haven't discounted. We -- a lot of -- before COVID, we used to have some offers for gift cards. We have stop doing that. So pretty much all of our big brands, we don't discount. We don't provide any additional discount to buy gift cards. So for us to see the strength we are seeing without any discounts, we feel pretty good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America.\nSara Senatore: Just a follow-up on the capacity comments. I appreciate the detail on sort of net growth I guess my sense is though that there's growth coming from chains and shrinkage coming from independents. So maybe capacity, if you will, hasn't come down quite as much as unit count would suggest, given the chains tend to, I think, have bigger boxes and higher volumes. So I guess I'm just wondering if you have any kind of thoughts on that, this idea, there's this notion that maybe it's been more of the chains that have gotten hurt and therefore, there's still a fair amount of capacity out there being added. And then I just have a quick follow-up question on labor, that was, I guess, in line with expectations of the wage inflation, but we've been seeing such a moderation in wages, I guess, I'm trying to understand for some concepts, perhaps. So I'm trying to understand if there's maybe a difference across markets or geographical or segments, full service versus maybe limited service where statutory minimum wage increases have more of an impact. Just any color you can give on that because I would have expected, I guess, a bit more moderation there.\nRicardo Cardenas: Sarah, this is Rick. I'll take the capacity question and I'll give Raj to get the labor question. So on the capacity, you're absolutely right. We've seen more independents, which some -- in some places are a little bit smaller in total seats than the chains. But I don't know if you can get 11% of the restaurants to come out and have capacity in seats grow. We have seen the chains that still are -- still opening restaurants, but not at the level they were before, and it's not helping offset all of the other capacities coming out of the system. And with the inflation on construction costs and the margins that a lot of folks have, it's a little bit harder to open restaurants as Raj said earlier, we've actually walked away from deals even though they were above our cost of capital because we thought we had some better deals. We're not quite sure that everybody can do all of that and still get -- open their restaurants and still get the same kind of returns they were getting before. So long answer to your question, but capacity is impacted by what kind of restaurant is opening or closing. And you're absolutely right. The independence is generally a little smaller. And so capacity seats are probably not down as much as units are down.\nRajesh Vennam: Yes. And on the labor side, as you look at where we started the year, the hourly wage rate in our first quarter was mid-9. So I think we said 9.5%. Second quarter was 8.5%. So you saw like a full point change in the rate of inflation. We expect that to continue to go down maybe 50 basis points a quarter for the next 2 quarters. So we are seeing moderation Obviously, this takes time in terms of once you give somebody an increase, that's there, that impact for the full year. And then as we bring on new people, we are seeing that the -- there's not as much pressure on the starting wage as it used to be. It's still high. It's still way higher than pre cover, but it's not -- it doesn't continue to go -- it's not continuing to go up. And so hopefully, that answers your question.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Andrew Strelzik with BMO.\nAndrew Strelzik: I just had 2 questions going back to kind of the food cost outlook. The first one as you move towards flattish commodity inflation or what have you in the fourth quarter, is there an opportunity to be a little more aggressive locking in where you can to improve that visibility on the cost side? Or are there still challenges doing that or maybe you think prices are going even lower. And so that's at play. So curious how you're thinking about that, number one. And number two, it seems like you're maybe a bit more optimistic on where food inflation is headed than some of the commentary from your peers recently. I know there's the food basket, there's timing differences. But I'm curious if there's anything else maybe that's driving that divergence in particular, I'm wondering if maybe this is the scale benefits playing out. So curious how you think about that as well.\nRicardo Cardenas: Andrew, there's a lot in there. So I'm more to try to just address all the pieces. Let's start with the ability to lock in I think for some products, we have that for some, we don't. Like if you think about beef, for instance, I don't think -- I think a lot of suppliers are innovating more. They want to see what's going to happen with supply and really understand the price. So at this point, very few suppliers are willing to last beyond 90 days. So that's truly a structural issue in terms of really the ability, I guess, on that. But there are other products where we can lock in, and we are locking in. So we are continuing to kind of look at wherever there's opportunity to lock in at a good price, we're doing that. That's why you saw that for chicken, for example, we're 90% coverage for the back half. So we did find a price that we thought was good and we -- and closer to flat to last year as we get into the Q4 of this year. So we lock some of that in. And so we are playing it by the year. Our supply team chain team does a great job kind of really thinking through the best strategy to minimize inflation for us while leveraging the relationships. Obviously, as you mentioned, scale helps. Our contracts are bigger, and that gives us the ability to have a little bit more leverage. And again, this is Big part of this is long-standing relationships our teams have built teams have built with the suppliers that help us get to a better number overall rate that we pay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher O'Cull with Stifel.\nChristopher O'Cull: Question relates to margin. And Raj, EBITDA margin has been up about 110 basis points, I think, relative to 2019 in the first half of the year, and I think your guidance kind of implies that the margin could be up 120 basis points or more in the second half of the year. I'm just wondering if you're expecting G&A to continue driving that improvement? Or are you looking for the restaurant margin to become a bigger contributor to the back half improvement?\nRajesh Vennam: Yes. I would say that G&A actually the way -- because of the way we do incentive accruals, G&A is going to be probably higher in the back half than the first half. The restaurant-level margin should improve relative to pre-COVID in the back half versus where it was in the front half. But overall, if you step back, look at overall, your point is right. We do expect growth in the back half now. I'll point out that the starting point is way higher for the back half because our margins were very high in the back half to begin before cold. So we had more room to grow in the first half, and you saw that. But G&A, definitely, we expect G&A in the back half to be higher as a percent of sales than it was in the front half.\nChristopher O'Cull: And just secondly, the segment margin at Olive Garden, I think, compressed about 320 basis points year-over-year this quarter. Can you help parse out what drove that? And how much of it was intentional in terms of menu or labor investments? And how much of it was just due to inflationary pressure?\nRajesh Vennam: It's really inflation. If you think about the 3 items I mentioned that have the highest inflation -- had highest inflation in the quarter, chicken, dairy, and we -- well, that's all has gotten for you. We got 20-plus percent. They have a little over 20% inflation on the commodities this quarter. So that -- when you take that into consideration and look at the fact that we only had 6.5% pricing at Darden level and Olive Garden, obviously, would be pretty close to Darden price in our price level. That's the biggest piece. And then one other piece I mentioned on the call was lettuce while we did not experience the same level of inflation as the general market, it was a big surprise. It was, call it, $4 million to $5 million impact in the quarter, that's meaningful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein.\nDanilo Gargiulo: I was wondering, in the context of potentially slower market environment, what gives you the confidence to raise the outlook for same-store sales? And in particular, on which brands you are elevating your expectations.\nRajesh Vennam: Well, so actually, let me kind of explain how we got there. If you think about our pricing we had in the earlier guidance was 5%, now we're at 6%. We raised the coupon of our sales by 0.5 point. So essentially, we're saying on the top end, we're actually brought down traffic by about 0.5 point. And then on the bottom end, we basically raised it by the full point, which kind of gets to that pricing. So that's really the driver of our change in guidance. then the costs out of the cost -- we have some visibility into costs and we have some ranges around the ones where we have some risk, and that's how we came up with this guidance.\nDanilo Gargiulo: And can you also provide some context on perhaps the frequency of visits of your consumers by brand and whether you're seeing the frequency differently today versus historical averages, maybe by by some type of consumer cohorts or brands?\nRajesh Vennam: No. I think look, our casual dining average frequencies and we call it in that 3 to 4x. And what we see with the core -- all of our brands are seeing over time, the investments we've made pay off and transmitting into a slight tick up in frequency. But again, this is a slow build. We always believe that we -- that's our bet is that this takes time. But we are seeing -- it is -- we're seeing signs of positive momentum. And I think is the fact that we outpaced the industry by over 500 basis points on traffic, tells you that things we've done over time are translating into some increased frequency.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Vaccaro of Raymond James.\nBrian Vaccaro: My question is on Olive Garden. I think you said it was outperforming the industry comp even before the launch of the ring Pasta, which I think is a change versus the last several quarters. And -- just curious, what do you attribute that to? Have you seen the lower end consumer trade down in recent months? Anything in your data there? Or maybe it's execution and guest scores that are starting to kick in and really gain traction on traffic maybe some other dynamic you might offer up.\nRicardo Cardenas: Yes, Brian. Oliver outperformed in Q1 as well. Just the outperformance got a little bit better. When you think about where we were last year, I would say that Olive Garden was probably more fully staffed than maybe some of the other brands in the first quarter of last year. And so other brands may have had a little bit of benefit from more team members. We continue to believe that the investments we made in Olive Garden will continue to pay off over time. And their staffing levels are back to where they were pre-COVID. There are improvements that they've made since pre-COVID in their food. And then finally, Olive Garden, California last year was a big jump for us, and we have a lot of restaurants in California, maybe there wasn't as much across the industry. And so -- that's why we believe that our gap to the industry got better from Q1 to Q2, even though it was positive in Q1.\nBrian Vaccaro: All right. That's helpful. And sorry if I missed it, but on pricing, what was menu pricing in the second quarter? And what's a reasonable expectation moving through Q3, Q4 on menu pricing, just how you're thinking about that?\nRajesh Vennam: Yes, Brian, it was approximately 6.5% in Q2. And for the full year, we're saying it's going to be closer to -- so the way to think about it is Q3 is likely going to be low 6s, and Q4 is likely going to be closer to 5%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Evanko with JPMorgan.\nJohn Evanko : Guys, it's nice to see you coming back to brilliant with the basics. I mean, I think we probably first used that maybe 20 years ago or so. So it's definitely like a trade markable quote for you guys. And especially in the context of increased turnover. And I'm just curious in terms of like where you're seeing that, why you're seeing it first. Are you seeing some of the very high kind of unexplainable like fast quits like some others are? Or are you seeing -- is it a 6-month term over 12-month turnover 24? Is it happening in front of house, back of house? And is there anything that you can do to, I guess -- and the answer might be no, but can you make it a better job for them? And when they are leaving Darden, are they going to other restaurants? Or are they just going to other types of employment?\nRicardo Cardenas: John, The --\nJohn Evanko : Yes. I mean what is the -- I'm trying to determine what is you guys, what is the industry versus just what is the change in employee.\nRicardo Cardenas: Yes. No problem. Yes, brilliant with the basics. It's been here since the jelly days. I remember when that was coined a long time ago. So we've been talking about reeling with the basics for quite a long time. And we believe that we got a little bit more basic, which is the right thing, right? So simplifying our menu, we went to the basic things and we did that better. That said, if you think about our turnover today versus what it was pre coved a lot of the turnover, at least over the last 6 months was 90-day turnover, right? So you come in to start work and then you leave within 90 days. A big chunk of our turnover was during that time period. So we -- all of our general manager conferences happen in August. And the focus and theme August and September, I guess, the theme of those conferences were making Brand X Y Z an even better place to work. how do we continue to make the team member experience better by giving them the tools that they need to do their job, treating them with respect and listening to their concerns. Our turnover is improving. Now I think about where the turnover happens. It generally happens in more of the entry kind of jobs. Our higher turnover is generally in the host area dish area. And generally, in the kitchen, we have more turnover than in the front of the house. That said, we've just completed our engagement survey with Gallup, and we feel really good about the engagement in our team. and we're going to continue to make our brands better places to work by continuing to invest in our team and continuing to teach them and give them opportunities to grow. So where they're going? Don't know, right? So we don't necessarily do exit interviews for every hourly team member on where they're going. But I would guess many of them are leaving the industry. We do have a lot of people that come to work for us that a board for others. So I can't say that we don't have people leave us to go work somewhere else.\nJohn Evanko : And gosh, over an hour ago, you guys -- one of the first comments you made on the call was manager staffing, I think, at historic highs. I mean is that the GM and all assistant manager positions or -- just give a little bit more color in terms of the stability in that essential role.\nRicardo Cardenas: Yes, John, that is all manager positions in our restaurants. So General Manager, Well, general manager, it's a little bit harder to be all-time high, if you have one general manager for every restaurant -- that makes sense. But we're pretty close to that. So if you think about our restaurant manager staffing, it's at all-time high. We have more managers per restaurant today than we did before COVID. And part of it is because we are giving them opportunities to grow and we are proud of the fact that we do a lot of promotions from within. So when somebody knows the brand they're working for and they become a manager there, there's a little bit more loyalty to that brand. So -- and then the other thing, when you think about all the things we did during COVID, we made sure that our managers were we didn't really eliminate our manager teams during Cove. We kept them on because we knew how important they award to bring our team members back. And that's why we feel like we're well staffed and we're fully staffed to manage level.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nick Setyan of Wedbush\nNick Setyan: Just a follow-up to an earlier question. I think you said you expect total restaurant labor inflation to go down by 50 bps sequentially through the end of the year from the 7% that we saw in Q2, that would imply for the year something around 7%, maybe slightly lower than 7%, but your total inflation guidance is 7% with 8.5% commodity inflation at the midpoint. So just maybe reconcile how we get from the combination of where total labor inflation and commodity inflation guidance is versus the total inflation guidance.\nRajesh Vennam: Yes. I think the point here is you have to look at other line items. So utility is probably in that mid-teens -- low to mid-teens. That's part of it. And then we are seeing all other costs being in the low to mid-single digits. So when you take that into consideration, the total inflation of is what we're expecting. So yes, you're right, total restaurant labor inflation is approximately 7%. And you combine that with 8.5%, the big point of that 8% to 9% on prudent beverage. And then utilities in that mid-teens and all other costs low to mid-single digits, that's how you get to 7% on the total. So we're talking about the total cost base. That includes everything.\nNick Setyan: Got it. And then as we kind of think about the inflation gap versus food at home, the gap has been pretty favorable for restaurants for a few quarters now, and that's potentially narrowing and maybe even may reverse next year in terms of calendar '23. How are you thinking about the promotional cadence and the overall competitive environment as that grocery gap maybe even reverses.\nRicardo Cardenas: Yes, Nick, if you think about what people get when they go to a full-service restaurant, they get more than just the food. They get the experience. And that was -- that's what people are coming to us for. a great value already, but there's more than just the commodity that we put on the plate. It's all of the service, all of the other things that people get to do and being able to sit and spend time with their family and friends. And so yes, if there's a little bit of a shift in away from home versus at home, we still think we've got a great value proposition. That said, we're not going to get into what happens in promotional cadence happens, right? So if our competitors start doing significant discounting promotions, Can't say what I think they'll do. I just think their margins are -- makes it a little harder to do that. We're going to react the way that we've been talking about. We're going to continue to focus on driving our core guests driving profitable sales growth, and that's our focus for now in the near future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities.\nJake Bartlett : My first one is on the commentary of expecting less traffic than before. So taking the traffic assumption down by 50 basis points. And I just really want to understand what is driving that? It seems like the -- in the second quarter, it seemed pretty solid or not diversion from expectations. So are you -- the question really is your outlook for the next 2 quarters a little bit less than you were thinking before? We've seen when [Navtec] put out for November, the slight deceleration year-over-year but also a deceleration versus '19. So if you could maybe comment on that -- on the industry and what -- how concerned investors should be about a deceleration just on the industry-wide in November?\nRajesh Vennam: Jake, I think you're activating too much signs to this method here because when we look at how we do this, the midpoint of our guidance is about 75 basis points higher than last time with 1% pricing. So really, what we changed the midpoint by 25 basis points on traffic. That's within the margin of matter of many models we build. I mean, I wish we only had a 50 basis point margin effect around our models. It's obviously a lot wider. I hate to admit it, but I don't think -- we're not experts at prognosticating this business on. So we're doing the best we can, and that's our best estimate at this point.\nJake Bartlett : Okay. And maybe just within that, if you could talk about just what you assume in your guidance for a macro environment. We're seeing, obviously, continued wage inflation. But if you build in -- others have talked about a modest recession or what have you. What is your basic framework on a macro perspective that's embedded in your sales outlook?\nRajesh Vennam: Well, I think what we're incorporating is some potential shifts, changes in consumer behavior. That's why you have a range of 3 percentage points on traffic. If you look at the back half -- and if you look at -- translate that into the guidance range we have, that implies a range of 3 points, that is to accommodate potential changes in consumer behavior, but not a step change. And I said earlier, if there is a major step change, that's not really contemplated in our guidance.\nJake Bartlett : Great. And then a quick question on G&A as a follow-up. I believe the guidance kind of -- before you've been talking about $400 million as being a good number for the year. You're running significantly behind that run rate in the first half, you commented that you expect it to go higher. But just roughly, what should we expect for just G&A as a whole for the year in '23 -- fiscal '23?\nRajesh Vennam: Yes, Jake, at this point, our best estimate is $390 million.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, it appears we have no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nKevin Kalicak: Thanks, Todd. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday, March 23, before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call. Have a great holiday and happy new year.\nOperator: This will conclude our call today. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ricardo Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and happy holidays, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter. All of our brands performed at a high level by remaining focused on our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service and atmosphere. At the Darden level, we continue to strengthen and leverage our 4 competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Being brilliant with the basics starts with achieving and maintaining appropriate staffing levels in our restaurants. Across our brands, our teams are doing a great job of ensuring we are ready to run 14 great shifts a week. At each of our brands, we are fully staffed at the team member level, and manager staffing is at historic highs. As a result, our teams are executing more consistently, which in turn is driving strong guest satisfaction across our brands, according to both internal and external sources. During the quarter, 4 of our brands achieved all-time high internal guest satisfaction ratings and the others remain near all-time highs. Also, within Technomic industry tracking tool, a Darden brand was ranked #1 among major casual dining brands in each measurement category. I am particularly proud of Olive Garden's performance. During the quarter, they brought back their most popular limited time offers, never any possible. As you may recall, when I talked last I shared that any promotional activity or brands introduced should be evaluated with the following 3 filters. First, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations which allows our teams to consistently deliver exceptional guest experiences. And third, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests, but doing that in a way that drives profitable sales growth. Three years after it was last offered, the 2022 version of never any possible checked all 3 of these boxes. First, it leveraged Olive Garden's iconic brand equity by perfectly reinforcing their competitive advantage of never-ending abundant craveable Italian food. Next, it was amplified by only offering existing menu items with limited add-on choices, which made it easier to execute, resulting in great guest experiences. Finally, it was priced $3 higher than in 2019, which significantly improved the margin of this offer while still providing tremendous value for our guests. Never ending possible exceeded expectations, and we saw a step change in Olive Garden's positive gap to industry traffic during the 7 weeks at ramp. I'm even more encouraged by this performance, given that it was supported with about 3/4 of the media past years. Going forward, the team will build on their learnings and share insights across our brands but this may be the only limited time offer we do at Olive Garden this fiscal year. Across our brands, we continue to drive strong execution of the off-premise guest experience through ongoing investments in technology that reduce friction for our guests and our operators. For example, many of our guests still prefer to call in their to-go order. However, taking payment over the phone or when the guests arrived is both inefficient for our teams and inconvenient for our guests. To help address this, we rolled out online payment for call-in orders during the quarter, enhancing convenience for our guests and making our to-go specialists more efficient. To-go sales remain sticky across our core casual dining brand, accounting for 25% of total sales at Olive Garden, 14% of Longhorn and 13% at Cheddar's. Digital transactions accounted for 62% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 10% of Darden's total sales. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams, and they have enjoyed welcoming even more guests back into their restaurants this season. In fact, the Capital Grille, ADB and CD52 enjoyed all-time daily sales record on Thanksgiving Day, and bookings for this holiday season are encouraging. The holidays are also a great reminder that being of service is at the heart of our business. and we embraced a higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve, our guests, our team members and our communities. One of the ways we serve our communities is through our harvest program. One in 8 households in our country live without consistent access to food. To help fight hunger, our restaurants donate fresh, unused food to local food banks and nonprofits in their communities on a weekly basis throughout the year. Since the inception of this program, more than 131 million pounds of food have been donated, which is the equivalent of more than 100 million meals. The impact of our harvest program takes on added significance during the holidays. And I am delighted that our teams are helping to make a difference in some in communities across the country. I'm so proud of the focus and commitment our teams continue to display. Their disciplined approach in executing on our strategy is what enables us to succeed regardless of the operating environment. This is evidenced by the fact that just last week, we surpassed $10 billion in sales on a trailing 52-week basis for the first time in Darden's history. On behalf of our senior leadership team and the Board of Directors, I want to thank our 180,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guests and our communities. I wish you all a wonderful holiday season.  Now I'll turn it over to Raj. Eric, thanks for the question. Never any possible, we said in our prepared remarks is maybe the only limited time offer, likely only been a limited time offer. As you talk about the $6 take home, that's on our core menu. So it's not considered limited time, it's on our menu. But for competitive reasons, we're not going to discuss any more promotional plan details. And so we're going to continue to use our filters that we mentioned, first, elevating brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to live; second, simple to execute; and third, not at a deep discount. As you'll probably see on ATV today, we're currently airing our open big pastas, which are core menu items for us. So they're not a limited time offer, and it includes our new Ravioli Carbonara, none of these items are discounted. So we're going to stick to our strategy, as Raj said, core growth, core discount growth, and we're going to react accordingly. Yes, Brian. First, let me say how proud I handle the work Dan and his team have done working on keeping with our strategy at Olive Garden. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, Olive Garden already had a positive gap in same-restaurant sales to the industry before never-ending possible, and that gap increased when we brought never-ending possible back for 7 weeks. So it ran about half of the quarter. We're not going to kind of talk about how much nevering possible and contributed to the quarter, but it was a good jump for us. And so as we think about the rest of the year, our guidance contemplates continued strength in Olive Garden, but probably not at the strength that we had for nevering possible. Remember, this is an iconic limited time offer, uniquely positioned, and it covers all 3 filters that we mentioned. And as I said in our prepared remarks, we have exceeded our expectations. So -- and that's a pretty pleasant surprise for us. If you think about given the higher price point, the lower media support, but it does speak to how iconic that brand offer is and the things that Olive Garden brings in such a compelling way. And then finally, we haven't run in 3 years. So guests were really excited for the return, and it fits really well in our second quarter. So if you think about our lowest volume quarter of the year second quarter, never any possible helps keep our traffic a little bit higher so that we don't have to think about bringing team members hours down and then bringing team members back when the holidays go up. So we really were appreciative and we really love with the work that Olive Garden did and where nevering possible was. But not to say that our 3-year stack is going to stay the same as it did in Q2. Yes, Brian, I won't necessarily talk about 23. I'll just talk about what we're seeing, not being an economist, I listen to what they have to say. But as you all know, everybody on this call knows, consumer spending drives the U.S. economy. The -- we've seen a shift in spending though, from durable household goods or durable goods to leisure services, and the restaurant industry has benefited from that shift. Casual dining same-restaurant sales improved from Q1 to Q2 and our positive gap to the industry improved even more during that time. So one of the benefits of our portfolio, as you mentioned, is we have a wide range of consumers. We serve a lot of them all across all of the spectrum. And our data indicates the higher-end consumer hasn't seen the same impact as consumers at the lower end of the spectrum. But if you think about the prepared remarks, sales at Thanksgiving were a record for Fine Dining and Seasons 52 and bookings for this holiday season are encouraging. So it seems like the higher end consumer is doing pretty well. And I know there's been a lot of talk over the year about consumers that's below $50,000 in income because high inflation impacts that consumer more disproportionately, but we've seen a little softness in that consumer over the last 6 months, but the mix of the 50,000 income and under is still above pre-covid levels for us. Even though that shift has come down a little bit, we're still above pre-covid levels at the 50,000 and below. And I would say, keep in mind that a lot of our consumers below $50,000 are single, are retirees are living in multigenerational households. So maybe $50,000 goes a little bit farther for that consumer. But without commenting on the future, we have seen a pretty good performance across all of those consumers over the last few months other than the fact that the 50,000 below consumer is lower than it was 6 months ago, but still higher than it was pre. Andrew This is Rick again. If we see deterioration in the calendar 2023, we always look at ways to tighten and find ways to improve productivity and improve our administrative expenses. We think we're actually really good at doing that. So if something gets really -- shifts really badly in the wrong way, we're going to find ways to at least find places to tighten. On the marketing spend, Raj talked about what our marketing spend is for the rest of this year and for the whole year. We don't anticipate making a big change in that no matter what happens over the next 6 months. We're going to continue to use the filters that we mentioned. And I will say Olive Garden, as I said before, we'll always have advertising in their mix because of their scale. But we're going to stick to our strategy of core growth. We're going to react accordingly to whatever happens. And as we've said in the past, and Raj said it too, if and when we increase our marketing spend, we'll expect it to return -- to earn a return compared to what it would have been without the spend. So we're going to -- as you've seen us in the past, we react when things happen, and we think we'll do the same thing going forward. David, if you think about what we've done over the last few years, we have significantly reduced marketing spending at Olive Garden. And we've talked in the past at how that could be about a 10-point drop in traffic for us. But we're focusing on driving core users to Olive Garden, core gas versus promotional users. And so what we see as an opportunity, we've got more capacity in our restaurants than we did before. But a lot of that in-restaurant experience has moved to the off-premise experience. As you see Olive Garden still at 25% off-premise where prior to COVID, it was much lower than that. So we see it as an opportunity to continue to focus on our strategy of pricing below our competition, pricing below inflation by finding other cost savings to help offset that and give our consumers a great value so they don't need a promotional message to come in and they just get a great value every time they come. Jared, let me talk high level about chatter and talk a little bit about the opening. Cheddar's has made significant improvements in their business model. versus pre-COVID, even with significant inflation, they had a lot of productivity enhancements with the simplified menu and a streamlined menu so that we felt more comfortable opening restaurants at a quicker pace. Not only that, they have really built their leadership pipeline and have been able to staff all of these restaurants with managing partners that have run Cheddar's, and we have a pipeline of more ready to go as we open restaurants. So yes, this was our highest quarter of openings for Cheddar's. We opened 7 restaurants. But again, high level, really proud of the work that JW and his team have done at Cheddar's, really proud of the progress they've made in staffing their restaurants, building their pipeline, and we're seeing some pretty strong performance in these new restaurants. David, as we think about our prototype designs for the future, we always look for ways to trim costs out of our prototypes and find new ways to build the new materials to use. We have built some slightly smaller prototypes or at all of our brands, not necessarily because of the to-go versus the dining room but because it makes it to go experience a little easier by shifting where that to-go area is. Remember, the dining room is the least expensive part of the building. right? So if you really want to take a lot of the cost out of the building, you got to take the cost out of the kitchen. And we think we've got a great kitchen, but we'll find ways to rightsize the prototypes for the market that they're in. without overcomplicating so that we have 50 different prototypes. But we, as I said, our development team is focusing on finding the most efficient building in the markets that we compete in. We've also taken some existing sites as restaurants have closed or their leases have expired for other brands. we've actually gone in and infilled those restaurants, which are slightly less expensive because you don't have some of the framing costs and some of the plumbing. So it helps us in that respect. Dennis, we have a lower tenure today than we did before COVID because of the turnover over the time through COVID. Our turnover is still elevated from the pre-Covid levels, but it's getting better and it's getting -- we're working on getting it closer to what our pre-COVID turnover levels were. As we've mentioned in prior calls, our focus is on training these new team members and getting them more efficient and getting them more productive. And as we continue to get our turnover levels down, that will continue to be a focus for us. also training our existing team members to make them better and give them more opportunities to learn and grow. So we will continue to train. But your point on a slightly lower tenure that is true. And we think as our tenure gets back to more historical levels, which is going to take a little while. But as it does get back to historical levels, then we will improve our productivity slightly from there, too. Yes, Chris. Todd and his team, as we've said in the past, have been on a journey investing in quality and portion and that continues to pay off. They had over 7% same-restaurant sales this quarter. coming off a very strong result last year, right? So it was a pretty strong performance for Longhorn. Raj mentioned average weekly sales are longer and 25% above the pre-COVID levels. Now the state categories benefit over time, but Longhorn is holding their own in that stay category. They're doing really well. I would say traffic, unlike most of casual dining traffic in the long run down room is up versus pre-Covid. And it's, I think, one of the only full-service restaurant companies out there that have positive traffic in the dining room of anybody of scale. So we're really proud of what they've done. Remember, they were on the journey of simplification before COVID. So they're ahead of everybody else in our portfolio on where they were. And so they didn't have to worry about kind of flushing out that promotion guest that already happened. So really proud of what they're doing. I will also say the state category in general is doing well because they've got a great value. The state category in general has a great value. If you think about what we put on the plate for the dollars you spend, the consumers know that. And so we're going to continue to provide a great value at Longhorn and at all of our brands, but particularly a long run with the quality focus they've had, the simplicity that they've always had and the culture that Todd's building. Yes, Chris. If you think about the mix, we're not going to comment as much about the mix impact to comp we did have a strong performance for everything possible that helped our comp. But we're not seeing -- as Raj said earlier, we're not seeing a big check management. We're not seeing a lot of shifting in mix because we've got a very strategic way methodical way we price so that we don't get mix changes when we take price because we've learned this system over time, and it's a proprietary way we do it, -- we use it with our data scientists here. So we haven't seen a whole lot of mix shift. And as I said in the beginning, we've seen -- and the economy has seen a shift from good to services. So that could be why you haven't seen a whole lot of shift in mix in our business and maybe in other -- maybe in our competitors' businesses. Jeff, we haven't really seen a lot of deep discounting in the competitive landscape. There aren't many that are even on television. We've got one of the brands that had come off of TV over the years that have indicated they might come back on, but they're not talking about the discounting when they knew that. I think as Raj mentioned, our margins are about pre-COVID levels. I think we were maybe 1 of 2 companies in the public space that had improvement in margin versus pre-COVID. And most of them are talking about trying to improve their margins. So I'm not going to talk about what I think they'll do, but I'll get you back to what we're going to do. We're going to continue to focus on our filters to evaluate our promotional messaging or any messaging that we do, elevating brand equity, simple to execute, not at a deep discount, sticking to our strategy of core guest growth and reacting accordingly. So whatever the -- whatever our competitors do, we'll watch, but we're going to stick to what we've been doing. Yes, Peter, as we think about any promotional activity or any limited time offer activity more specifically. We want to make sure that, that limited time offer still elevates brand equity as we've said before. And so we think there is a little bit of a halo over that. Now is it going to be as strong as when you've got the promotional message coming out there, a limited time offer message, probably not. But as we've said -- I think we said in prepared remarks, our year-to-date, our quarter-to-date comp sales are equivalent to our year-to-date comp sales. So it's not like we've seen a big slowdown since we stopped never-ending possible. Now that's across Darden, not necessarily across Olive Garden. But I think that's the idea of marketing or messaging is that should endure longer than the limited time offer, and we think this one did. Yes, Peter, there are always new restaurants being built. The question is how many are closing to offset the new restaurants being built. As trade areas move, you're going to see restaurants open. But as we think about the number of units that have closed since pre-COVID, but it's still double digits. We're not seeing that number get smaller or bigger, right? So it's starting to level off a little bit. But some strong competitors still opening restaurants on a net basis. We are opening restaurants on a net basis, but we're not seeing a whole lot of net unit growth in total for the full-service restaurant space. Now as the construction costs start to weigh and as Raj mentioned, maybe you'll see a little bit about that. But I think the margins make it a little bit more challenging. Well, Lauren, I would say what's driving it is the things that we've been doing over the last few years. We talk about simplicity and how simplicity makes it easier for our teams to do what they do. And if they don't have a lot of different things they have to learn and execute, it gets easier. As we streamlined the menu over the last few years, as Gene even mentioned it a year ago, streamlined the menu, you have more items being -- fewer items being made more often. That means the team gets better at those items versus having these 1 or 2 items that you sell in a week. So that helps experience. Our team members have left to learn on the selling side because there's fewer items. So they get -- they understand the items more. Now what we've seen in our performance is our performance in our brands are getting stronger. We're not necessarily seeing the competitor situation move. They might have been flattening out or maybe a couple here or there have gone a little bit on the negative side. But our satisfaction, we're really proud of it. We're proud of both the internal measures and the external measures. And then finally, I will say we've made significant investments over the last few years in our food and in our people. and that will eventually show up in guest satisfaction, and it has. So we feel really good about what we're doing. And our brands having -- being #1 in all of the categories for Technomic, having a Darden brand being #1 in gets the first time ever. That's amazing news for us. And we're going to continue to do what we've done to improve satisfaction, to make it easier for our restaurant teams to do what they do and to invest in our people and invest in our food. Sarah, this is Rick. I'll take the capacity question and I'll give Raj to get the labor question. So on the capacity, you're absolutely right. We've seen more independents, which some -- in some places are a little bit smaller in total seats than the chains. But I don't know if you can get 11% of the restaurants to come out and have capacity in seats grow. We have seen the chains that still are -- still opening restaurants, but not at the level they were before, and it's not helping offset all of the other capacities coming out of the system. And with the inflation on construction costs and the margins that a lot of folks have, it's a little bit harder to open restaurants as Raj said earlier, we've actually walked away from deals even though they were above our cost of capital because we thought we had some better deals. We're not quite sure that everybody can do all of that and still get -- open their restaurants and still get the same kind of returns they were getting before. So long answer to your question, but capacity is impacted by what kind of restaurant is opening or closing. And you're absolutely right. The independence is generally a little smaller. And so capacity seats are probably not down as much as units are down. Andrew, there's a lot in there. So I'm more to try to just address all the pieces. Let's start with the ability to lock in I think for some products, we have that for some, we don't. Like if you think about beef, for instance, I don't think -- I think a lot of suppliers are innovating more. They want to see what's going to happen with supply and really understand the price. So at this point, very few suppliers are willing to last beyond 90 days. So that's truly a structural issue in terms of really the ability, I guess, on that. But there are other products where we can lock in, and we are locking in. So we are continuing to kind of look at wherever there's opportunity to lock in at a good price, we're doing that. That's why you saw that for chicken, for example, we're 90% coverage for the back half. So we did find a price that we thought was good and we -- and closer to flat to last year as we get into the Q4 of this year. So we lock some of that in. And so we are playing it by the year. Our supply team chain team does a great job kind of really thinking through the best strategy to minimize inflation for us while leveraging the relationships. Obviously, as you mentioned, scale helps. Our contracts are bigger, and that gives us the ability to have a little bit more leverage. And again, this is Big part of this is long-standing relationships our teams have built teams have built with the suppliers that help us get to a better number overall rate that we pay. Yes, Brian. Oliver outperformed in Q1 as well. Just the outperformance got a little bit better. When you think about where we were last year, I would say that Olive Garden was probably more fully staffed than maybe some of the other brands in the first quarter of last year. And so other brands may have had a little bit of benefit from more team members. We continue to believe that the investments we made in Olive Garden will continue to pay off over time. And their staffing levels are back to where they were pre-COVID. There are improvements that they've made since pre-COVID in their food. And then finally, Olive Garden, California last year was a big jump for us, and we have a lot of restaurants in California, maybe there wasn't as much across the industry. And so -- that's why we believe that our gap to the industry got better from Q1 to Q2, even though it was positive in Q1. John, The -- Yes. No problem. Yes, brilliant with the basics. It's been here since the jelly days. I remember when that was coined a long time ago. So we've been talking about reeling with the basics for quite a long time. And we believe that we got a little bit more basic, which is the right thing, right? So simplifying our menu, we went to the basic things and we did that better. That said, if you think about our turnover today versus what it was pre coved a lot of the turnover, at least over the last 6 months was 90-day turnover, right? So you come in to start work and then you leave within 90 days. A big chunk of our turnover was during that time period. So we -- all of our general manager conferences happen in August. And the focus and theme August and September, I guess, the theme of those conferences were making Brand X Y Z an even better place to work. how do we continue to make the team member experience better by giving them the tools that they need to do their job, treating them with respect and listening to their concerns. Our turnover is improving. Now I think about where the turnover happens. It generally happens in more of the entry kind of jobs. Our higher turnover is generally in the host area dish area. And generally, in the kitchen, we have more turnover than in the front of the house. That said, we've just completed our engagement survey with Gallup, and we feel really good about the engagement in our team. and we're going to continue to make our brands better places to work by continuing to invest in our team and continuing to teach them and give them opportunities to grow. So where they're going? Don't know, right? So we don't necessarily do exit interviews for every hourly team member on where they're going. But I would guess many of them are leaving the industry. We do have a lot of people that come to work for us that a board for others. So I can't say that we don't have people leave us to go work somewhere else. Yes, John, that is all manager positions in our restaurants. So General Manager, Well, general manager, it's a little bit harder to be all-time high, if you have one general manager for every restaurant -- that makes sense. But we're pretty close to that. So if you think about our restaurant manager staffing, it's at all-time high. We have more managers per restaurant today than we did before COVID. And part of it is because we are giving them opportunities to grow and we are proud of the fact that we do a lot of promotions from within. So when somebody knows the brand they're working for and they become a manager there, there's a little bit more loyalty to that brand. So -- and then the other thing, when you think about all the things we did during COVID, we made sure that our managers were we didn't really eliminate our manager teams during Cove. We kept them on because we knew how important they award to bring our team members back. And that's why we feel like we're well staffed and we're fully staffed to manage level. Yes, Nick, if you think about what people get when they go to a full-service restaurant, they get more than just the food. They get the experience. And that was -- that's what people are coming to us for. a great value already, but there's more than just the commodity that we put on the plate. It's all of the service, all of the other things that people get to do and being able to sit and spend time with their family and friends. And so yes, if there's a little bit of a shift in away from home versus at home, we still think we've got a great value proposition. That said, we're not going to get into what happens in promotional cadence happens, right? So if our competitors start doing significant discounting promotions, Can't say what I think they'll do. I just think their margins are -- makes it a little harder to do that. We're going to react the way that we've been talking about. We're going to continue to focus on driving our core guests driving profitable sales growth, and that's our focus for now in the near future."

            "name": "Rajesh Vennam",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.5 billion, 9.4% higher than last year, driven by 7.3% same-restaurant sales growth along with the addition of 35 net new restaurants. This same restaurant sales performance outperformed -- outpaced the industry by 370 basis points and our same restaurant gas counts are performed even more as they exceeded the industry benchmark by 550 basis points. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.52, an increase of 2.7% above last year. Total EBITDA was $330 million, and we returned $249 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter, consisting of $149 million in dividends and $100 million in share repurchases. Total pricing for the quarter was approximately 6.5%, 200 basis points below total inflation of roughly 8.5%. Now looking at the details of the P&L compared to last year, Food and beverage expenses were 240 basis points higher, driven by commodities inflation of approximately 13%, which significantly outpaced our pricing. As we expected, chicken dairy and grains continue to be categories experiencing the highest levels of inflation. Produce especially let us was much higher than expected due to poor growing conditions and weather-related events in the quarter.  However, our scale and vendor partnerships help minimize this impact relative to the general market. National labor was 30 basis points better than last year, even with total restaurant labor inflation of 7%. Our restaurants continue to run efficient labor despite hourly wage inflation of 8.5%. National expenses were 20 basis points favorable as we leveraged higher sales that more than offset elevated inflation on utilities as well as higher repairs and maintenance expense. Marketing expenses were 30 basis points higher than last year as we increased media support for the reintroduction of never-ending possible. This was in line with our expectations heading into the quarter. G&A expenses were 40 basis points below last year, driven by sales leverage and a lower incentive accrual, which was in line with our plan. This favorability was partially offset by higher mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. And as a reminder, due to the way we hedge this expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line. Page 13 of our presentation illustrates the roughly 20 basis point reduction to operating income from mark-to-market expense and the 150 basis point benefit to the tax rate. The effective tax rate of 12.1% this quarter would have been 13.6% without the impact from the hedge. Now looking at our margin performance versus pre-Covid, we grew operating income margin by 160 basis points, while underpricing inflation by more than 500 basis points. Increased food and beverage costs were more than offset by improved productivity, reduced marketing, and other cost savings initiatives. Looking at our segment performance. All of our segments significantly outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. Sales at Olive Garden were 9.2% above last year driven by same-restaurant sales of 7.6%. Average weekly sales at Olive Garden were 104% of the recovery level. LongHorn sales were 9.7% above last year with same-restaurant sales growth of 7.3%. Average weekly sales at LongHorn were 125% of the pre=COVID level. Sales in our Fine Dining segment were 7% above last year, driven by Same Russian sales of 5.9% and average sales -- weekly sales were 117% of the pre-covid level. Our other segment sales were 10.5% above last year -- with same-restaurant sales of 7.1% and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-covid level. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We have updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the back half of the year. We now expect Total sales was $10.3 billion to $10.45 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 5% to 6.5%, 55 to 60 new restaurants; capital spending of $525 million to $575 million, total inflation of approximately 7%, and we plan to continue underpricing total inflation with annual pricing of approximately 6%. Furthermore, we expect commodities inflation between 8% and 9%. An annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 123 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. All resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.60 and $8. Looking at the third and fourth quarters, we expect the EPS growth rate year-over-year to be fairly balanced. In the third quarter, we estimate the outsized sales growth from lapping Omicron last year to be partially offset by underpricing inflation by approximately 50 basis points. In the fourth quarter, we expect inflation to further moderate on our pricing gap drivers contributing to margin growth. Now to wrap up, let me say that we're very pleased with how our teams are managing their businesses and delivering strong results. We remain disciplined in adhering to our strategy and providing value to our guests in the face of strong inflation. We're confident in the underlying strength of our business model and our team's ability to continue managing through this unpredictable environment effectively.  Now we will open it up for questions. Yes, Eric, we're going to be close. So I think that as we said, it should be close to 1 -- we said 10 to 20 basis points above last year. That's how we think about it. It's truly inflation on the construction costs and some equipment costs as well. So it's really -- a lot of it is new restaurant related. Some is on the -- even on the facilities CapEx, there's a little bit higher inflation. Yes, David, it's really the fact that last 2 quarters were 15% was in the first quarter, second quarter was 13%. So as you look at the back half, really, Q3, we're thinking it's going to be mid- to high single digits and then Q4 is closer to flat. So if you do that, what that translates into on the year is closer to that 8% to 9% that's really the difference. I think when we spoke the last time, we expected a step change from the first half to the second half. And we are seeing that. However, it's not as big as we thought. It's still a pretty big change. I mean, as I just mentioned, we're going from mid-teens to high single -- mid- to high single digits as we get into Q3 and close it to flat for Q4. So pretty big change, but there were a few there are a few items that are higher than we would have expected, namely dairy, grains and produce, and quite a bit of this is weather-related and so that's actually baked into our expectations going forward. Yes, versus last year. We had 7 restaurants versus last year at Cheddar's 4 in the quarter. And we -- those restaurants are performing really well. So they're primarily in markets close to where Cheddar's already exists. It's not like we're -- we have a lot of restaurants opening in brand-new markets. But we are looking at newer markets to open Cheddar's in. But as we mentioned early on in the acquisition of Cheddar's, we thought we had more room to infill markets that they already have restaurants. So that helps us leverage our scale in those markets that helps us leverage our supply chain and our people. I think there's always risk. As you think about, that's why we have a range of 8% to 9% as our assumption going in. We'll have to see how this plays out, right? I mean some of the stuff, like I have mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, Q2, the impact on product produce especially led us -- no one expected that. It came out of nowhere. It was weather related. There were 2 hurricanes and Florida, 2 hurricanes in Mexico, they just really destroyed the crops. And that cycle stuff is always a risk. We contemplated some of that in our guidance. Yes, David, let me start by saying pretty much on average. Our new restaurants exceed cost of capital by quite a bit. We had a big margin to begin with. Now the construction costs have gone up, so have our unit economics. So if you look at overall performance of where we are, I just mentioned earlier, our operating income this quarter was 160 basis points higher than pre COVID. So our 4-wall unit level economics have gotten better that helps mitigate some of the construction cost increases. Now with that said, we already -- we obviously want to continue to maintain the pace of opening. But we continue to monitor inflation in construction costs. And we are being very disciplined. There are a few times where we have walked away from some deals because the cost was too high even though that would have probably exceeded our cost of capital. We're just being a little bit more selective on that front. Now all that said, we're starting to see some green shoots on the construction side. The last few bids, I think, were more closer to or below -- slightly below elevated budget. But at least it's a positive sign. So we think there are -- there's some -- potentially this could lead to some decrease in the level of inflation over time. Dennis, I think the reaction is not that dissimilar to historical meaning we are getting a pretty decent flow-through from pricing north of 90%. And so really not seeing any major pushback. We haven't seen any moderation on the check mix. There have been things here and there where maybe advertiser pricing, we may not have gotten the exact level of flow-through. But overall, when you look big picture, it doesn't look like there's a lot of resistance. Now we are pricing a lot less than our competitors. So I don't know what is happening with the industry itself, but our pricing is well below the industry. And maybe that's part of what -- why we're not seeing a lot of existence. Well, I think the biggest -- all the one that's going to have the most uncertain data is the traffic. I mean, what kind of traffic are we going to see? And we -- obviously, we've used a wide range of roughly 3% on the back half to accommodate some consumer shifts, but there's a meaningful change. That's -- obviously, that's something that could have an impact. That's really the big one. Dennis, inflation has been heard deferent, I mean there have been a multitude of factors that have been impacting inflation, right? You start with start off with the supply shortages and other things, labor impact. But now as labor starts to come down or get into a better shape, you've got weather events, obviously, global events. So there's a lot going on. inflation is probably the second one. And to me, those are the 2 things. Outside of that, I think everything else was probably pretty well buttoned up. I see they're pretty consistent with last year. I don't -- I mean, again, there's also gift card sales, the day before Christmas matters a lot. So there's still a little bit of time to go. And then we haven't discounted. We -- a lot of -- before COVID, we used to have some offers for gift cards. We have stop doing that. So pretty much all of our big brands, we don't discount. We don't provide any additional discount to buy gift cards. So for us to see the strength we are seeing without any discounts, we feel pretty good. Yes. And on the labor side, as you look at where we started the year, the hourly wage rate in our first quarter was mid-9. So I think we said 9.5%. Second quarter was 8.5%. So you saw like a full point change in the rate of inflation. We expect that to continue to go down maybe 50 basis points a quarter for the next 2 quarters. So we are seeing moderation Obviously, this takes time in terms of once you give somebody an increase, that's there, that impact for the full year. And then as we bring on new people, we are seeing that the -- there's not as much pressure on the starting wage as it used to be. It's still high. It's still way higher than pre cover, but it's not -- it doesn't continue to go -- it's not continuing to go up. And so hopefully, that answers your question. Yes. I would say that G&A actually the way -- because of the way we do incentive accruals, G&A is going to be probably higher in the back half than the first half. The restaurant-level margin should improve relative to pre-COVID in the back half versus where it was in the front half. But overall, if you step back, look at overall, your point is right. We do expect growth in the back half now. I'll point out that the starting point is way higher for the back half because our margins were very high in the back half to begin before cold. So we had more room to grow in the first half, and you saw that. But G&A, definitely, we expect G&A in the back half to be higher as a percent of sales than it was in the front half. It's really inflation. If you think about the 3 items I mentioned that have the highest inflation -- had highest inflation in the quarter, chicken, dairy, and we -- well, that's all has gotten for you. We got 20-plus percent. They have a little over 20% inflation on the commodities this quarter. So that -- when you take that into consideration and look at the fact that we only had 6.5% pricing at Darden level and Olive Garden, obviously, would be pretty close to Darden price in our price level. That's the biggest piece. And then one other piece I mentioned on the call was lettuce while we did not experience the same level of inflation as the general market, it was a big surprise. It was, call it, $4 million to $5 million impact in the quarter, that's meaningful. Well, so actually, let me kind of explain how we got there. If you think about our pricing we had in the earlier guidance was 5%, now we're at 6%. We raised the coupon of our sales by 0.5 point. So essentially, we're saying on the top end, we're actually brought down traffic by about 0.5 point. And then on the bottom end, we basically raised it by the full point, which kind of gets to that pricing. So that's really the driver of our change in guidance. then the costs out of the cost -- we have some visibility into costs and we have some ranges around the ones where we have some risk, and that's how we came up with this guidance. No. I think look, our casual dining average frequencies and we call it in that 3 to 4x. And what we see with the core -- all of our brands are seeing over time, the investments we've made pay off and transmitting into a slight tick up in frequency. But again, this is a slow build. We always believe that we -- that's our bet is that this takes time. But we are seeing -- it is -- we're seeing signs of positive momentum. And I think is the fact that we outpaced the industry by over 500 basis points on traffic, tells you that things we've done over time are translating into some increased frequency. Yes, Brian, it was approximately 6.5% in Q2. And for the full year, we're saying it's going to be closer to -- so the way to think about it is Q3 is likely going to be low 6s, and Q4 is likely going to be closer to 5%. Yes. I think the point here is you have to look at other line items. So utility is probably in that mid-teens -- low to mid-teens. That's part of it. And then we are seeing all other costs being in the low to mid-single digits. So when you take that into consideration, the total inflation of is what we're expecting. So yes, you're right, total restaurant labor inflation is approximately 7%. And you combine that with 8.5%, the big point of that 8% to 9% on prudent beverage. And then utilities in that mid-teens and all other costs low to mid-single digits, that's how you get to 7% on the total. So we're talking about the total cost base. That includes everything. Jake, I think you're activating too much signs to this method here because when we look at how we do this, the midpoint of our guidance is about 75 basis points higher than last time with 1% pricing. So really, what we changed the midpoint by 25 basis points on traffic. That's within the margin of matter of many models we build. I mean, I wish we only had a 50 basis point margin effect around our models. It's obviously a lot wider. I hate to admit it, but I don't think -- we're not experts at prognosticating this business on. So we're doing the best we can, and that's our best estimate at this point. Well, I think what we're incorporating is some potential shifts, changes in consumer behavior. That's why you have a range of 3 percentage points on traffic. If you look at the back half -- and if you look at -- translate that into the guidance range we have, that implies a range of 3 points, that is to accommodate potential changes in consumer behavior, but not a step change. And I said earlier, if there is a major step change, that's not really contemplated in our guidance. Yes, Jake, at this point, our best estimate is $390 million."

Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Jake. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings on Friday, December 16, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. During today's call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing first quarter performance as a comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter and our focus moving forward and Raj will provide details on our financial results. Now, I will turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our press release, we had a solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging inflationary and uncertain macroeconomic environment. This was also the first quarter where we began to see the industry return to normal seasonal patterns. I'm proud of the way our restaurant teams are performing. Our brands remain focused on executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere, while at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on strengthening and leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Our people bring our brands to life every day, and our restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level, even with a lot of new team members as our staffing has returned to normal levels. Our team's ability to be brilliant with the basics is driving strong guest satisfaction across our brands. These satisfaction measures at Olive Garden are at or near all-time highs, and steaks grilled correctly scores at LongHorn Steakhouse are the highest in their history. We remain focused on creating great learning environments for new team members to ensure they are fully trained and execute to our standards. Further, our ongoing investments in our team members helps reinforce our strong employment proposition. This focus takes on added significance as we open value creating new restaurants, which further strengthens our scale advantage. During the quarter, we successfully staffed and opened nine new restaurants and we remain on track to open 55 to 60 new restaurants this fiscal year. We also continue to invest in our digital platform and To Go sales benefited from these investments during the quarter. To Go sales accounted for 24% of total sales at Olive Garden, 14% at LongHorn Steakhouse and 13% at Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Digital transactions accounted for 32% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 10% of Darden's total sales. Our technology investments have created an infrastructure that reduces friction for our guests and our operators, and we will continue to invest in technology that benefits both off-premise and in-restaurant dining occasions. We are also leveraging our scale to help mitigate the impact of heightened inflation. During the quarter, we continued to experience significant commodities cost pressure, and our supply chain team did an excellent job of working with the suppliers to minimize or offset cost increases to the extent possible. Inflation remains a headwind for consumers as well, particularly those in households making less than $50,000 a year. Olive Garden and Cheddar's have more direct exposure to these guests. Looking at guest behavior across our entire portfolio, we are seeing softness with these consumers, while conversely, we are seeing strength with guests and higher income households. Even in this environment, our brands are made committed to our strategy to price below their competitors. Since we emerged from the height of the pandemic, you have heard us talk about the search for equilibrium or more normal business trends. During the quarter, we saw a return to historical seasonal patterns which we did not experience last year. As we have discussed in recent calls, finding that equilibrium will inform our brand's marketing strategies. As we execute our plans, we will be very selective in bringing any promotional activity back. And any promotional activity we introduced should be evaluated with the following filters. First, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations, which allows our teams to consistently deliver exceptional guest experiences. And finally, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests, but doing that in a way that drives profitable sales growth. As an example, Olive Garden's unique competitive advantage is never ending abundant craveable Italian food. That is why the television advertising progressed from spots that feature their never ending first course to those that are now focused on they're made from scratch sauces and anything they do going forward should continue to elevate this core brand equity. I am pleased with the progress our teams made executing against their strategic priorities during the quarter. Our strategy is working, enabling us to grow sales, increase market share and invest in our people and our brands all while continuing to earn -- to return capital to our shareholders. Last month, we held our annual leadership conferences, which provide a powerful way for us to engage with every general manager and managing partner across all 1,875 restaurants. These restaurant leaders hold the most influential role in our company and the opportunity to interact with them and listen to those closest to the action is invaluable. Our leaders return to their restaurants aligned to their brands operational priorities and motivated to continue winning. In order to win, we must stay focused on executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy and leveraging our four competitive advantages as we continue working in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. Our guests, our team members and the communities where we operate. One of the ways, we serve our communities is by fighting hunger. Once again this year, Darden is helping Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for 10 member food banks to support mobile pantry programs and food distribution in communities with the highest need. With the addition of these new trucks, 25 different food banks have received a truck since January of last year. Of course, our philanthropic giving would not be possible without the passion our restaurant teams have for nourishing and delighting our guests. On behalf of our leadership team and our Board of Directors, I want to thank our 180,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guests and communities. Now, I will turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone. We had strong absolute results in the first quarter and continue to be pleased with the efforts of our restaurant and support center teams to drive sales, effectively manage spending and navigate a challenging environment. We're lapping record first quarter performance from last year, which was driven by a resurgence in demand, more efficient labor with staffing levels below our standards and many other costs that had yet to be reintroduced into the business as we recovered from the impacts of the pandemic. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.4 billion, 6.1% higher than last year and driven by 4.2% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.56. Total EBITDA was $340 million, and we paid $150 million in dividends and repurchased $199 million in shares, returning a total of $349 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter. In the first quarter, total inflation was roughly 9.5% and total pricing was approximately 6.5%, almost 300 basis points below inflation. We expect total inflation and our gap between pricing and inflation to have peaked in the first quarter. We also expect inflation to moderate throughout the remainder of the year while our pricing gap should narrow in both the first and -- I'm sorry, both the second and third quarter and then reverts in the fourth quarter. And while we have commodities inflation risk in the back half of the year, we have pricing plans ready to put into action, which will help preserve our targeted gap to inflation for the year if we see inflation higher than our expectations. Consistent with what we expected and communicated in the June call, the significant level of pricing below inflation pressured all aspects of our P&L in the first quarter and drove margins well below last year. As we look to the second quarter, we expect margins to decline less than they did in the first quarter and then grow versus last year in the back half. Now looking at the details of the P&L compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 280 basis points higher, driven by commodities inflation of 15%. Restaurant labor was 50 basis points above last year, driven by hourly wage inflation of just over 9% and wrapping on last year's elevated productivity. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7.5%. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points above last year, driven by higher repairs and maintenance expense due to supply chain challenges and utilities inflation of 16%. Marketing spend was 20 basis points higher as we increased testing of both digital and television marketing. G&A expense was 130 basis points below last year, driven primarily by two factors. First, mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation plans was lower by about $7 million and as a reminder, this -- due to the way we hedge this expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line. Second, equity compensation expense related to retirement eligible individuals and our incentive accrual, while both in line with our plan were significantly less than last year. Operating income margin of 10% was 220 basis points below last year, but 60 basis points above pre-COVID levels. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%, and we ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $194 million. Now looking at our segments. All of our segments outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. And as Rick mentioned, we began seeing a return to normal seasonal sales patterns. This was evident in our monthly same-restaurant sales compared to last year when we did not experience typical seasonal softness. Same-restaurant sales for June were in the mid-3% range. July was in the low 1% range, and they were approximately 8% in August. Sales at Olive Garden were 3.7% above last year, and average weekly sales were 101% of the pre-COVID level despite the significant reduction in promotional activity and couponing versus that time period. As we talked about in the past, we believe the pre-COVID marketing and promotional activities historically drove double-digit traffic. And when we look at our average weekly traffic at Olive Garden, we're retaining over 90% of pre-COVID indicating that traffic trends are flat to above pre-COVID levels when considering historical marketing activities. LongHorn sales were 6.6% above last year, and average weekly sales were 126% of the pre-COVID level. Sales in our Fine Dining segment were 8.6% above last year, and average weekly sales were 120% of the pre-COVID levels. Our other segment sales were 9.9% above last year, and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-COVID levels. Despite all of our segments having higher sales above last year, the high levels of inflation and wrapping on last year's inflated earnings when many costs had not fully returned to the business, pressured segment profit margin below last year for all the segments. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We reiterated all aspects of our guidance in this morning's press release, culminating in diluted net earnings per share between $7.40 and $8 for the year. Finally, looking at the second quarter, we've seen continued strength in our sales trends with quarter-to-date sales above the high end of our annual same-restaurant sales outlook range. We also expect commodities inflation close to 13%, pressuring the second quarter EPS to be flat to slightly below last year. In what continues to be an unpredictable year, we're confident with the underlying strength of our business model and in our team's ability to effectively manage through it. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll begin with Brian Mullan with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Mullan: Hey. Thank you. Rick, in the prepared remarks, you referenced seeing some continued softness with the lower income consumers with the most exposure at Cheddar's and Olive Garden. Just to the degree you'd be able to comment, is that consumer feeling incrementally more pressure than they were when we heard from you three months ago or does it feel more stable to you right now? It would just be helpful to hear your thoughts given all the crosscurrents.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Brian. Thanks for the question. The consumer at the below $50,000 is feeling a little bit worse than maybe before, but gas prices are helping. So if you think about that consumer at $50,000 a year and below, gas prices make up a big portion of their income. And actually, that consumer spends more money on gas per person than any other income group above them. So as gas prices came down, they started feeling a little bit better, but we'll see what happens with gas prices going forward. And if I can clarify one other thing that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I said that To Go sales were 32% -- I'm sorry, digital sales were 32% To Go of off-premise. They were actually 62%. So sorry about that.\nBrian Mullan: Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up question on marketing. You did touch on how you'll approach it from here, if you were to bring it back. But if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit on how you will approach that. I know the goal is to make sure you're driving restaurant profit dollars for the organization. But maybe from a capability perspective or from how you measure ROI, is there anything different going forward than maybe how you would have did this three or four years ago as you bring it back -- if you do bring it back?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. I'm not going to get into detail on if we're bringing it back. As I did say in the prepared remarks, if and when they introduce promotional activity, it should elevate brand equity in which we've been doing for the last year or so at Olive Garden, it should be simple to execute and not be at a deep discount. Our goal with anything we do promotional activity or anything else we do to drive sales is profitable sales growth and we have ways to measure ROI. The things that we learned through COVID and even -- and we knew before when LongHorn started to reduce their kind of limited time offer price point, deep discounted promotions is there was a lot of work involved in getting items that we don't usually have in the restaurant, getting that through the supply chain, training it. And so there were a lot of costs there. And so as we think about future potential kind of communication methods and the way we talk about our products and promote, as I said, is going to be things that don't make it more complicated, much more complicated in the restaurant, but it has to focus on our brand equities and not be a deep discount.\nOperator: We'll now move to our next question, which will come from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One, just on the near-term results. I'm just wondering how did the actual comp and earnings compare to internal expectation for the first quarter. And as you think about fiscal 2023, I know the guidance was unchanged, but it would seem like the lower end more likely in a slowing macro. I'm just wondering whether we're missing something in terms of your expectation for a comp reacceleration or more significant inflation easing or more cost savings. Just trying to get a sense for the first quarter relative to the rest of the year?\nRaj Vennam: Hi, Jeff. This is Raj. So when we think about our plan and our actual internal expectations and our estimate, we're basically just -- told the board that we're basically back on plan. We're really in line with our internal expectations. As we look specifically at the quarter, was there a little bit of a miss on the sales side? Yes, but not as big as you guys might think. And then overall, profitability was in line and actually slightly ahead. But again, quarter-to-quarter, there is some volatility. As the quarter started or as the year started, we started to see the seasonality return to normal and that was really one of the things that changed how we thought about the business. And if you look at versus pre-COVID, how we trended, the traffic retention was actually pretty similar in Q1 to the way it was in Q4. So there's a lot of noise when you look at year-over-year because of the reopening last year and especially if you think about California that reopened in the middle of June or late June that helped Olive Garden and, to some extent, Yard House, you're wrapping on those levels. So that's why there's a lot of noise year-over-year. But I think the best way to look at it is versus pre-COVID. And when we look at it through that lens, Q1 was actually, like I said, pretty consistent with the performance we had in Q4.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just to follow up, the comps. I think you mentioned in August, you were running roughly or you ran roughly 8%. That seems like a significant acceleration versus the June and July, and I think you said in September, you're running above the 4% to 6% that you guided for the full year. So I'm just wondering if you can share any thoughts in terms of why you think you saw such a sharp reacceleration versus maybe June and July, I didn't know if it's just all that compares on a multi-year basis or maybe, Rick, as you mentioned, the easing gas price is helping. Just trying to get your thoughts on the reacceleration and your directional assumption for the rest of the year. Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. I think I would, again, go back to the reference to pre-COVID. And if you actually look at it through that lens, you're going to find that August, while year-over-year was higher, it wasn't that big of an increase versus pre-COVID. Is there a movement of a point or two between the month-to-month when you look at it versus pre-COVID? Yes. But in general, we're actually fairly consistent, and I think it's just -- I know it's hard because it's three years ago, but that's really the baseline you got to look at. If you look at it through that lens, our cadence actually looks pretty reasonable. It doesn't look like there's a huge acceleration. Now, there are some specific things related to unique -- in the promotional activity for the brand that when we wrap on that, the pre-COVID retention might be a little different. And that is part of how we look at it, and we take that into consideration as we estimate the business. And that's where you see the retention may be a little bit different month-to-month because of the promotional activity we might be wrapping on versus pre-COVID. But when you exclude that, in general, it's actually been fairly consistent and our estimate essentially assumes that going forward.\nOperator: We'll now move to our next question, which will come from John Glass, Morgan Stanley.\nJohn Glass: Thanks very much, and good morning. Rick, first of all, can you just talk about the competitive intensity, promotional intensity in the industry. Everyone presumably is seeing the same pressure on the low-end consumer. So are you seeing more of competitive activity, versus I heard some of your competitors talk about reducing promotional activity just to repair their margins. So there's a lot of crosscurrents here. How do you perceive what's going on in the industry from a competitive intensity standpoint right now?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. We aren't seeing a lot of significant promotional activity. Other than a couple out there, there's one brand out there doing an all you can eat promotion that they did before COVID at the same price point. There's another brand out there doing an all you can eat promotion at a much significantly higher price point than pre-COVID. But I think you mentioned it, margins are challenged in a lot of these competitors. And so the ability for them to do significant discounted promotions to drive traffic may not be something that they do. Now, if food costs come way down, they might start talking about promotions and price points. But the margins that you see out there versus pre-COVID might make it a little bit harder for them to do some significant deep discounting.\nJohn Glass: That's great. And then you talked about your own low-end consumer, particularly at Olive Garden being under pressure. Do you intend to target those consumers to stimulate the return to your restaurants or do you view this as like, look, right now, they're not probably dining out as much and so no matter what you do, it doesn't really change their outlook on dining? How do you think about recapturing those visits?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. I think a couple of things. One is, let's not read into it that we're seeing a huge, huge reduction in that consumer. We're seeing a little bit of change in the behavior from that consumer, but not huge. And so we don't want to change what we do just to capture a segment of the population. We want to continue to focus on what we've been doing, especially at Olive Garden is to earn one more visit from our loyal guests. And our loyal guests span a lot of income levels. And so anything we do is going to help drive more loyalty from our existing guests, whether they are at below $50,000 or above $50,000. Remember, we said that $50,000 income consumers make up a portion of Olive Garden, but it's not a majority. And so, a majority of our consumers still are above that, and that consumer, especially above $100,000 is doing very well.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll now take a question from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs.\nJared Garber: Great. Thank you for the question. Raj, I wanted to ask about the commodity inflation and the outlook maybe from here for the next three months to six months. I think you said there's some risk in the back half of the year. And it seems like maybe the second quarter inflation guide is a bit higher than what we have been expecting based, I guess, on some recent commentary. So, wanted to just get a sense of what you're seeing and how you're contracting forward, and then maybe when we can start expecting maybe some inflation easing, particularly on beef, I think we've seen some easing in the inflationary environment on some of the costs there. So, I just wanted to get a sense of how you're planning for that to flow through throughout the year. Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Jared. I think, first of all, I want to remind you that the commodities inflation, when we talk about inflation is really a function of what we purchased last year at what price. And for us, I'll take one great example is, we had a great chicken contract. I think we were buying boneless chicken breast in the range of, call it, mid-$1 range and as you all know, I think over two, three months ago, the price of that was as much as $3.50. And I think this week, it's come down to almost $1.80, $1.85, right? So, it's come down a lot. The pricing level, we are definitely seeing the movement in the right direction. But we had expected some of that to happen as we guided. And in fact, directionally, things are moving consistent with what we expected, maybe not as quite as fast as we thought. But it's not that far off. I mean our commodities inflation for the year -- at the beginning of the year, we said we're around 7%. We're probably looking at closer to 7.5%, but that's not a huge change given the volatility we've had in the market. But as we get to the back half, we do wrap on some of these elevated costs. And so, as we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do expect, as we get into Q3, to be more in that mid-single digit range. And as we get to Q4, probably more close to flat to slightly deflationary year-over-year. The other thing is we have -- our coverage, it's really still hard to get coverage too far out. And as you can saw from this morning, I think we showed it in the amount of coverage in our slides here. I think we have 50% coverage over the next six months. And in fact, when you look at the next three months, that's just over 70% but then after that, it's only -- it's closer to 30% coverage. And so, it's still hard to get -- the forward premiums are still high, and we -- especially when things are coming down, we don't want to lock ourselves and not have that optionality. But again, as I said in my comments earlier, if it ends up being a little bit higher, we have headroom in pricing to be able to deal with that.\nJared Garber: Thanks.\nOperator: We'll now move to Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Go ahead, please.\nChris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Raj, I was hoping you could just level set us for the second quarter. The comps you said were above the 4% to 6% range quarter-to-date. But, if the comps relative to pre-COVID are pretty steady for the rest of the quarter, would that imply much variation?\nRaj Vennam: So, I think, much variation -- I want to make sure I understand the question right. When you say much variation from like month-to-month within the quarter, if that's the case, yes, there is some, because of -- again, if you look at -- I have to go back, look at exactly the pre-COVID numbers. But I know that, like I was mentioning earlier, there is the promotional activity that you have to take into consideration as a base. So when we look at pre-COVID, we tease out the impact of promotions and look at that, and that's how I -- we say that's fairly consistent when you look at it, taking out the impact of the promotional activity from then to now. But are we seeing that versus pre-COVID or are we a little bit better September to-date? Yeah, but it's not meaningful -- it's not big enough to really call it a trend change.\nChris O'Cull: Okay. I was just trying to figure out if October, November comparisons relative to COVID or pre-COVID or relative to last year even are much different from what you have in September, you're wrapping in September.\nRaj Vennam: I don't believe so. I'm trying to think if there is a holiday shift in November, but that's the only thing I can think of. But I don't think there's any change. Yeah.\nChris O'Cull: Okay. And then assuming the holiday is following -- assuming the holiday is following a more normal seasonal pattern this year, which of your brands do you expect to be impacted the most on a year-over-year basis? For example, I would think fine dining's performance might accelerate if we have a normal holiday season, but I wasn't sure how all the brands might be impacted.\nRaj Vennam: Actually, I think by the time we got to the holiday season last year, obviously Omicron was a factor that started to kick in late into the holidays, and we expect third quarter to be an outperformer on the comp side because of that wrap on that. But outside of that, when we look at our segments, I don't know that there's anything unique that this year holiday wrap that would cause them to be different from where we were before COVID. And I just want to remind you, last year, December was a record sales month for us. It was really -- the Omicron impact was kind of basically the last week of December leading into January.\nOperator: We'll now move to our next question. That will come from Dennis Geiger with UBS.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks for the question. I appreciate the details and the commentary on pricing. Just wondering if you could speak to what you've seen to-date as far as the customer response to the pricing and kind of how that impacts your go-forward thoughts, obviously, marrying that up with how you spoke to inflation.\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. I'd say, generally, the pricing flow-through is consistent with what we would expect. I think, Rick mentioned earlier, when you look at the lower income, is there a little bit of erosion on the add-ons? Yes, but it's not meaningful enough for us to say that there's a pushback on pricing, but mind you, we're pricing a lot less than our competitors. And as you think about the fact that the last quarter, our pricing was 6.5% roughly that compares to full-service CPI of 9%. And in fact, and then -- and I'll just point out that when you look at it over a two-year basis, we price 7.5%. And I think, FSR is close to 14% on a two-year. And that just gives you a sense of the fact that we may not be seeing what some others might be seeing, because we haven't taken the levels of pricing that the industry in general has taken.\nDennis Geiger: Right. Appreciate that. And then just I'm wondering if you could speak to dining room traffic levels currently. Where that stands? What kind of runway you may still have within the dining room and the benefits there, if To Go stays elevated? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Well, I think we've said in the past, there's not a huge difference in profitability between dining room versus take off-premise. The margin differential is de minimis across the portfolio. Is there some difference from brand to brand? Yes. But when you look at through the portfolio, the levels of profitability is not that different. And as we look at -- if you're looking at what the impact might have if the mix changes, I wouldn't say that changes the margin that much. And again, we -- two quarters in a row, now we are seeing consistent off-premise level. So, we'll have to see how that plays out over time. But I don't expect the margin to change materially based on the change in mix.\nOperator: David Tarantino with Baird has our next question. Please go ahead.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. Raj, I just want to clarify a couple of comments you made on the underlying sales trends. So, my question really is specific to Olive Garden and how you're viewing the performance for the first quarter relative to what you were seeing prior to the first quarter. It sounds like maybe you aren't viewing it that differently, but I just wanted to clarify just the way we would calculate kind of multiyear comps. It did look like a slowdown, but then you did have that promotional activity pre-COVID. So I guess, when you sort of make all the adjustments you're making for Olive Garden specifically, how are you viewing the performance of that brand in the first quarter?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, David. Look, we're actually very pleased with the work that Olive Garden team has done in keeping with their strategy. And I'll tell you, as we look at our guest count retention, which is the way we look at it, Q4 Olive Garden guest count retention was in that low-90s, call it 91%, 91-ish and in the first quarter, they were basically in that range. So they're within 0.5 point of what Q4 was. Was there -- I think year-over-year, there are a lot of dynamics, which is why I think there's a little bit of that confusion as well. But when you look at it on a three-year, traffic retention from Q4 to Q1 at Olive Garden was pretty consistent. And then, the other thing I'll point out is Q1 before COVID, what we're comparing to is the quarter where we had buy one, take one for nine weeks of the -- eight or nine weeks of the quarter. And then we also had a big launch of a second promotion that had high TRPs and couponing. And in fact, so when you actually exclude all that, we feel like Olive Garden was actually in a great place. And that's the point we're trying to make is that, I don't think -- we are -- us being close to the business and understanding the details, when we take out those noise -- take that noise out, Olive Garden's performance has been pretty consistent.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. That's helpful. And then on the quarter-to-date number, I think you said last year, you were doing comps versus pre-COVID around 7%, if I'm not mistaken. So, if you're north of 6% versus that number, it would imply a pretty big acceleration versus what we've seen in recent quarters. And it didn't sound like you were viewing it that way. So I guess, could you reconcile that math for us in your comments that maybe you haven't seen an inflection?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, David. I think a couple of things. One, you got to take into consideration the pricing difference between over three years from the first quarter to the second quarter. Then I think when we look at traffic, yeah, I mean it does -- like I was mentioning earlier, there is a little bit of an increase versus pre-COVID. But when we take out the impact from promotions from three years ago, it's not a huge step change. So that's the other part that I think you're missing is like September, three years ago, we did not have the same level of promotional activity at Olive Garden as we did in June and August -- or the first quarter of this year. So that's another factor that plays into how we look at it.\nOperator: Now moving to a question from Peter Saleh with BTIG.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks. Appreciate all the color. I just wanted to come back to that conversation around the guest count consistency at Olive Garden and just kind of pair that with the commentary you guys made earlier. So just trying to understand, I think last quarter, Rick, you had mentioned that there was some check management at Cheddar's. I think this quarter, you're talking about some slowdown or weakness with the consumer under $50,000 of income. Just trying to understand how that's manifesting itself right now in these two brands. Is it more traffic declines or is it check management? Just trying to understand that in the context of what Raj just indicated on guest count retention at Olive Garden.\nRick Cardenas: Hey. Thanks, Peter. All right. We're getting a lot of questions on traffic at Olive Garden. I just want to reiterate, we're really proud of the work Olive Garden has done and Dan has done and the team over the last couple of years. What they've done to simplify their operation, to improve margins over time, over pre-COVID has been great. They outperformed the industry this year, this quarter in both sales and traffic. And as I shared in our prepared remarks, within our portfolio, they have more consumers at below $50,000. That doesn't mean that we're worried about the below $50,000 consumer because it hasn't been a significant move in traffic from that. Yes, we've seen some check management a little bit. And as we've said, it's not significant. So, our media is a lot lower. There's a lot of reasons for the performance at Olive Garden and the performance at Cheddar's. But we haven't seen much check management, maybe a little bit at Cheddar's.\nPeter Saleh: Understood. Okay. Very helpful. And then just on the marketing expense for the full year, I think you guys had indicated previously, maybe that would be up about 10 basis points. I think in the first quarter, it was up about 20 basis points. Are you still on track for maybe just a modest increase this year or do you think you guys will maybe take that up slightly given the trends so far in the first quarter?\nRaj Vennam: Peter, this is -- actually, I don't think it has anything to do with the first quarter trends. But as we look at our plans, I think we're basically within that 10 basis points to 20 basis points, and quarter to quarter, it might vary. But you might see some quarters at 20 basis points, some at 10 basis points, but that's still what we expect to do for the year.\nPeter Saleh: Thank you very much.\nOperator: We will now hear from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks. [Technical Difficulty] I think there may be some confusion in how you're talking about (ph) trends relative to pre-COVID because clearly\nKevin Kalicak: Brian, your line is breaking up. Can you clear your line?\nBrian Bittner: Can you hear me? Hello?\nOperator: We hear you better now. Go ahead.\nBrian Bittner: Okay. So you can hear me, okay. I just -- I think I want to address, I think there's some confusion in how you're talking about trends relative to pre-COVID. Because clearly, we as the analyst have no way to strip out impacts of promotions like you do when we speak to your underlying trend and you speak to it excluding promotions, it\u2019s kind of apples versus oranges to our models. So like for instance, if you hold anywhere near this 6% comp for 2Q, it would suggest 400 basis points of acceleration in the pre-COVID trend from where you were in the first quarter. And so I think what we're trying to figure out is there's something happening that's more positive in the business recently than you're leading on or conversely should we expect that one-year trend to come down a lot moving forward to kind of keep that multi-stack trend intact, if that makes sense.\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Brian. I mean, I understand where you're coming from. But I think there's so much uncertainty in this environment for us to basically say that what we saw in the last three weeks or four weeks and then just to be able to say that should be the new number, and that's how we should look at it for the full year. That doesn't make sense. If we look at what happened over the last six months, consistently there's a little bit of movement from week to week. But when you come back and look at it over a larger period of time, call it six or eight weeks, it's pretty consistent. And that's really what we're looking at it through that lens. And I get the point around the promotions, and you don't have visibility to some of that. But even if you just look at the absolute number, I think for Q1 -- Q4, it was, like I said, 91%, 91% to 92%, and Q1 was basically 91% of pre-COVID at Olive Garden, for example. So it's actually pretty consistent from Q4 to Q1 at an absolute quarter level. Month-to-month, week-to-week, there is some volatility, but that's really -- that's where the promotions come into play.\nBrian Bittner: Okay. And just going back to the first quarter on Olive Garden, I know you were happy with its performance and again stripping out the promotions, great noise in how you look at it versus us. But obviously versus the quarter before, it did slow materially in the trend versus \u201819 or versus pre-COVID, whereas all the other segments and brands really held steady. And I guess the question is does Olive Garden have a bigger return to seasonality factor in its business and the other brands? And also, what percentage of Olive Garden is exposed to that under $50,000 consumer relative to the other brands?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Brian. So Olive Garden did not have a different seasonal pattern than the other brands, so the seasonality pattern was very consistent with Olive Garden with LongHorn and Cheddar's. The difference in kind of the two -- the three year difference or pre-COVID difference, as was something that Raj said. In the summer of 2019, we had buy one, take one in the first quarter at Olive Garden. It was the first time we did it in the first quarter. So it was about, I think, a 2 point swing that we had from Q4 to Q1. But the seasonality was very consistent across when you compare. As the $50,000 income, Cheddar's and Olive Garden are fairly consistent. They're a little bit higher than they are at LongHorn. But it's not anywhere near the majority. And so we're not going to give you an exact number, but it is higher than LongHorn, but it's not significantly higher.\nBrian Bittner: Okay. Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Sure.\nOperator: Andrew Charles with Cowen has the next question. Go ahead.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Given the return of seasonality in the industry that could weigh on Olive Garden seasonally like fiscal 2Q, within the reiterated revenue guidance though, what gives you confidence that you'll see the benefit of seasonality in fiscal 3Q and fiscal 4Q the strongest fiscal quarter -- the strongest seasonal quarters for the business as the consumer backdrop, particularly at the low end, is a bit shaky here?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. Well, when we talk about return to seasonality, it's based on the consumer backdrop there is today, it's not necessary -- if something changes dramatically, you might see some different seasonal patterns. But my guess is you'll still see the same flows month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. It just might be a little bit lower, a little bit higher depending on where the consumer is. The only difference that we'll see -- and that's versus pre-COVID. When you think about versus last year, we are going to have the Omicron wrap that we have in January basically and a little bit of February. So that should help versus last year on a Q3 basis. But as we talk about seasonality, it's really more about the consumer returning more to normal based on COVID, not on the economy, because we're basically assuming that the economy stays somewhere around where we are. If it gets a little worse, that might impact inflation in a positive way for us. And as we said in the call in the first quarter, if food costs go down 1%, it's better -- it offsets a 2% decline in guest count. I'm sorry, if total inflation goes down 1%, it impacts -- it's the same impact as a 2% change in guest count.\nAndrew Charles: Thank you.\nOperator: And Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse has the next question. Go ahead, please.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you very much. I have a quick follow-up on Olive Garden. So it seems like the headwinds in the reduction and discounting impact were outsized in the fiscal first quarter, given all the promotions. To be clear, excluding the promotions, were three-year trends closer to positive mid-single digit and is that what you'd expect for the rest of the year?\nRick Cardenas: I would say on three-year trends in sales, we would be positive even more than that because we were positive to three years ago in sales right now. On the traffic side, what we've said in the past is the marketing activity and the spending that we've done in marketing is probably around a 10% impact to traffic. And Raj mentioned that in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter, we were in the low-90s to traffic to pre-COVID, and that's mostly driven by all of the media that we did before and the coupons and all the other things. But it was something that we wanted to do, and we expected to see some traffic miss from that. And so total sales would be higher and guest count would be higher if we were in the same kind of marketing mix we were before.\nLauren Silberman: Understood. And then just -- I wanted to ask about on-premise traffic across the industry. It's still down despite closures. Any perspective on why that might be the case and which occasions still haven't fully recovered, especially as we enter what seems to be an increasingly challenging consumer environment?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. I think a couple of things. The off-premise experience is a lot better across a lot of places. So, people have other ways to get their food from casual dining than they did before. And so that could lead to a little bit less dining room traffic, especially as there are still some consumers that don't want to go out to eat. While a lot of people think COVID is over, there are some that don't. And so even with restaurant closures, a lot of the closures happen in independents in urban markets. And so some of the suburban markets are still doing well and they didn't have as many closures. So -- but what Raj was mentioning earlier, with margins being basically the same for us on off-premise versus on-premise, because we don't have that delivery charge, then we're okay wherever it is. We want our dining rooms to be more full, and you're starting to see them fill up. Not all the brands are back to pre-COVID levels. LongHorn is above pre-COVID levels in traffic. And so we feel good about all of our brands and what they're going to do. The good news is if our dining rooms aren't back to full, we've got capacity. And as we continue to see some improvement, as we continue to do the things that we have been doing over the last few years, focusing on simplification, making it easier for our teams to do what they do, investing in our food, investing in our teams, then we're going to have an even better experience as guests come back, and they are coming back. So, that just gives us more opportunity to grow in the long run because our dining rooms in some of our brands aren't back to pre-COVID levels. That's being offset in most of our brands by To Go.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Moving to Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett.\nJeff Farmer: Thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. So, can you update us on where you see G&A dollars for the full year considering what we saw in the Q1?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Jeff. I think for the full year, we're probably still close to that $400 million, which is where I think we were before COVID. So, three years of inflation and other things, growth costs all help offset the corporate restructuring savings of over $25 million or so that we got. So, I would say, at this point, our estimate is closer to that $400 million for the full year.\nJeff Farmer: Okay. And then there were a couple of mentions about this. But as we approach that January-February timeframe when you saw the most significant Omicron headwinds, is there any color you can provide on the magnitude of sales headwind that you potentially saw over that January and February time period?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. I think last year, if you go back, we talked about that impacting sales by about $100 million -- call it, in that $90 million to $100 million range. So that's really the tailwind as you look at it year-over-year on the sales front.\nJeff Farmer: Okay. Appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll now move to Jon Tower with Citi. Go ahead, please.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two for me. First, Rick, your comments earlier in the prepared remarks and answering some of the questions about promotions only coming back on if they're profitable. Does that mean that we may see historical promos of the past show up again, but priced at a level that's more profitable to Darden, so for example, I'm thinking like Never Ending Pasta at Olive Garden?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Jon. We're not going to discuss our plans for competitive reasons. But as we've said a few times today, anything that we do should emphasize our brand equity and be more profitable than they were before.\nJon Tower: Okay. And then I guess just following up another comment earlier in the call, the idea that you're seeing strength in that higher income households for those over $50,000. Can you just talk about how that's showing up in the business either across the brands or within brands? Are you seeing, say, for example, higher traffic growth at Olive Garden in that subsegment or is it more about the check growth? Just curious if you could suss that out a little bit.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Jon. I think there's a few ways to kind of tease that out. One is look at our Fine Dining business and how well they're doing and the sales that they've had. Even though in the first quarter, the urban markets hadn't reopened yet really much and a lot of people hadn't gone back to work. We had a significant difference in Fine Dining in the suburban markets versus the urban markets. That's tightening now with people going back to work. But Fine Dining is doing really well. Many of our other brands in the other segment, you've got Yard House, you've got Seasons 52 doing very well because of that consumer. And at Olive Garden, our mix has changed and so our consumer is a little bit higher. And so think about LongHorn. LongHorn caters to a little bit higher consumer and their sales are still strong, and traffic is still strong versus pre-COVID. So there's a lot of ways to see it. And we're seeing the ability as we take price in some of the Fine Dining brands, there's really no pushback. So we think that that is a broad-based benefit for us because we have a portfolio of brands that kind of run the spectrum of the consumer. And so when one segment of the population isn't doing as well, the other segment is, then we are still okay. And then if it flips the other way, we're okay. And so right now, there's just one segment of the population that's being hurt a little bit more by inflation than others. And the good news is we've got brands that aren't impacted by that.\nJon Tower: Thank you.\nOperator: Moving on to Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Go ahead, please.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just maybe one about your guidance. It was encouraging to see that you reiterate all the components of the outlook. Raj, last quarter, you commented that the guidance implies full year margin in 2023 will exceed that of pre-COVID levels. But if I look at where things fell in the first quarter, the 17.5% was about 50 bps or 60 bps below where you were in the first quarter of 2020. So the question is, do you still expect those store-level margin to exceed pre-COVID levels for the full year? And second, can you give us a bit more color on how you expect the margin to progress throughout the year and what some of the levers outside of pricing that you can pull to bring it back up?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Eric. Let's say, we always talk about margins at the operating profit level or EBITDA level. The reason we do that is because there's a lot of difference. If we manage G&A better, that give us flexibility to put more costs into the investment into the four walls. So we don't focus as much on the four walls as the full because for us, at the end of the day, it's the total portfolio, right? Where are we for the whole P&L? Where are we from an EBIT margin, where are we from an EBITDA margin. If you look at it through that lens, first quarter was higher than pre-COVID by about, call it, 60 basis points on the profit level and 40 basis points when you look at it through EBITDA, so let me start with that. And then as we look at the full year, do we still expect restaurant-level margins to be better than pre-COVID? Yes, that's what's embedded in our guidance for the full year. The cadence of that is going to be that we have -- if you recall last year, the first and second quarter had the most improvement versus pre-COVID. So that's why you saw a year-over-year decline in the first quarter. We expect that to narrow a little bit in the second quarter, but still decline versus last year, but still ahead of pre-COVID. And then as we get to the back half, we expect to be higher than last year. That's what's embedded in our guidance. And part of that is the shrinking gap between pricing and inflation. And again, this was planful as we went into this year. And so we expect -- at this point, we expect it to play out that way.\nEric Gonzalez: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Andrew Strelzik with BMO.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to the value and pricing discussion. And you noted -- I know I'm asking this question amid all the inflation, but you noted chicken breast prices having come back and you mentioned that beef having -- prices having come back. So I guess if we do go into kind of a more deflationary environment, you do see commodity costs really pull back. How do you think about promoting value throughout your brands? And do you feel like we end up in a position where maybe we're offside from a value perspective as maybe a casual dining group? I know we used to talk about food at home, food away from home. I don't know if you -- how you think about that risk, but just curious for your thoughts on the levers, maybe if we were to go into that scenario.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. If we're going to in a scenario that food costs deflate even more or reduce even more than we have in our estimate already, because remember, what I've said in the June call and even today is we continue to expect food cost to go down, the inflation to go down from where it was in the first quarter. And I'm assuming that our competitors are assuming the same thing. That said, we don't anticipate changing our messaging to be a pure value play. We think we have value on all of our brands every day based on the investments that we've made in our food, the improvement that we have in our service, and our brands are going to talk about whichever ones do any kind of communication, they're equities. And at Olive Garden, it's never ending craveable abundant Italian food. At LongHorn, its quality and they talk about quality. It doesn't have -- they don't have to talk about price. And at our other brands, we talk about -- at Cheddar's, it is about (ph) value. So if Cheddar's talks more in digitally, it will be about value because that's their equity. So we're not going to change our marketing based on what's happening with food cost. We're going to market based on our strategy.\nAndrew Strelzik: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I apologize if I missed this. You mentioned staffing being back kind of to normal levels. But can you just give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of turnover and application flow? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. We continue to get a significant increase in applicant flow across the country. We have a new talent management system. We've had it for over a year. And that system allows applicants to automatically schedule their interviews, et cetera., and we've got so many interviews scheduled. We're going to have to figure out how to maybe slow that down because managers, all they're doing is interviewing in a lot of places. So we've got a really good applicant flow. As we said, we opened quite a few restaurants this quarter. All of them were fully staffed with great people ready to go. Our turnover, our manager retention is much closer to pre-COVID levels. It's pretty close to pre-COVID levels and well better than the industry average, our manager retention. And our team member retention is also well above the industry, but it's not quite back to pre-COVID levels. So our teams are focused. And as we mentioned, we had our general manager/managing partner conferences last month. And most of those conferences we're talking about ensuring that we train our new team members and improve retention. We think that's a key for us going forward, and we'll continue to focus on trying to get our retention levels back to pre-COVID levels.\nOperator: We'll now move to our next question. That will come from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. I think you said all traffic at Olive Garden is down 9% versus pre-COVID. Raj, I think you said that that's the inverse of the 91%. And if To Go mix was up maybe 9 points since then, the dining room traffic would be down more than that, maybe mid-teens or something like that. So maybe you can confirm if that's about right. But I'm wondering how much you look at that traffic gap in the dining room versus pre-COVID is an opportunity that you can invest against in a good ROI type of fashion versus traffic that was simply not profitable and not worth chasing with TV advertising, LTOs or coupons because just not efficient spend and you've got a healthy reset with COVID.\nRaj Vennam: Yes, David. I think let me start by saying your numbers are right. That's accurate. The -- yes, does that present an opportunity in the dining room? Absolutely. But we're going to go about it in a manner that's actually sustainable and that's where we go back to -- over the last three years, we've invested so much into underpricing inflation. If you look at where Olive Garden's pricing has been over the three years, combined -- full three years combined is at 10%. When you look at where full-service CPI -- restaurant CPI was for the same timeframe, it's 17.5%. So we've actually significantly underpriced the industry and actually, I would argue, significantly underpriced, maybe not to the same extent our competitors. So that is the way we believe to build back that guest. And Rick mentioned getting that one extra visit from our loyal guest, we think this is a sustainable, durable way to really get our guests back, it's going to take time. It's not a one magic, let's drive people in today or tomorrow. It's just going to happen over time. And I would argue that we're starting to see the fruit of some of that, but it takes time.\nRick Cardenas: And I just want to add one thing, David, which is what you said. Some of those guests that we were doing in these dining rooms might not have been as profitable as we'd like, right? We had a lot of coupons. There were times when we had five coupons in one week at Olive Garden, when we were running never any possible, right? And so we had to ask ourselves, is that the right thing to do to drive traffic, just to have a full restaurant if that traffic really isn't very profitable. We do a lot of work when they're there. And so are we better off with a loyal guest that doesn't need all of those discounts to come in, and we can serve them. They know what they're going to get. They get a consistent experience. So everything Raj said, I agree with, but our strategy is to -- we've significantly reduced discounting. It's such a small part of the number of checks, very, very minimal, and we'd like to keep it that way.\nDavid Palmer: The other comment that you said in the opening comments, I think you said that customer satisfaction levels were near highs. I don't know if there -- I'd have to go back and check, but what brands maybe we're talking about there, that's pretty striking because I think the industry customer satisfaction levels are near lows. I mean they've kind of gotten roughed up by a tough labor market, so are you finding that you've sort of your gap to the peers has dramatically shifted and the reason I ask that is because given your strategy, we see obviously best-in-class operators, they have very thin marketing and promotion budgets. So to some degree, if there might be a return on the customer set gap that you might be thinking about at this point. Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, David. We specifically mentioned Olive Garden being at or near record highs, and we talked about LongHorn having their stakes grow correctly at record, but I would tell you that Cheddar's is at a record high for us in the time that we've owned them. They've got the highest satisfaction. They've got the lowest dissatisfaction they've ever had. We've got the same thing at Olive Garden, high satisfaction at LongHorn. I believe they're at their highest overall ratings or if not at the highest, are as close as they've been because cooking the steak right is a big part of satisfaction. At our other brands, at Seasons 52, satisfaction is really high. So we haven't really seen -- we've actually bucked the trend on consumer satisfaction, not just in the category. If you look at consumer satisfaction or customer satisfaction over the last few years, it's been on a decline. Ours is not. And we think it's because of what we've done over the last few years and even the last five or 10 years to continue to improve our guest experience to continue to add more value on the plate and to be consistent. We've got a core group of team members that work in every one of our restaurants that have been there a long time. Our restaurants are fully staffed in general. We've got pockets of restaurants that are understaffed, but those are the same kind of pockets that we had before COVID. And so we believe that the things that we've done over the last few years have helped improve guest satisfaction because we've got great loyalty members. So is that part of the reason that we aren't -- we don't have to do as much versus others on the marketing front? Perhaps. But what I would say, it gives us even more confidence that if we do turn on some media that we're going to execute really well and delight even more people.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks.\nOperator: And with Bank of America, Sara Senatore. Please go ahead.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. Just two follow-ups, please. One, you made the point that your collective gap between food away from home and your own pricing has been quite wide, but you also said that you expect that gap or your inflation -- your input inflation and your pricing gap to narrow. So I guess is there a -- which presumably means your gap with -- the collective gap with the CPI overall will also narrow. Is there like sort of a specific ratio you'd like to keep or I guess how do you think about that, the importance of having that very wide gap, but at the same time, seeing it narrow a little bit as perhaps support for margin? So just that was one question. And then my second question is just on margins overall as you think about versus pre-COVID, I guess, my sense is that the big changes are in Cheddar's in particular. But as we think about kind of structural earnings power, what's the right segment margin, can you give any guidance among -- across the different segments, Olive Garden, LongHorn and then the Fine Dining and Other? Just to get a sense of what normalized earnings should look like by segment? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Okay, Sara. That's a lot. So let me start with the pricing gap first, and then I'll get into the margins. So the comment we were making was specifically quarter-to-quarter movement in the year. But what we're targeting for the year is about 100 basis points gap to our inflation. This is not necessarily reflecting the food away from home or that, but I don't anticipate that our gap to the full-service restaurant CPI will shrink. This is more about what's going to happen over the -- by a lot. Maybe is there a 50 basis points movement? Sure. But is it going to shrink a lot? No. What we're talking about is we are targeting for the year, as we said at the beginning of the year, we said approximately 6% inflation -- total inflation and approximately 5% pricing. And we're continuing to -- we're just saying that we'll continue that. But the gap is the largest in the first quarter. It's really a function of year-over-year and the commodities being at those highest levels. So as they come down, the gap to that inflation will narrow and might actually even reverse a little bit in one quarter in the fourth quarter. But the point here is that when you look at it over time, our gap is still pretty wide. And we expect that to remain that wide relative to the full-service CPI and implied also relative to competitors. So that's the thing on the pricing side. As far as margins versus pre-COVID, our guidance implies that our margins will be less than last year; however, they will be still higher than pre-COVID. It still implies, call it, 40 to 50 basis points erosion versus last year for the full year. However, on the -- versus pre-COVID still somewhere close to 150 basis points is what that implies. As far as individual segments, I think the benefit of the portfolio is that our ability to react differently to different situations. And so to the extent, we have -- we don't want to put a specific target by segment, because that really boxes us into a corner. And the way we would think about it is if the consumer on the high end is doing well, maybe we get a little bit more margin from there and invest in the places where we need to. And so, we're thinking long term to get to this portfolio number, but we continue to kind of really evaluate that and play it by the year based on the environment. And so we want to just be more nimble on that front.\nSara Senatore: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Now, we'll move to a question from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Thank you. Good morning. So first question, I'd like to understand a bit better on kind of the markers that you're looking for, for the marketing expense to accelerate as a percent of sales, in particular, if it's not kind of additional softness in traffic, what are the markets that you're looking for?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. I would say that this year, our marketing is going to be 10 basis points to 20 basis points above last year. What are specific markers we're looking at to significantly increase marketing? There's quite a few. One is we're going to continue to -- we're testing right now in some digital marketing and other media to see which one drives the best ROI. And when we feel like it's time to turn that on, we will. We're going to make sure that our turnover is back to a more reasonable level. Our guest experience is still great. But there's no one individual marker that we're going to say this -- when this happens, we're going to turn on media. We just don't want to let our competitors know what the markers are.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Thank you. And then the follow-up on unit growth. So, we noticed that on a Fine Dining basis, there was a reduction of -- a net reduction of 3 units. So, I'm wondering, is there going to be a different composition in terms of kind of the plan of your portfolio going forward or was the reduction just a kind of a quarterly reduction that you don't expect in the longer run?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. A couple of things. One, we had one of our restaurants catch fire and it had to close temporarily. But yeah -- and we have -- yeah, we moved Capital Burger into the other segment versus Fine Dining before, and there's three Capital Burgers in there. But we opened a restaurant in Fine Dining, but we only had one total closure. So, our total openings across the year are going to be consistent with what we said in June.\nOperator: We'll now hear from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James.\nBrian Vaccaro: Good morning, and thank you. I just wanted to follow up on the labor environment. And you said staffing levels are less of an issue, and your guest stat metrics are strong. So maybe this is less of an issue for you. But on the -- it seems like retention, training, rebuilding teams and culture seems to be a significant challenge for a lot of companies in and outside of the restaurant industry. So, could you talk a little bit about how you're navigating these challenges, what changes or adjustments you've made? And what are some areas where you still see opportunities to improve on the labor front?\nRick Cardenas: On the labor front or the staffing front. So a couple of things. One, yes, when we hire -- when we have a lot more hires than we normally do, because we were trying to fill our restaurants back up and when our turnover is a little bit higher than it used to be, that leads to higher training. But we've got a great employment proposition. We're continuing to build up our certified trainer ranks. Some of them left the industry when COVID happened. So we're going to -- we're just going to ensure that we do what we did before COVID. We're going to make sure when we hire somebody, they get onboarded like they should at a Darden restaurant that they go through the training, all of the training, and they're not just kind of thrown into the wolves because of short staffing. The fortunate thing is we're not really short staffed. So we have time to spend to train our team members. In our industry, like many service industries, most -- a lot of the turnover happens in the first 90 days. And so when you spend the time on training somebody and they leave within 90 days, there's a lot of cost. So we're focusing our efforts on hiring the right people and training them to our standards, so they don't leave in the first 90 days. And if we can just get that back to close to pre-COVID levels, our retention is going to be back to pre-COVID levels and that will save a lot of money on the P&L.\nBrian Vaccaro: That's helpful color. And, Raj, I think you said hourly wage inflation up around 9.5%, up a little over 9% in this quarter. I guess, with staffing levels recovered, I'm curious to what degree do you expect hourly inflation to moderate over the next few quarters?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Brian. We expect for the full year to be around 8%. So that has implied, there's some moderation as we go through the year. Yeah, you're right, we started with a little bit over 9% in the first quarter. But again, we had -- if you look at last year cadence, you got to look at that there was a step-up in the back half of last year. So as we wrap on that, we don't expect it to be at those levels, yeah.\nBrian Vaccaro: All right. Thank you. And then last one for me, shifting gears just for a second. I guess, I wanted to ask about the path to sustaining higher margins in a post-COVID world and I realize COGS is a big piece, but I ask it in context of Olive Garden store margins that are sort of for the first time running a couple of hundred bps below pre-COVID levels. And, I guess, where do you see ultimately COGS settling out over a multi-quarter or 12-plus months out from here? And maybe if not getting that specific, maybe just walk through or remind us the line item dynamics that you need to play out to achieve higher margins in a post-COVID world? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. Hey, Brian. I'll start and then turn it over to Raj on maybe some line items. But if you think about Olive Garden, Olive Garden had the highest inflation of any brand at Darden this quarter. You had a lot of chicken inflation. Olive Garden sells a lot of chicken. There was inflation in wheat and inflation in cheese. And so that basically is Olive Garden's menu. And so that's why you saw a little bit more of a margin squeeze pressure at Olive Garden, but we have a portfolio that allowed Olive Garden to continue to price the way they've been pricing. And so, we would expect, over the years, our cost of sales to move back towards where it was before. And so we made some investments during COVID to shift some cost -- some spending from marketing to cost of sales. We did that at LongHorn. We did it at Olive Garden. But we would expect our cost of sales to get back to a more reasonable level over the next few years. It's not going to happen in one year. It's going to happen in over a few years as food cost becomes more normal. But if Raj, you want to add any more color on the different margin line items.\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. I would just say, obviously, in the near term, from a margin perspective on the line items, we expect food cost to be higher. We expect, but everything else to be lower than pre-COVID. If you look at, restaurant labor is better than pre-COVID because of the productivity improvements, restaurant expenses are better than pre-COVID. Marketing is better than pre-COVID and then G&A is better than pre-COVID. So these are all the other line items that are actually helping fund some of the -- deal with this higher inflation and helping fund some investments we've made into the plate. But then, as Rick said, over time, we'll continue to evaluate what makes sense and as inflation kind of normalizes or gets deflationary on the commodities front, that gives us more room to kind of balance back over time.\nBrian Vaccaro: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Now we'll hear from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. Rick, at the very beginning of the call, I think it was you, Rick, so I apologize if I'm making this up. There was a mention on technology investments that could potentially influence both the on- and off-premise experience. Could you, I guess, elaborate a little bit more in that? I mean is that more kind of employee-facing work that could potentially drive some efficiencies or are there any customer-facing initiatives that you're seeing, particularly on the off-premise side that you think could increase sales? If you could just elaborate a little bit, what that means, I guess, both over the near and medium term in terms of opportunities that the brands may have on the technology side from this point forward?\nRick Cardenas: Sure, John. I want to start by saying, we've got a great team on the IT team that does a lot of work on the guest experience and the team member and the manager experience. We've been spending a lot of our efforts over the last few years improving the To Go experience because that's where the business was. And we'll continue to make investments in the off-premise experience. We've got some things that are in test now that will help the guest on the off-premise experience. But we've also got some things that we're working for the restaurant managers to make it easier for them to do their job. So, if the manager job is easier, then they can spend more time with our team, our team can be trained better and spend better time with their guests. And so we're going to be spending some time and energy on focusing on things that make their managers' job easier. And we're also still doing some guest-facing things at the restaurant, but not overtly in their face. And so how does somebody get on the wait list a little easier? How does somebody check in to the restaurant a little bit easier? How do they pay for their check a little bit easier? So there are some things that we're still working on across all those dimensions. And the benefit of our scale is we can do that, we can test it in one restaurant and in one brand and move it to the other brands, and it kind of leverages that IT spend across more restaurants.\nJohn Ivankoe: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets.\nChris Carril: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on off-premise. Can you talk about how that roughly 10 point swing in Olive Garden off-premise sales mix versus pre-COVID levels potentially impacts the check or maybe mix specifically versus those pre-COVID levels that we're comparing to? And then as you're thinking about the balance of the year, does your guidance assume that off-premise mix stays steady from here?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Chris. Off-premise mix, I mean, I think pre-COVID we were running close to 15%, 16%, so 8% more than that. That doesn't really change the check that differently. There is a little bit less beverages, but there are other add-ons. So when you look at overall, it's not a big difference. The other thing is catering, is one mix that could -- that has an impact on the check average. But again, it's not huge at this point, but that is something that we have seen some resurgence in. In fact, when you look at over the last two quarters, while our total off-premise mix stayed pretty consistent at Olive Garden at 24%, there's more of catering and a little bit less of individual To Go, but ended up being 24% of total sales, but it was just a different mix. So that's really the only mix change we've noticed on the off-premise, but really no major impact on the check.\nChris Carril: Got it.\nRaj Vennam: And then as we look at guidance, I mean that -- there's really not a lot of -- we don't -- again, I think we kind of expected this to come down a little bit. But given where we've been over the last two quarters, we're not assuming a big change or a big decline in off-premise in guidance. But our belief is that to the extent there is some change there, that's offset with dine-in.\nRick Cardenas: And one last thing. Just so you know, the third quarter is generally a highest off-premise experience, right, because you get a lot of catering, a lot of parties. So, what I would say is after Q2, we might -- it is what it is, but Q3 may be higher than you would expect because of what normally happens in our third quarter in To Go.\nChris Carril: Got it. That's helpful. And then just returning to labor costs, I think you mentioned, you expect wage inflation to be about 8% for the year. But what's your total labor inflation outlook, just inclusive of any kind of productivity measures or any shifts in hours, anything like that?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. The total labor is somewhere in that 6% to 6.5% year-over-year because last year -- we already got all the productivity last year. So, we don't see a year-over-year significant improvement in productivity. In fact, as I was mentioning, first quarter, we were wrapping on elevated productivity from last year. But 6% to 6.5% for total labor is how we're looking at it, that includes the indirect labor as well, the manager salary and all that stuff.\nChris Carril: Got it. Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Now, we'll hear from Nick Setyan with Wedbush Securities.\nNick Setyan: Thank you. It would be really helpful if you could just tell us what the pricing at Olive Garden is and what it's expected to be for the full year versus LongHorn. And then just a clarification. Was the -- month-to-month volatility in the quarter, was it largely driven by Olive Garden or was it very similar across the brands? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Let me start with the latter first. The month-to-month volatility was actually pretty much across all our brands. I think we kind of had -- June was, like I said, mid-3s for the portfolio. That delta between Darden and Olive Garden was pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter -- I mean, month-to-month during the quarter. So there wasn't a huge one segment or one brand that was driving the volatility month-to-month. On the pricing side, I don't want to get specifically to a brand, but I mentioned already that when you look at over three years, Olive Garden's pricing has been 10%. And Darden's pricing is also basically 10%, 10.2%. So it's within Olive Garden being such a big part of our portfolio. What we say about Darden pretty much represents what Olive Garden is going to be.\nNick Setyan: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Kevin for any additional or closing remarks.\nKevin Kalicak: Thanks, Jake. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you, we plan to release second quarter results on Friday, December 16, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you all for participating in today's call.\nOperator: And once again, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Raj Vennam",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone. We had strong absolute results in the first quarter and continue to be pleased with the efforts of our restaurant and support center teams to drive sales, effectively manage spending and navigate a challenging environment. We're lapping record first quarter performance from last year, which was driven by a resurgence in demand, more efficient labor with staffing levels below our standards and many other costs that had yet to be reintroduced into the business as we recovered from the impacts of the pandemic. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.4 billion, 6.1% higher than last year and driven by 4.2% same-restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.56. Total EBITDA was $340 million, and we paid $150 million in dividends and repurchased $199 million in shares, returning a total of $349 million of cash to our shareholders this quarter. In the first quarter, total inflation was roughly 9.5% and total pricing was approximately 6.5%, almost 300 basis points below inflation. We expect total inflation and our gap between pricing and inflation to have peaked in the first quarter. We also expect inflation to moderate throughout the remainder of the year while our pricing gap should narrow in both the first and -- I'm sorry, both the second and third quarter and then reverts in the fourth quarter. And while we have commodities inflation risk in the back half of the year, we have pricing plans ready to put into action, which will help preserve our targeted gap to inflation for the year if we see inflation higher than our expectations. Consistent with what we expected and communicated in the June call, the significant level of pricing below inflation pressured all aspects of our P&L in the first quarter and drove margins well below last year. As we look to the second quarter, we expect margins to decline less than they did in the first quarter and then grow versus last year in the back half. Now looking at the details of the P&L compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 280 basis points higher, driven by commodities inflation of 15%. Restaurant labor was 50 basis points above last year, driven by hourly wage inflation of just over 9% and wrapping on last year's elevated productivity. Total restaurant labor inflation was 7.5%. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points above last year, driven by higher repairs and maintenance expense due to supply chain challenges and utilities inflation of 16%. Marketing spend was 20 basis points higher as we increased testing of both digital and television marketing. G&A expense was 130 basis points below last year, driven primarily by two factors. First, mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation plans was lower by about $7 million and as a reminder, this -- due to the way we hedge this expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line. Second, equity compensation expense related to retirement eligible individuals and our incentive accrual, while both in line with our plan were significantly less than last year. Operating income margin of 10% was 220 basis points below last year, but 60 basis points above pre-COVID levels. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.7%, and we ended the quarter with earnings from continuing operations of $194 million. Now looking at our segments. All of our segments outperformed their respective industry benchmarks on both traffic and sales. And as Rick mentioned, we began seeing a return to normal seasonal sales patterns. This was evident in our monthly same-restaurant sales compared to last year when we did not experience typical seasonal softness. Same-restaurant sales for June were in the mid-3% range. July was in the low 1% range, and they were approximately 8% in August. Sales at Olive Garden were 3.7% above last year, and average weekly sales were 101% of the pre-COVID level despite the significant reduction in promotional activity and couponing versus that time period. As we talked about in the past, we believe the pre-COVID marketing and promotional activities historically drove double-digit traffic. And when we look at our average weekly traffic at Olive Garden, we're retaining over 90% of pre-COVID indicating that traffic trends are flat to above pre-COVID levels when considering historical marketing activities. LongHorn sales were 6.6% above last year, and average weekly sales were 126% of the pre-COVID level. Sales in our Fine Dining segment were 8.6% above last year, and average weekly sales were 120% of the pre-COVID levels. Our other segment sales were 9.9% above last year, and average weekly sales were 109% of the pre-COVID levels. Despite all of our segments having higher sales above last year, the high levels of inflation and wrapping on last year's inflated earnings when many costs had not fully returned to the business, pressured segment profit margin below last year for all the segments. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2023. We reiterated all aspects of our guidance in this morning's press release, culminating in diluted net earnings per share between $7.40 and $8 for the year. Finally, looking at the second quarter, we've seen continued strength in our sales trends with quarter-to-date sales above the high end of our annual same-restaurant sales outlook range. We also expect commodities inflation close to 13%, pressuring the second quarter EPS to be flat to slightly below last year. In what continues to be an unpredictable year, we're confident with the underlying strength of our business model and in our team's ability to effectively manage through it. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. Hi, Jeff. This is Raj. So when we think about our plan and our actual internal expectations and our estimate, we're basically just -- told the board that we're basically back on plan. We're really in line with our internal expectations. As we look specifically at the quarter, was there a little bit of a miss on the sales side? Yes, but not as big as you guys might think. And then overall, profitability was in line and actually slightly ahead. But again, quarter-to-quarter, there is some volatility. As the quarter started or as the year started, we started to see the seasonality return to normal and that was really one of the things that changed how we thought about the business. And if you look at versus pre-COVID, how we trended, the traffic retention was actually pretty similar in Q1 to the way it was in Q4. So there's a lot of noise when you look at year-over-year because of the reopening last year and especially if you think about California that reopened in the middle of June or late June that helped Olive Garden and, to some extent, Yard House, you're wrapping on those levels. So that's why there's a lot of noise year-over-year. But I think the best way to look at it is versus pre-COVID. And when we look at it through that lens, Q1 was actually, like I said, pretty consistent with the performance we had in Q4. Yeah. I think I would, again, go back to the reference to pre-COVID. And if you actually look at it through that lens, you're going to find that August, while year-over-year was higher, it wasn't that big of an increase versus pre-COVID. Is there a movement of a point or two between the month-to-month when you look at it versus pre-COVID? Yes. But in general, we're actually fairly consistent, and I think it's just -- I know it's hard because it's three years ago, but that's really the baseline you got to look at. If you look at it through that lens, our cadence actually looks pretty reasonable. It doesn't look like there's a huge acceleration. Now, there are some specific things related to unique -- in the promotional activity for the brand that when we wrap on that, the pre-COVID retention might be a little different. And that is part of how we look at it, and we take that into consideration as we estimate the business. And that's where you see the retention may be a little bit different month-to-month because of the promotional activity we might be wrapping on versus pre-COVID. But when you exclude that, in general, it's actually been fairly consistent and our estimate essentially assumes that going forward. Yes, Jared. I think, first of all, I want to remind you that the commodities inflation, when we talk about inflation is really a function of what we purchased last year at what price. And for us, I'll take one great example is, we had a great chicken contract. I think we were buying boneless chicken breast in the range of, call it, mid-$1 range and as you all know, I think over two, three months ago, the price of that was as much as $3.50. And I think this week, it's come down to almost $1.80, $1.85, right? So, it's come down a lot. The pricing level, we are definitely seeing the movement in the right direction. But we had expected some of that to happen as we guided. And in fact, directionally, things are moving consistent with what we expected, maybe not as quite as fast as we thought. But it's not that far off. I mean our commodities inflation for the year -- at the beginning of the year, we said we're around 7%. We're probably looking at closer to 7.5%, but that's not a huge change given the volatility we've had in the market. But as we get to the back half, we do wrap on some of these elevated costs. And so, as we look at quarter-to-quarter, we do expect, as we get into Q3, to be more in that mid-single digit range. And as we get to Q4, probably more close to flat to slightly deflationary year-over-year. The other thing is we have -- our coverage, it's really still hard to get coverage too far out. And as you can saw from this morning, I think we showed it in the amount of coverage in our slides here. I think we have 50% coverage over the next six months. And in fact, when you look at the next three months, that's just over 70% but then after that, it's only -- it's closer to 30% coverage. And so, it's still hard to get -- the forward premiums are still high, and we -- especially when things are coming down, we don't want to lock ourselves and not have that optionality. But again, as I said in my comments earlier, if it ends up being a little bit higher, we have headroom in pricing to be able to deal with that. So, I think, much variation -- I want to make sure I understand the question right. When you say much variation from like month-to-month within the quarter, if that's the case, yes, there is some, because of -- again, if you look at -- I have to go back, look at exactly the pre-COVID numbers. But I know that, like I was mentioning earlier, there is the promotional activity that you have to take into consideration as a base. So when we look at pre-COVID, we tease out the impact of promotions and look at that, and that's how I -- we say that's fairly consistent when you look at it, taking out the impact of the promotional activity from then to now. But are we seeing that versus pre-COVID or are we a little bit better September to-date? Yeah, but it's not meaningful -- it's not big enough to really call it a trend change. I don't believe so. I'm trying to think if there is a holiday shift in November, but that's the only thing I can think of. But I don't think there's any change. Yeah. Actually, I think by the time we got to the holiday season last year, obviously Omicron was a factor that started to kick in late into the holidays, and we expect third quarter to be an outperformer on the comp side because of that wrap on that. But outside of that, when we look at our segments, I don't know that there's anything unique that this year holiday wrap that would cause them to be different from where we were before COVID. And I just want to remind you, last year, December was a record sales month for us. It was really -- the Omicron impact was kind of basically the last week of December leading into January. Yeah. I'd say, generally, the pricing flow-through is consistent with what we would expect. I think, Rick mentioned earlier, when you look at the lower income, is there a little bit of erosion on the add-ons? Yes, but it's not meaningful enough for us to say that there's a pushback on pricing, but mind you, we're pricing a lot less than our competitors. And as you think about the fact that the last quarter, our pricing was 6.5% roughly that compares to full-service CPI of 9%. And in fact, and then -- and I'll just point out that when you look at it over a two-year basis, we price 7.5%. And I think, FSR is close to 14% on a two-year. And that just gives you a sense of the fact that we may not be seeing what some others might be seeing, because we haven't taken the levels of pricing that the industry in general has taken. Well, I think we've said in the past, there's not a huge difference in profitability between dining room versus take off-premise. The margin differential is de minimis across the portfolio. Is there some difference from brand to brand? Yes. But when you look at through the portfolio, the levels of profitability is not that different. And as we look at -- if you're looking at what the impact might have if the mix changes, I wouldn't say that changes the margin that much. And again, we -- two quarters in a row, now we are seeing consistent off-premise level. So, we'll have to see how that plays out over time. But I don't expect the margin to change materially based on the change in mix. Yeah, David. Look, we're actually very pleased with the work that Olive Garden team has done in keeping with their strategy. And I'll tell you, as we look at our guest count retention, which is the way we look at it, Q4 Olive Garden guest count retention was in that low-90s, call it 91%, 91-ish and in the first quarter, they were basically in that range. So they're within 0.5 point of what Q4 was. Was there -- I think year-over-year, there are a lot of dynamics, which is why I think there's a little bit of that confusion as well. But when you look at it on a three-year, traffic retention from Q4 to Q1 at Olive Garden was pretty consistent. And then, the other thing I'll point out is Q1 before COVID, what we're comparing to is the quarter where we had buy one, take one for nine weeks of the -- eight or nine weeks of the quarter. And then we also had a big launch of a second promotion that had high TRPs and couponing. And in fact, so when you actually exclude all that, we feel like Olive Garden was actually in a great place. And that's the point we're trying to make is that, I don't think -- we are -- us being close to the business and understanding the details, when we take out those noise -- take that noise out, Olive Garden's performance has been pretty consistent. Yeah, David. I think a couple of things. One, you got to take into consideration the pricing difference between over three years from the first quarter to the second quarter. Then I think when we look at traffic, yeah, I mean it does -- like I was mentioning earlier, there is a little bit of an increase versus pre-COVID. But when we take out the impact from promotions from three years ago, it's not a huge step change. So that's the other part that I think you're missing is like September, three years ago, we did not have the same level of promotional activity at Olive Garden as we did in June and August -- or the first quarter of this year. So that's another factor that plays into how we look at it. Peter, this is -- actually, I don't think it has anything to do with the first quarter trends. But as we look at our plans, I think we're basically within that 10 basis points to 20 basis points, and quarter to quarter, it might vary. But you might see some quarters at 20 basis points, some at 10 basis points, but that's still what we expect to do for the year. Yeah, Brian. I mean, I understand where you're coming from. But I think there's so much uncertainty in this environment for us to basically say that what we saw in the last three weeks or four weeks and then just to be able to say that should be the new number, and that's how we should look at it for the full year. That doesn't make sense. If we look at what happened over the last six months, consistently there's a little bit of movement from week to week. But when you come back and look at it over a larger period of time, call it six or eight weeks, it's pretty consistent. And that's really what we're looking at it through that lens. And I get the point around the promotions, and you don't have visibility to some of that. But even if you just look at the absolute number, I think for Q1 -- Q4, it was, like I said, 91%, 91% to 92%, and Q1 was basically 91% of pre-COVID at Olive Garden, for example. So it's actually pretty consistent from Q4 to Q1 at an absolute quarter level. Month-to-month, week-to-week, there is some volatility, but that's really -- that's where the promotions come into play. Yeah, Jeff. I think for the full year, we're probably still close to that $400 million, which is where I think we were before COVID. So, three years of inflation and other things, growth costs all help offset the corporate restructuring savings of over $25 million or so that we got. So, I would say, at this point, our estimate is closer to that $400 million for the full year. Yeah. I think last year, if you go back, we talked about that impacting sales by about $100 million -- call it, in that $90 million to $100 million range. So that's really the tailwind as you look at it year-over-year on the sales front. Yeah, Eric. Let's say, we always talk about margins at the operating profit level or EBITDA level. The reason we do that is because there's a lot of difference. If we manage G&A better, that give us flexibility to put more costs into the investment into the four walls. So we don't focus as much on the four walls as the full because for us, at the end of the day, it's the total portfolio, right? Where are we for the whole P&L? Where are we from an EBIT margin, where are we from an EBITDA margin. If you look at it through that lens, first quarter was higher than pre-COVID by about, call it, 60 basis points on the profit level and 40 basis points when you look at it through EBITDA, so let me start with that. And then as we look at the full year, do we still expect restaurant-level margins to be better than pre-COVID? Yes, that's what's embedded in our guidance for the full year. The cadence of that is going to be that we have -- if you recall last year, the first and second quarter had the most improvement versus pre-COVID. So that's why you saw a year-over-year decline in the first quarter. We expect that to narrow a little bit in the second quarter, but still decline versus last year, but still ahead of pre-COVID. And then as we get to the back half, we expect to be higher than last year. That's what's embedded in our guidance. And part of that is the shrinking gap between pricing and inflation. And again, this was planful as we went into this year. And so we expect -- at this point, we expect it to play out that way. Yes, David. I think let me start by saying your numbers are right. That's accurate. The -- yes, does that present an opportunity in the dining room? Absolutely. But we're going to go about it in a manner that's actually sustainable and that's where we go back to -- over the last three years, we've invested so much into underpricing inflation. If you look at where Olive Garden's pricing has been over the three years, combined -- full three years combined is at 10%. When you look at where full-service CPI -- restaurant CPI was for the same timeframe, it's 17.5%. So we've actually significantly underpriced the industry and actually, I would argue, significantly underpriced, maybe not to the same extent our competitors. So that is the way we believe to build back that guest. And Rick mentioned getting that one extra visit from our loyal guest, we think this is a sustainable, durable way to really get our guests back, it's going to take time. It's not a one magic, let's drive people in today or tomorrow. It's just going to happen over time. And I would argue that we're starting to see the fruit of some of that, but it takes time. Okay, Sara. That's a lot. So let me start with the pricing gap first, and then I'll get into the margins. So the comment we were making was specifically quarter-to-quarter movement in the year. But what we're targeting for the year is about 100 basis points gap to our inflation. This is not necessarily reflecting the food away from home or that, but I don't anticipate that our gap to the full-service restaurant CPI will shrink. This is more about what's going to happen over the -- by a lot. Maybe is there a 50 basis points movement? Sure. But is it going to shrink a lot? No. What we're talking about is we are targeting for the year, as we said at the beginning of the year, we said approximately 6% inflation -- total inflation and approximately 5% pricing. And we're continuing to -- we're just saying that we'll continue that. But the gap is the largest in the first quarter. It's really a function of year-over-year and the commodities being at those highest levels. So as they come down, the gap to that inflation will narrow and might actually even reverse a little bit in one quarter in the fourth quarter. But the point here is that when you look at it over time, our gap is still pretty wide. And we expect that to remain that wide relative to the full-service CPI and implied also relative to competitors. So that's the thing on the pricing side. As far as margins versus pre-COVID, our guidance implies that our margins will be less than last year; however, they will be still higher than pre-COVID. It still implies, call it, 40 to 50 basis points erosion versus last year for the full year. However, on the -- versus pre-COVID still somewhere close to 150 basis points is what that implies. As far as individual segments, I think the benefit of the portfolio is that our ability to react differently to different situations. And so to the extent, we have -- we don't want to put a specific target by segment, because that really boxes us into a corner. And the way we would think about it is if the consumer on the high end is doing well, maybe we get a little bit more margin from there and invest in the places where we need to. And so, we're thinking long term to get to this portfolio number, but we continue to kind of really evaluate that and play it by the year based on the environment. And so we want to just be more nimble on that front. Yeah, Brian. We expect for the full year to be around 8%. So that has implied, there's some moderation as we go through the year. Yeah, you're right, we started with a little bit over 9% in the first quarter. But again, we had -- if you look at last year cadence, you got to look at that there was a step-up in the back half of last year. So as we wrap on that, we don't expect it to be at those levels, yeah. Yeah. I would just say, obviously, in the near term, from a margin perspective on the line items, we expect food cost to be higher. We expect, but everything else to be lower than pre-COVID. If you look at, restaurant labor is better than pre-COVID because of the productivity improvements, restaurant expenses are better than pre-COVID. Marketing is better than pre-COVID and then G&A is better than pre-COVID. So these are all the other line items that are actually helping fund some of the -- deal with this higher inflation and helping fund some investments we've made into the plate. But then, as Rick said, over time, we'll continue to evaluate what makes sense and as inflation kind of normalizes or gets deflationary on the commodities front, that gives us more room to kind of balance back over time. Yeah, Chris. Off-premise mix, I mean, I think pre-COVID we were running close to 15%, 16%, so 8% more than that. That doesn't really change the check that differently. There is a little bit less beverages, but there are other add-ons. So when you look at overall, it's not a big difference. The other thing is catering, is one mix that could -- that has an impact on the check average. But again, it's not huge at this point, but that is something that we have seen some resurgence in. In fact, when you look at over the last two quarters, while our total off-premise mix stayed pretty consistent at Olive Garden at 24%, there's more of catering and a little bit less of individual To Go, but ended up being 24% of total sales, but it was just a different mix. So that's really the only mix change we've noticed on the off-premise, but really no major impact on the check. And then as we look at guidance, I mean that -- there's really not a lot of -- we don't -- again, I think we kind of expected this to come down a little bit. But given where we've been over the last two quarters, we're not assuming a big change or a big decline in off-premise in guidance. But our belief is that to the extent there is some change there, that's offset with dine-in. Yeah. The total labor is somewhere in that 6% to 6.5% year-over-year because last year -- we already got all the productivity last year. So, we don't see a year-over-year significant improvement in productivity. In fact, as I was mentioning, first quarter, we were wrapping on elevated productivity from last year. But 6% to 6.5% for total labor is how we're looking at it, that includes the indirect labor as well, the manager salary and all that stuff. Let me start with the latter first. The month-to-month volatility was actually pretty much across all our brands. I think we kind of had -- June was, like I said, mid-3s for the portfolio. That delta between Darden and Olive Garden was pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter -- I mean, month-to-month during the quarter. So there wasn't a huge one segment or one brand that was driving the volatility month-to-month. On the pricing side, I don't want to get specifically to a brand, but I mentioned already that when you look at over three years, Olive Garden's pricing has been 10%. And Darden's pricing is also basically 10%, 10.2%. So it's within Olive Garden being such a big part of our portfolio. What we say about Darden pretty much represents what Olive Garden is going to be."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our press release, we had a solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging inflationary and uncertain macroeconomic environment. This was also the first quarter where we began to see the industry return to normal seasonal patterns. I'm proud of the way our restaurant teams are performing. Our brands remain focused on executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere, while at the Darden level, we continue to concentrate on strengthening and leveraging our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and our results-oriented culture. Our people bring our brands to life every day, and our restaurant teams continue to execute at a high level, even with a lot of new team members as our staffing has returned to normal levels. Our team's ability to be brilliant with the basics is driving strong guest satisfaction across our brands. These satisfaction measures at Olive Garden are at or near all-time highs, and steaks grilled correctly scores at LongHorn Steakhouse are the highest in their history. We remain focused on creating great learning environments for new team members to ensure they are fully trained and execute to our standards. Further, our ongoing investments in our team members helps reinforce our strong employment proposition. This focus takes on added significance as we open value creating new restaurants, which further strengthens our scale advantage. During the quarter, we successfully staffed and opened nine new restaurants and we remain on track to open 55 to 60 new restaurants this fiscal year. We also continue to invest in our digital platform and To Go sales benefited from these investments during the quarter. To Go sales accounted for 24% of total sales at Olive Garden, 14% at LongHorn Steakhouse and 13% at Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. Digital transactions accounted for 32% of all off-premise sales during the quarter and 10% of Darden's total sales. Our technology investments have created an infrastructure that reduces friction for our guests and our operators, and we will continue to invest in technology that benefits both off-premise and in-restaurant dining occasions. We are also leveraging our scale to help mitigate the impact of heightened inflation. During the quarter, we continued to experience significant commodities cost pressure, and our supply chain team did an excellent job of working with the suppliers to minimize or offset cost increases to the extent possible. Inflation remains a headwind for consumers as well, particularly those in households making less than $50,000 a year. Olive Garden and Cheddar's have more direct exposure to these guests. Looking at guest behavior across our entire portfolio, we are seeing softness with these consumers, while conversely, we are seeing strength with guests and higher income households. Even in this environment, our brands are made committed to our strategy to price below their competitors. Since we emerged from the height of the pandemic, you have heard us talk about the search for equilibrium or more normal business trends. During the quarter, we saw a return to historical seasonal patterns which we did not experience last year. As we have discussed in recent calls, finding that equilibrium will inform our brand's marketing strategies. As we execute our plans, we will be very selective in bringing any promotional activity back. And any promotional activity we introduced should be evaluated with the following filters. First, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations, which allows our teams to consistently deliver exceptional guest experiences. And finally, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests, but doing that in a way that drives profitable sales growth. As an example, Olive Garden's unique competitive advantage is never ending abundant craveable Italian food. That is why the television advertising progressed from spots that feature their never ending first course to those that are now focused on they're made from scratch sauces and anything they do going forward should continue to elevate this core brand equity. I am pleased with the progress our teams made executing against their strategic priorities during the quarter. Our strategy is working, enabling us to grow sales, increase market share and invest in our people and our brands all while continuing to earn -- to return capital to our shareholders. Last month, we held our annual leadership conferences, which provide a powerful way for us to engage with every general manager and managing partner across all 1,875 restaurants. These restaurant leaders hold the most influential role in our company and the opportunity to interact with them and listen to those closest to the action is invaluable. Our leaders return to their restaurants aligned to their brands operational priorities and motivated to continue winning. In order to win, we must stay focused on executing our Back-to-Basics operating philosophy and leveraging our four competitive advantages as we continue working in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. Our guests, our team members and the communities where we operate. One of the ways, we serve our communities is by fighting hunger. Once again this year, Darden is helping Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for 10 member food banks to support mobile pantry programs and food distribution in communities with the highest need. With the addition of these new trucks, 25 different food banks have received a truck since January of last year. Of course, our philanthropic giving would not be possible without the passion our restaurant teams have for nourishing and delighting our guests. On behalf of our leadership team and our Board of Directors, I want to thank our 180,000 team members for everything you do to serve our guests and communities. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Hey, Brian. Thanks for the question. The consumer at the below $50,000 is feeling a little bit worse than maybe before, but gas prices are helping. So if you think about that consumer at $50,000 a year and below, gas prices make up a big portion of their income. And actually, that consumer spends more money on gas per person than any other income group above them. So as gas prices came down, they started feeling a little bit better, but we'll see what happens with gas prices going forward. And if I can clarify one other thing that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I said that To Go sales were 32% -- I'm sorry, digital sales were 32% To Go of off-premise. They were actually 62%. So sorry about that. Yeah. I'm not going to get into detail on if we're bringing it back. As I did say in the prepared remarks, if and when they introduce promotional activity, it should elevate brand equity in which we've been doing for the last year or so at Olive Garden, it should be simple to execute and not be at a deep discount. Our goal with anything we do promotional activity or anything else we do to drive sales is profitable sales growth and we have ways to measure ROI. The things that we learned through COVID and even -- and we knew before when LongHorn started to reduce their kind of limited time offer price point, deep discounted promotions is there was a lot of work involved in getting items that we don't usually have in the restaurant, getting that through the supply chain, training it. And so there were a lot of costs there. And so as we think about future potential kind of communication methods and the way we talk about our products and promote, as I said, is going to be things that don't make it more complicated, much more complicated in the restaurant, but it has to focus on our brand equities and not be a deep discount. Yeah. We aren't seeing a lot of significant promotional activity. Other than a couple out there, there's one brand out there doing an all you can eat promotion that they did before COVID at the same price point. There's another brand out there doing an all you can eat promotion at a much significantly higher price point than pre-COVID. But I think you mentioned it, margins are challenged in a lot of these competitors. And so the ability for them to do significant discounted promotions to drive traffic may not be something that they do. Now, if food costs come way down, they might start talking about promotions and price points. But the margins that you see out there versus pre-COVID might make it a little bit harder for them to do some significant deep discounting. Yeah. I think a couple of things. One is, let's not read into it that we're seeing a huge, huge reduction in that consumer. We're seeing a little bit of change in the behavior from that consumer, but not huge. And so we don't want to change what we do just to capture a segment of the population. We want to continue to focus on what we've been doing, especially at Olive Garden is to earn one more visit from our loyal guests. And our loyal guests span a lot of income levels. And so anything we do is going to help drive more loyalty from our existing guests, whether they are at below $50,000 or above $50,000. Remember, we said that $50,000 income consumers make up a portion of Olive Garden, but it's not a majority. And so, a majority of our consumers still are above that, and that consumer, especially above $100,000 is doing very well. Hey. Thanks, Peter. All right. We're getting a lot of questions on traffic at Olive Garden. I just want to reiterate, we're really proud of the work Olive Garden has done and Dan has done and the team over the last couple of years. What they've done to simplify their operation, to improve margins over time, over pre-COVID has been great. They outperformed the industry this year, this quarter in both sales and traffic. And as I shared in our prepared remarks, within our portfolio, they have more consumers at below $50,000. That doesn't mean that we're worried about the below $50,000 consumer because it hasn't been a significant move in traffic from that. Yes, we've seen some check management a little bit. And as we've said, it's not significant. So, our media is a lot lower. There's a lot of reasons for the performance at Olive Garden and the performance at Cheddar's. But we haven't seen much check management, maybe a little bit at Cheddar's. Yeah, Brian. So Olive Garden did not have a different seasonal pattern than the other brands, so the seasonality pattern was very consistent with Olive Garden with LongHorn and Cheddar's. The difference in kind of the two -- the three year difference or pre-COVID difference, as was something that Raj said. In the summer of 2019, we had buy one, take one in the first quarter at Olive Garden. It was the first time we did it in the first quarter. So it was about, I think, a 2 point swing that we had from Q4 to Q1. But the seasonality was very consistent across when you compare. As the $50,000 income, Cheddar's and Olive Garden are fairly consistent. They're a little bit higher than they are at LongHorn. But it's not anywhere near the majority. And so we're not going to give you an exact number, but it is higher than LongHorn, but it's not significantly higher. Sure. Yeah. Well, when we talk about return to seasonality, it's based on the consumer backdrop there is today, it's not necessary -- if something changes dramatically, you might see some different seasonal patterns. But my guess is you'll still see the same flows month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. It just might be a little bit lower, a little bit higher depending on where the consumer is. The only difference that we'll see -- and that's versus pre-COVID. When you think about versus last year, we are going to have the Omicron wrap that we have in January basically and a little bit of February. So that should help versus last year on a Q3 basis. But as we talk about seasonality, it's really more about the consumer returning more to normal based on COVID, not on the economy, because we're basically assuming that the economy stays somewhere around where we are. If it gets a little worse, that might impact inflation in a positive way for us. And as we said in the call in the first quarter, if food costs go down 1%, it's better -- it offsets a 2% decline in guest count. I'm sorry, if total inflation goes down 1%, it impacts -- it's the same impact as a 2% change in guest count. I would say on three-year trends in sales, we would be positive even more than that because we were positive to three years ago in sales right now. On the traffic side, what we've said in the past is the marketing activity and the spending that we've done in marketing is probably around a 10% impact to traffic. And Raj mentioned that in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter, we were in the low-90s to traffic to pre-COVID, and that's mostly driven by all of the media that we did before and the coupons and all the other things. But it was something that we wanted to do, and we expected to see some traffic miss from that. And so total sales would be higher and guest count would be higher if we were in the same kind of marketing mix we were before. Yeah. I think a couple of things. The off-premise experience is a lot better across a lot of places. So, people have other ways to get their food from casual dining than they did before. And so that could lead to a little bit less dining room traffic, especially as there are still some consumers that don't want to go out to eat. While a lot of people think COVID is over, there are some that don't. And so even with restaurant closures, a lot of the closures happen in independents in urban markets. And so some of the suburban markets are still doing well and they didn't have as many closures. So -- but what Raj was mentioning earlier, with margins being basically the same for us on off-premise versus on-premise, because we don't have that delivery charge, then we're okay wherever it is. We want our dining rooms to be more full, and you're starting to see them fill up. Not all the brands are back to pre-COVID levels. LongHorn is above pre-COVID levels in traffic. And so we feel good about all of our brands and what they're going to do. The good news is if our dining rooms aren't back to full, we've got capacity. And as we continue to see some improvement, as we continue to do the things that we have been doing over the last few years, focusing on simplification, making it easier for our teams to do what they do, investing in our food, investing in our teams, then we're going to have an even better experience as guests come back, and they are coming back. So, that just gives us more opportunity to grow in the long run because our dining rooms in some of our brands aren't back to pre-COVID levels. That's being offset in most of our brands by To Go. Yeah, Jon. We're not going to discuss our plans for competitive reasons. But as we've said a few times today, anything that we do should emphasize our brand equity and be more profitable than they were before. Yeah, Jon. I think there's a few ways to kind of tease that out. One is look at our Fine Dining business and how well they're doing and the sales that they've had. Even though in the first quarter, the urban markets hadn't reopened yet really much and a lot of people hadn't gone back to work. We had a significant difference in Fine Dining in the suburban markets versus the urban markets. That's tightening now with people going back to work. But Fine Dining is doing really well. Many of our other brands in the other segment, you've got Yard House, you've got Seasons 52 doing very well because of that consumer. And at Olive Garden, our mix has changed and so our consumer is a little bit higher. And so think about LongHorn. LongHorn caters to a little bit higher consumer and their sales are still strong, and traffic is still strong versus pre-COVID. So there's a lot of ways to see it. And we're seeing the ability as we take price in some of the Fine Dining brands, there's really no pushback. So we think that that is a broad-based benefit for us because we have a portfolio of brands that kind of run the spectrum of the consumer. And so when one segment of the population isn't doing as well, the other segment is, then we are still okay. And then if it flips the other way, we're okay. And so right now, there's just one segment of the population that's being hurt a little bit more by inflation than others. And the good news is we've got brands that aren't impacted by that. Yeah. If we're going to in a scenario that food costs deflate even more or reduce even more than we have in our estimate already, because remember, what I've said in the June call and even today is we continue to expect food cost to go down, the inflation to go down from where it was in the first quarter. And I'm assuming that our competitors are assuming the same thing. That said, we don't anticipate changing our messaging to be a pure value play. We think we have value on all of our brands every day based on the investments that we've made in our food, the improvement that we have in our service, and our brands are going to talk about whichever ones do any kind of communication, they're equities. And at Olive Garden, it's never ending craveable abundant Italian food. At LongHorn, its quality and they talk about quality. It doesn't have -- they don't have to talk about price. And at our other brands, we talk about -- at Cheddar's, it is about (ph) value. So if Cheddar's talks more in digitally, it will be about value because that's their equity. So we're not going to change our marketing based on what's happening with food cost. We're going to market based on our strategy. Yeah. We continue to get a significant increase in applicant flow across the country. We have a new talent management system. We've had it for over a year. And that system allows applicants to automatically schedule their interviews, et cetera., and we've got so many interviews scheduled. We're going to have to figure out how to maybe slow that down because managers, all they're doing is interviewing in a lot of places. So we've got a really good applicant flow. As we said, we opened quite a few restaurants this quarter. All of them were fully staffed with great people ready to go. Our turnover, our manager retention is much closer to pre-COVID levels. It's pretty close to pre-COVID levels and well better than the industry average, our manager retention. And our team member retention is also well above the industry, but it's not quite back to pre-COVID levels. So our teams are focused. And as we mentioned, we had our general manager/managing partner conferences last month. And most of those conferences we're talking about ensuring that we train our new team members and improve retention. We think that's a key for us going forward, and we'll continue to focus on trying to get our retention levels back to pre-COVID levels. And I just want to add one thing, David, which is what you said. Some of those guests that we were doing in these dining rooms might not have been as profitable as we'd like, right? We had a lot of coupons. There were times when we had five coupons in one week at Olive Garden, when we were running never any possible, right? And so we had to ask ourselves, is that the right thing to do to drive traffic, just to have a full restaurant if that traffic really isn't very profitable. We do a lot of work when they're there. And so are we better off with a loyal guest that doesn't need all of those discounts to come in, and we can serve them. They know what they're going to get. They get a consistent experience. So everything Raj said, I agree with, but our strategy is to -- we've significantly reduced discounting. It's such a small part of the number of checks, very, very minimal, and we'd like to keep it that way. Yeah, David. We specifically mentioned Olive Garden being at or near record highs, and we talked about LongHorn having their stakes grow correctly at record, but I would tell you that Cheddar's is at a record high for us in the time that we've owned them. They've got the highest satisfaction. They've got the lowest dissatisfaction they've ever had. We've got the same thing at Olive Garden, high satisfaction at LongHorn. I believe they're at their highest overall ratings or if not at the highest, are as close as they've been because cooking the steak right is a big part of satisfaction. At our other brands, at Seasons 52, satisfaction is really high. So we haven't really seen -- we've actually bucked the trend on consumer satisfaction, not just in the category. If you look at consumer satisfaction or customer satisfaction over the last few years, it's been on a decline. Ours is not. And we think it's because of what we've done over the last few years and even the last five or 10 years to continue to improve our guest experience to continue to add more value on the plate and to be consistent. We've got a core group of team members that work in every one of our restaurants that have been there a long time. Our restaurants are fully staffed in general. We've got pockets of restaurants that are understaffed, but those are the same kind of pockets that we had before COVID. And so we believe that the things that we've done over the last few years have helped improve guest satisfaction because we've got great loyalty members. So is that part of the reason that we aren't -- we don't have to do as much versus others on the marketing front? Perhaps. But what I would say, it gives us even more confidence that if we do turn on some media that we're going to execute really well and delight even more people. Yeah. I would say that this year, our marketing is going to be 10 basis points to 20 basis points above last year. What are specific markers we're looking at to significantly increase marketing? There's quite a few. One is we're going to continue to -- we're testing right now in some digital marketing and other media to see which one drives the best ROI. And when we feel like it's time to turn that on, we will. We're going to make sure that our turnover is back to a more reasonable level. Our guest experience is still great. But there's no one individual marker that we're going to say this -- when this happens, we're going to turn on media. We just don't want to let our competitors know what the markers are. Yeah. A couple of things. One, we had one of our restaurants catch fire and it had to close temporarily. But yeah -- and we have -- yeah, we moved Capital Burger into the other segment versus Fine Dining before, and there's three Capital Burgers in there. But we opened a restaurant in Fine Dining, but we only had one total closure. So, our total openings across the year are going to be consistent with what we said in June. On the labor front or the staffing front. So a couple of things. One, yes, when we hire -- when we have a lot more hires than we normally do, because we were trying to fill our restaurants back up and when our turnover is a little bit higher than it used to be, that leads to higher training. But we've got a great employment proposition. We're continuing to build up our certified trainer ranks. Some of them left the industry when COVID happened. So we're going to -- we're just going to ensure that we do what we did before COVID. We're going to make sure when we hire somebody, they get onboarded like they should at a Darden restaurant that they go through the training, all of the training, and they're not just kind of thrown into the wolves because of short staffing. The fortunate thing is we're not really short staffed. So we have time to spend to train our team members. In our industry, like many service industries, most -- a lot of the turnover happens in the first 90 days. And so when you spend the time on training somebody and they leave within 90 days, there's a lot of cost. So we're focusing our efforts on hiring the right people and training them to our standards, so they don't leave in the first 90 days. And if we can just get that back to close to pre-COVID levels, our retention is going to be back to pre-COVID levels and that will save a lot of money on the P&L. Yeah. Hey, Brian. I'll start and then turn it over to Raj on maybe some line items. But if you think about Olive Garden, Olive Garden had the highest inflation of any brand at Darden this quarter. You had a lot of chicken inflation. Olive Garden sells a lot of chicken. There was inflation in wheat and inflation in cheese. And so that basically is Olive Garden's menu. And so that's why you saw a little bit more of a margin squeeze pressure at Olive Garden, but we have a portfolio that allowed Olive Garden to continue to price the way they've been pricing. And so, we would expect, over the years, our cost of sales to move back towards where it was before. And so we made some investments during COVID to shift some cost -- some spending from marketing to cost of sales. We did that at LongHorn. We did it at Olive Garden. But we would expect our cost of sales to get back to a more reasonable level over the next few years. It's not going to happen in one year. It's going to happen in over a few years as food cost becomes more normal. But if Raj, you want to add any more color on the different margin line items. Sure, John. I want to start by saying, we've got a great team on the IT team that does a lot of work on the guest experience and the team member and the manager experience. We've been spending a lot of our efforts over the last few years improving the To Go experience because that's where the business was. And we'll continue to make investments in the off-premise experience. We've got some things that are in test now that will help the guest on the off-premise experience. But we've also got some things that we're working for the restaurant managers to make it easier for them to do their job. So, if the manager job is easier, then they can spend more time with our team, our team can be trained better and spend better time with their guests. And so we're going to be spending some time and energy on focusing on things that make their managers' job easier. And we're also still doing some guest-facing things at the restaurant, but not overtly in their face. And so how does somebody get on the wait list a little easier? How does somebody check in to the restaurant a little bit easier? How do they pay for their check a little bit easier? So there are some things that we're still working on across all those dimensions. And the benefit of our scale is we can do that, we can test it in one restaurant and in one brand and move it to the other brands, and it kind of leverages that IT spend across more restaurants. And one last thing. Just so you know, the third quarter is generally a highest off-premise experience, right, because you get a lot of catering, a lot of parties. So, what I would say is after Q2, we might -- it is what it is, but Q3 may be higher than you would expect because of what normally happens in our third quarter in To Go."

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Courtney Aquilla. Thank you. You may begin.\nCourtney Aquilla: Thank you, Darrell. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden\u2019s President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the investor relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation include non-GAAP measurements and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2025 first quarter earnings on Thursday, September 19th before the market opens followed by a conference call. During today's call any reference to pre-COVID when discussing fourth quarter performance is a comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and any reference to annual pre-COVID performance is the trailing 12-months ending February of fiscal year 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence's casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden's casual dining brands. During our fiscal fourth quarter, industry same restaurant sales decreased 0.8% and industry same restaurant guest counts decreased 3.5%. And during our full fiscal year 2024, industry same restaurant sales decreased 1.4% and industry same restaurant guest counts decreased 4.7%. This morning Rick will share some brief remarks recapping the fiscal year. Raj will provide details on the fourth quarter and full-year financial results and share our fiscal 2025 financial outlook. And then Rick will close with some final comments. Now I will turn it over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Courtney. Before I begin, I would like to thank Kevin Kalicak for his leadership of Investor Relations for close to 10-years. As many of you know, Kevin has moved to Lead Finance for Olive Garden. We are excited for his new opportunity and equally excited to have Courtney transition into leading investor relations. I'm confident you will find Courtney a worthy successor. Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our ability to stay disciplined and control what we can control. This continued focus enabled us to have a strong year in what became an increasingly weaker consumer environment, especially for consumers below the median household income. For the full-year, we grew total sales by 8.6% to $11.4 billion, delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $8.88, an increase of 11%, exceeding the high-end of the EPS range we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year, despite the challenging sales environment that emerged in the back half of the year. We opened 53 new restaurants in 24 states, eight of which were reopenings, and acquired and completed the integration of Ruth's Chris Steak House. Throughout the year, we strengthened and defended our four competitive advantages, and our restaurants remained focused on being brilliant with the basics. This has enabled us to successfully navigate whatever comes our way, including the increased discounting and marketing pressure we've seen recently. And when evaluating our performance within the context of our long-term framework of 10% to 15% total shareholder return as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield, we delivered a TSR of 14.2% for fiscal 2024, which is near the high-end of our target. And as I said, our teams are focused on controlling what they can control. One of the ways we do that is by having well-trained, tenured team members. Our manager and team member retention is at or above pre-COVID levels, and our teams are benefiting from this staffing consistency, which helps create great guest experiences. We also provide our teams with training programs that not only enhance their skill sets, but build on the unique culture of our brands. Further strengthening engagement. For example, LongHorn recently completed their seventh steak master series. Over the course of two months, 1,000s of culinary team members competed in this highly engaging grilling competition and training program for the Right to be Crown Champion and received the $15,000 grand prize. Congratulations to this year's champion, Jacob Montgomery from the LongHorn Steak House in Cape Coral, Florida. Beyond providing strong labor and cost management, our operators are ensuring their teams remain focused on being brilliant with the basics, which is driving record guest satisfaction. Several of our brands reach all new time highs for overall guest satisfaction for the full fiscal year, including Olive Garden, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Season\u2019s 52, and Bahama Breeze. Additionally, within the casual dining segment of technomics industry tracking tool, LongHorn ended the fiscal year ranked number one for food, service, atmosphere, and overall perceptions, as well as brand fit and loyalty. Now let me provide a final update on the integration of Ruth's Chris Steak House. During the quarter, we completed the transition of all company-owned restaurants onto both our proprietary point of sale and labor management systems, which were the final major changes for the restaurants. We also acquired a single franchise location in Destin, Florida during the quarter. Thanks to the hard work and collaboration between the Ruth's Chris team and our integration team, we closed on the acquisition and completed the integration during the same fiscal year. This included onboarding 5,000 new team members with no turnover among our nine directors of operations. We also achieved the expected synergies, resulting in EPS accretion of $0.10. Integration is not easy, and I'm particularly proud of the focus the restaurant teams maintained on the guest and team member experience throughout the process. Overall I'm pleased with our performance for the fiscal year. We successfully navigated a challenging environment and our proven strategy combined with the strength of our business ensures we are well positioned regardless of the operating environment. As we begin fiscal 2025, we remain focused on managing our business for the long-term by executing our strategy that drives growth and long-term shareholder value. We have also taken steps to further position Darden and our brands for future growth and success through several leadership changes. We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talent and these changes are designed to allow two of our most seasoned presidents to devote more time to developing our newest brand presidents. After nine years of leading LongHorn Steak House to record performance, Todd Burrowes has transitioned to a new role as President of Business Development. Todd now has responsibility for our new restaurant development and facilities team, our international and franchising business, and Ruth's Chris, our newest brand. Reporting to Todd are Mark Braun, Senior Vice President of Development; Brad Smith, President of International and Franchising; and Rick Jenkins, President of Ruth's Chris, who previously led operations for the brand. Todd is well suited to lead this work. He brings an operator's perspective to new restaurant development and our growing franchise business. Further, Todd was with LongHorn when we acquired Ruth's Hospitality 17-years ago, and he will be a valuable leader and resource for Rick as the Ruth\u2019s Chris team continues to acclimate to Darden. Todd's replacement at LongHorn is Laura Williamson. Laura is well respected across LongHorn, having served as their finance leader for nine years. She will report to me. We also named three new brand Presidents within our specialty restaurant group, who will report directly to John Martin, who continues to serve as President of the Specialty Restaurant Group. Bryan Clements, the Former Head of Operations at Olive Garden, is now President of Yard House. Falon Farrell, who led operations for Eddie V\u2019s, has been named President of the Capital Grill in Eddie V's. And Mark Cooper, who led finance for the Special Restaurant Group, is now President of Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze. I'm excited about these changes and confident we have the right leaders in place to drive future growth. I'm also proud that three of our seven brand presidents began their careers as hourly team members at our restaurants and the average tenure of all of our brand presidents is 27 years. Now I'll turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick. And good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2024 was another strong year for Darden, and I am proud of the results our teams achieved. Despite sales results that were weaker than we anticipated, earnings exceeded our initial expectations for the year. Strong cost management by our teams and easing commodities and labor inflation drove this earnings outperformance. Now looking at the fourth quarter, we generated $3 billion of total sales, 6.8% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 80 company-owned Ruth's Chris Steak House restaurants and 37 net new restaurants from our legacy brands. Our same restaurant sales were flat for the quarter, outpacing the industry by 80 basis points and same restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 130 basis points. Throughout the quarter our casual dining brands maintained their relative share of guest visits. Olive Garden guest count growth was near the top quartile of the industry and Long Horn Stake House was at the top decile of the industry. This is impressive when you consider the increased levels of discounting and promotional activity by some competitors within casual dining. Our same restaurant guest count or performance to the industry exceeded our same restaurant sales out performance due to our lower levels of pricing relative to the industry this quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2.7% to $2.65. We generated $523 million in adjusted EBITDA and returned $254 million to shareholders through $156 million in dividends and $97 million of share repurchases. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L, compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 20 basis points better as commodities inflation was better-than-expected at approximately 2%. Seafood deflation this quarter helped partially offset mid-single-digit beef and produce inflation. Restaurant labor was 10 basis points better, driven by productivity improvements and favorability and other benefits, which more than offset the impact of pricing below labor inflation, which was approximately 4%. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points better than last year driven by strong cost management and lower pre-opening expenses. Marketing expense was 1.3% of sales, consistent with our expectations and 20 basis points higher than last year. This all resulted in restaurant-level EBITDA improving 20 basis points to 20.9%. Adjusted G&A expenses were 40 basis points lower and the total expense was slightly favorable to our previous guidance. This was driven by ongoing synergies from the integration of Ruth's Chris and favorable mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. Due to the way we hedge mark-to-market expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line. Interest expense increased 40 basis points due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth\u2019s Chris acquisition. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.4%, 40 basis points higher, driven by the mark-to-market hedge impact I referenced earlier. And we generated $318 million in adjusted earnings from continuing operations, which was 10.8% of sales. Looking at our segments for the quarter, Olive Garden increased total sales 0.7%, driven by new restaurant growth partially offset by negative same restaurant sales of 1.5%. While Olive Garden same restaurant sales were below the industry, same restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmark by 60 basis points. This dynamic was due to our decision to minimize pricing. For the quarter, Olive Garden pricing was approximately 1%. Olive Garden segment profit margin of 22.8% continues to be industry leading. At LongHorn, total sales increased 7.2%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 4% and new restaurant growth. LongHorn same restaurant sales outperformed the industry by 480 basis points. Segment profit margin of 19.1% was 50 basis points above last year. Strong cost management, including improved labor productivity drove LongHorn's margin growth this quarter as pricing was below inflation. Total sales at the fine dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth\u2019s Chris company-owned restaurants. And despite negative same restaurant sales at Capital Grille and Eddie V's, the fine dining segment's profit margin expanded in the fourth quarter, driven by improvement in our cost base. The other business segment sales increased with the addition of Ruth\u2019s Chris franchise and managed location revenue. This was partially offset by combined negative same restaurant sales of 1.1% for the brands in the other segment. Segment profit margin of 17.4% was 160 basis points better than last year, driven by the sales leverage from the additional royalty revenue. As we look at our annual results for fiscal 2024, we had same restaurant sales growth of 1.6%, outperforming the industry in same restaurant sales and traffic by about 300 basis points. And this is on top of 500 basis points of outperformance in traffic last year. We delivered $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. This is an increase of over 50%, compared to five years ago. Additionally, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders with $628 million in dividends and $454 million in share repurchases. Looking at our fiscal 2024 full-year P&L, we had restaurant-level EBITDA growth of 120 basis points driven by strong cost management by our teams and pricing leverage. This favorability was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense and the impairment expense related to eight permanent closures that occurred during the year. This resulted in operating income margin that was 50 basis points higher than last year. Additional financing expenses primarily related to the Ruth\u2019s Chris acquisition drove adjusted interest expense 40 basis points higher than last year. This all resulted in adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 9.4% flat to last year. Looking at our performance since 2019 relative to our long-term framework, we generated annualized EAT growth of 8% and cash returns of 3.7%, culminating in total shareholder returns of 11.7% as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield. This is well within our targeted range despite the issuance of 9 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2020 and other business disruptions from COVID. A strong operating model generates significant and durable cash flows. Since 2019, we have delivered 9% annualized adjusted EBITDA growth. Our balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2024 is well positioned with adjusted debt to EBITDAR at 1.9 times. This is below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, even with the additional debt related to Ruth's Chris acquisition. Now turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2025, we expect total sales of $11.8 billion to $11.9 billion, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 45 to 50 gross new restaurants. Capital spending of $550 million to $600 million, total inflation of approximately 3%, which includes commodities inflation of approximately 2% and labor inflation of approximately 4%. An annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 119 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. All of this results in diluted net earnings per share between $9.40 and $9.60. Finally, our board approved a 7% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share, implying an annual dividend of $5.60. And with that, I'll turn it back to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thanks, Raj. All of us at Darden continue to work together in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve, our guests, team members, and communities. During the year, we had the privilege of serving 420 million guests, more than 1 million per day, providing great food and drinks with attentive service in an engaging atmosphere. We also promoted 1,100 hourly team members into our manager and training program and promoted nearly 300 managers to general manager or managing partner positions. And we continue to invest in our team members with programs like Fast Fluency, which provides the opportunity to learn English for free, and our next course scholarship program that, through the Darden Foundation, has awarded 200 scholarships worth $3,000 each over the past two years to children of our team members. We also remain committed to nourishing and delighting the communities we serve through our ongoing efforts to fight hunger. As part of our Harvest Food Donation Program, our restaurants donated 4.5 million meals to local food banks in fiscal 2024. We also continued our successful partnership with Feeding America with another $2 million donation from the Darden Foundation that helped provide mobile food trucks to 10 more Feeding America food banks, bringing the total to 45 trucks provided over the last four years. To wrap up, I want to thank our team members in our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout the year. Their disciplined approach in executing our strategy is what enables us to succeed, regardless of the operating environment. Now I will take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Harbour: Yes, thank you. Good morning, guys. Maybe first just on your sales outlook for the year. Could you comment on how you see kind of the different brands feeding into that? And you obviously have very different kind of comparisons as we think about the start of the year versus the end of the year. Presumably there's kind of some pickup in Olive Garden. How do you think about the drivers of that?\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Brian, this is Raj. Good morning. So let's just start with the guidance at a high level from a sales outlook, right? Before we get into the brand level. So when we take a look at the upcoming year, we look at the information that's out there and where the macro is expected to be. And as you all know, most economists are expecting weakening GDP growth. So that's taken into consideration. Then we're also taking into consideration what we're cycling through, right? We started to see a little bit more weakness in the back half of this fiscal year, so we're taking that into consideration as we look at next year. So when we look at how we built this estimate and guidance, we are -- we expect underlying traffic trends to gradually improve throughout the year. And so that's really how we built it. I don't want to get into the exact details on the brands, but at a blended level, we're thinking 1% to 2% same restaurant sales growth for the full-year. And as I said, gradual improvement through the year on the underlying trends. And then there's just one callout is Thanksgiving shifts out of Q2 into Q3. So Q2 print might look better than the underlying trends, and Q3 will be the opposite. So that's typically about somewhere around 80 to 100 basis points impact on sales in the quarter. Positive for Q2, negative for Q3. And so all that said, in this current environment, there's more variability around our sales guide, but we have higher levels of confidence in our earnings outlook. And so, that's kind of where we are.\nBrian Harbour: Okay. Thank you. And maybe could you just comment on your pricing thoughts at this point within that? Is there anything we should keep in mind with respect to timing? Is there perhaps some that you would delay in an effort to keep it more modest at the start of the year?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Brian, the good news on pricing is we've actually kept pricing very modest over the last five years, right? So we do expect pricing for this year to be more in line with inflation, so in that 2.5% to 3% range probably. But as we think about how that's going to be spread, we expect it to be more consistent quarter-to-quarter. Now, there may be a 10, 20 basis points movement between quarters. But if you look at over the last five years, we've only priced a lot and that gives us some flexibility and we've talked about that before. So we've underpriced about 20% over the last five years, compared to where the overall CPI is, which I think was close to 23% on the same five-year basis and then full services at 28%. And underpriced grocery as well. So we feel like we've done a lot of work on keeping prices low and we're going to continue to do that. And as you saw that in the fourth quarter too. We talked about Olive Garden closer to 1% pricing in the fourth quarter.\nBrian Harbour: Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nLauren Silberman: Great. Thank you. Just first on your approach to marketing. So Olive Garden comp's have been weak over the past couple of quarters. Some share losses quarter understand on a traffic basis. You outperformed. But as you think about your approach to marketing and promos, how does that influence your decision to increase marketing and what are you expecting for fiscal \u201825?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Lauren. In regards to marketing, we've said in the past that we'd probably tick it up a couple of tenths a year and that's probably what we'll do in fiscal \u201825. But we're going to continue to focus in our marketing efforts on our filters, which we've talked about many times. And we're not going to do things to buy sales, even with the increasing discounting our competitors are doing. You know, our best way to drive sales is our focus on a back to basics operating philosophy and our guests telling others what a great value they have when they come to our restaurants. And just remember, we do have levers to pull. We do have more marketing to pull if we want to, but our focus is on profitable sales growth.\nLauren Silberman: Great. Thank you for that. And just a follow-up on the consumer environment. Is this mostly related to the low-income consumer? Just what are you seeing across the middle income, high income, across the breadth of your brands? Thanks so much.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Lauren. It is mostly at the income -- at the consumer below the median household income, which is about $75,000. Consumers are generally concerned about inflation, and they're becoming more concerned about the job market. And what we're seeing are some behavior shifts that we had already started to see. So for Q4, transactions from households below -- with incomes below the median were lower than last year. So -- and that's more pronounced with consumers below $50,000 in income. And these impacts were even greater in our fine dining brands. So that's why you saw fine dining had a little bit more negative comp than others. But at the same time, our guests aren't managing their check like we've seen in prior quarters. And so, you know, we continue to tell you what this means for our brands. Operators that deliver their brand promise and value will continue to appeal to consumers despite economic challenges, and that's what we're focused on doing. We're focusing on giving the consumers that are coming to our restaurants and spending their hard-earned money a great value and a great experience and have them tell others to come back.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nEric Gonzalez: Hi. Thanks for the question. I think I just heard you say that your guests aren't managing the check the way you've seen in prior quarters. Can you make a comment on why you think that's the case?\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Eric. So yes, we did. So if you think back to what we said earlier in the fiscal year, we were seeing a big negative mix on the check and we talked about that, especially both at casual brands and fine dining. And last quarter we said we started to see some moderation. And as we look at this year, this quarter, if we look at Olive Garden and LongHorn, basically the mix was flat. So basically there was no negative mix at all, which is a significant improvement. And then when you look at fine dining, you know, we saw some moderation in Q3 and that continues to moderate into Q4. I think we're now down into the 80, 90 basis points range in the negative mix versus the 200 or so that we were seeing a couple quarters ago. So we're just starting to see the ones that come to us are not managing the check as much as they used to.\nEric Gonzalez: Okay. And then just maybe on the guidance, you know, there was a fairly wide gap in comp performance between Olive Garden and LongHorn this quarter. You know, you have that 1% to 2% guidance for next year. If you're not willing to break it out by brand in terms of guidance, but maybe you can comment on whether you'd expect that performance gap to widen or stays as wide as it is, or do you think it's going to converge in FY \u201820 cuts?\nRaj Vennam: Eric, the way we are looking at it is most brands are going to be within the range we provide it. We are providing a 1% to 2%. I'm not going to get into the comments about the range between Olive Garden and LongHorn specifically, but when we look at 1% to 2%, we expect most brands to be in that range. And obviously Olive Garden being over 50% of the portfolio, they'll have -- they weigh the Darden average too. And if you look back at last year, fiscal \u201824, we delivered 1.6% in same restaurant sales for Darden, and Olive Garden was right on top at 1.6%. So we'll see how this plays out, but we don't want to comment on Olive Garden versus LongHorn specifically.\nEric Gonzalez: Very good. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Charles with TD Cowan. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Charles: Great, thanks. Rick, the question is on Olive Garden. You called out multiple levers at your disposal to help properly go traffic beyond marketing. Can you expand more on those opportunities? Is it menu innovation? Is it the to-go business, the catering business? Just to welcome more thoughts on how to sustain the traffic gap versus the industry?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Andrew. Yes to all. Now, remember, Raj said we did exceed industry benchmarks. Olive Garden has taken much lower pricing than Darden over the year and the industries over the years. And we're really proud of their team. We're really proud of Dan and the team and what they've done. You know, they're going to continue to focus their marketing on their key equity of never-ending, craveable, abundant Italian food, specifically focusing on ensuring every guest is offered a refill with their first course. That's something that's not provided in other competitors. So that refill is a pretty big part of what we do and a big part of their value equation. But we're also going to continue to innovate over in our menu. What you see right now on television if you haven't is our Create Your Own pasta at $12.99. You know, consumers in more challenging times are looking for more price certainty, and that is an amazing value to create your own pasta at $12.99 with unlimited first course. And we'll continue to focus our marketing efforts there. And we have digital marketing that we can pull as well. So without getting into all the details, we do have levers to pull, but I want to remind everybody we're focused on profitable sales growth, not just buying sales to show a top line number. And we've been very consistent over the years with that. That profitable sales growth is what matters and Raj talked about our EBITDA growth over the last five years, how strong it was. And so we'll continue to focus there.\nAndrew Charles: Okay, great. And my final question is about the Ruth's acquisition for franchisee. Curious if this leaves you open-minded for more franchise acquisitions in 2025 or if this one was perhaps more one-off?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, let me start by saying the franchisees at Ruth's Chris are really valued partners to us. And our focus was on integrating our company on restaurants into Darden. You know, this one restaurant franchise was an opportunistic purchase. So, you know, we're going to continue as is and speak with our franchisees if they want to speak with us, but right now we're going to continue to focus on making sure our team gets acclimated to the systems that we've implemented. And so it's not necessarily a change in strategy. It was an opportunistic purchase for us.\nAndrew Charles: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. Raj, I just wanted to come back to the guidance for the year. And I think you mentioned that you have assumed that you expect underlying traffic to improve as the year moves on. So I just wanted to ask if you could elaborate on what factors you think will drive that improvement? Is it mostly just comparisons related or are you thinking there's something inside the business that will improve on a sequential basis as the year moves on?\nRaj Vennam: David, it's primarily driven by the comparables, but the underlying trends have held up pretty well. I mean, even if you look at our fourth quarter that we just came off, month-to-month underlying trends were actually held up pretty steady, and it was an improvement from Q3. And you know, we talked about what we're seeing on the check side, that's also a positive sign. So we think there is, you know, just as we cycle through some of the weakness, that should help us gradually get better through the year.\nDavid Tarantino: Got it. And then, Rick, on Olive Garden, I guess a question I would have is on the advertising approach, do you see an opportunity to better highlight the value you're already offering? Not necessarily provide a new discount or something different than what you're adding, but it seems like that brand has a great value proposition. I'm just wondering if you think there's an opportunity to emphasize that a bit more in the advertising?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, David and that's exactly what we're doing right now. You know, on TV right now, we've got our Create Your Own Pasta at $12.99 with the price point on the television. And, you know, we do believe that Olive Garden has a great everyday value. And so what we -- the things that we can do to continue to highlight that versus discounting is what we'll continue to do.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.\nJim Salera: Hi guys, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Can you just give us some of the puts and takes on the 3% inflation guide for 2025, particularly what you're thinking around the food basket and labor?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Jim. So this is Raj. So on the food basket, we're basically assuming commodities to be around 2%. I think the biggest driver within the food basket is beef. We still expect beef to be in the mid-single-digits. And then we actually expect low-single-digit deflation in chicken. And then pretty much all other categories are probably going to be in that low-single-digit inflation. And so that's how we're getting to commodities being around 2%. From a labor perspective, we are actually expecting labor to be more like a 4% overall. So if you think about where we've been and what the hourly wage inflation is expected to be closer to 4% and then total labor to be around 4%. So those are the two big things. And then from all other restaurant expenses are probably going to be more in that 2.5% to 3%. And that's how we're getting to that overall being closer to 3%.\nJim Salera: Okay, great. Thanks for the detail on that. And then if I could maybe try to tie that to the consumer. You mentioned earlier one of the concerns or chief concerns for the consumer is just kind of overall inflation. If we see inflation maybe come in at the lower end of your expectations. Is it possible that, that could also provide better-than-expected lift on the comp side, given that consumers maybe feel a little bit better about how far their dollar goes? Just trying to think of kind of the catalyst path for the consumer into 2025, what might make the results from the consumer be better than what you're anticipating?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Jim, The consumer is really focused on what price they're paying in everywhere, not just in restaurants. And if you think about the cost that they have on the non-discretionary costs, they've been growing faster than wages for quite a few years, and that eats into discretionary spending. So if inflation in the non-discretionary gets better, that may give them a little bit more discretionary. And if you're considering food at the grocery store or food a non-discretionary, then yes, that should help. But we'd like to see some lower inflation in things like things that people have to buy. Rent, utilities, child care, all of those things would help on the non-discretionary side, help discretionary spend.\nJim Salera: That's great. Thanks for the color, guys. I'll hop back in the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nSara Senatore: Great, thank you. I guess, I wanted one clarification and then a question, please. The clarification is just, you mentioned pricing, like 1% in Olive Garden and pricing below inflation, but your food margins were better than we had expected. So I just wanted to understand like what the dynamic might have been across brands, whether there was any mix. I mean, presumably all of them actually some of the best food margins. So if you could just help me unpack that a little bit. And then I do have a question about the demand environment.\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Sara. Good morning. So when we look at the fourth quarter, yes, our pricing was across Darden was below inflation. I think our pricing was closer to 2.5, inflation was around 3. So there is a board. I think the delta was almost 70 basis points. But that, again, goes back to the testament of our teams and our ability to manage through different cycles, right, through different environments. We've talked about how in a slow growth environment, we should see costs get better, but also we should see our own -- the controllables be even more -- come in even better. So ultimately, it's just a testament to our teams, how well they manage the business, with the focus on getting to the returns we need to get for the business.\nSara Senatore: Okay, and those controllables sit even in the cog line?\nRaj Vennam: There is some, yes.\nSara Senatore: Okay, got it. Thank you. And then the question on demand is, to some of the earlier comments you've made, perhaps the demand environment is softer-than-expected in so far as the issue with your comps is you're still taking share, but I'm interpreting it to mean perhaps versus where we expected, given the low-income consumer primarily, I think. I'm trying to, I guess, ask when you think about where that expectation was when you acquired Ruth and kind of doubled down on fine dining, had you anticipated something more robust or there was always an expectation of normalization and even in that context the acquisition makes sense.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Sara. This is Rick. When we acquired Ruth's, we think about an acquisition over a long, long period of time. We're not as worried about the next quarter or the quarter after the acquisition. Now, would we have liked the consumer at the below-median income to continue to go to fine dining? Absolutely, but any time we make an acquisition, there could be a chance that it's because we're going into a slowdown and maybe there's a little bit of a better opportunity for price discovery there. So, I would never read into when we make an acquisition into a certain category or not. Remember, we have criteria for our M&A and Ruth's met every one of that criteria, and we were able to agree on our price. So that's why it happened at the time it happened. And generally, that's when any of our M&A will happen, as long as we find the brands that meet the criteria and we get price discovery and we agree on a price and we'll do that deal, we're not worried about the environment that we're going into or that we're coming out of because these are long, long-term investments for us.\nSara Senatore: That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you. Rick, my first question is just on the weakening conditions you mentioned in the back half, it does seem like within your portfolio, at least, Olive Garden was hit harder, and I guess relative to the industry as well, which I think is contrary to past economic slowdowns when most people look at Olive Garden as the more defensive value brand. So I'm just wondering, as you take a step back, what do you think has changed this go-around? How much of it is maybe internally what you're doing versus maybe what the competition is doing and if you can give any sequential color on the trends through the quarter or into June just to kind of get a sense of how we're starting fiscal \u201825, that would be great. And then I had one follow-up.\nRick Cardenas: Sure, Jeff. I'm not going to talk about the trends into fiscal \u201825 where we are. And I think Raj had mentioned that the quarterly -- fourth quarter, we were pretty consistent month-over-month, month to month to month. So -- but I will say for Olive Garden, in prior slowdowns, Olive Garden outperformed. They outperformed at the same restaurant sales and at that time they were taking more pricing than everybody else. We outperformed this quarter in traffic and we've continued to outperform the industry in traffic for the last many years and we only took 1% pricing. What I would tell you is that if we would have taken the pricing that the industry took in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, I'm sorry, Olive Garden would have been positive and would have performed even more. And so this is a long game for us. The other thing that we aren't -- that we're not pulling are things that everybody or not everybody, but people used to pull in slowdowns, couponing, deep discounting and all those other things and we're not doing that even at a time that our competitors have ramped up discounting, deep discounting on television and, you know, Olive Garden still outperformed in traffic, didn't outperform in comp sales, but as I said, we only took 1% pricing. And so we're really, really proud of that and we'll continue to do that. And maybe that's why we didn't outperform on the sales side, but we did continue to outperform on the traffic side. And I just want to say their gap in fiscal Q4 was 60 basis points in traffic, and their two-year gap is 530 basis points in traffic. So we feel pretty good with where they are.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Absolutely. And then my follow-up, Raj, as you think about, well, as you're setting up a guidance for fiscal \u201825, you mentioned how in fiscal \u201824, you beat your initial EPS guidance despite seemingly falling short on the initial fiscal \u201824 comp guidance and as you look at \u201825 wondering as we enter the year it seems like maybe if there was a risk that it's the same scenario where I mean just looking at the fourth quarter your comps were below the fiscal \u201825 guide. So what leverage do you have on the margin and earnings side to maybe beat the comps -- if the comps would again fall short as we move through fiscal \u201825? It would seem like you don't have as much opportunity with inflation easing as maybe you had this past year. So how do you think about the outlook for fiscal \u201825 if the comps were to fall short? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Jeff. So I don't want to get into the exact details, but let me say a high level and talk about how we think about philosophically, right? If the environment is such that the sales continue to be weaker, that also implies the demand is weaker and the inflation should be a little bit better. So let's start with that. And in fact, if you look at last year, that was part of the reason we were able to exceed the earnings guidance even with the sales off. That's not all of it, but that's partial. The other part of it is how we manage through the -- through how our teams manage through the cycle. So as I said earlier, our restaurant teams and our teams at the support center work very hard to kind of, you know, have these targets and we work towards them and we're always trying to get better. And there's just even more push on that when things are a little bit softer on the top line. So that's kind of how I talk about it. I don't want to get into the specifics because, you know, this is a big business. It's very complex. There are a lot of nuances. There's a lot of -- but there's a lot that goes in to get to where we need to get to. And we feel, I think if you just look back, it shows that we have the ability to get there to a different base.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. Thanks, Raj.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. Olive Garden's strategy has been to sort of set itself up as a well-positioned everyday value and a strong consumer service. Do you see the consumer recognizing this? Like are the consumer satisfaction scores at Olive Garden doing as well versus the peer group in Italian as say LongHorn or Texas Roadhouse are doing in stake?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, David, I won't comment on how they're doing versus their competition, but I can tell you as Olive Garden, both internally and externally, their value ratings have increased over this last year. And they're pretty close to the top end of the value and overall in the measures we look at. I also mentioned they were kind of at the highest levels of guest satisfaction in this fiscal year. But again, they continue in all of our brands. Most of our brands -- I think all of our brands were at or above their value perceptions externally versus last year?\nDavid Palmer: Yes. I guess, I'm wondering why you think the traffic share gains are not stronger. Is it just simply the consumer awareness of the value that's at Olive Garden? Or is it perhaps something about the Italian category, such as the ease of trading down to at-home posts a little easier we're seeing very strong growth in, for instance, Rayo\u2019s Sauces lately. So we're seeing scratch cooking really picking up in at-home, we're not seeing a strong stake demand at-home. So I'm wondering if there's sort of an interaction index with at-home trade down that's stronger in the Italian category. Do you have any thoughts on that?\nRick Cardenas: Well, there may be interaction trade down to at-home because of the median income consumer, it's not necessarily the Italian. But I can tell you where we compete in the full service base, Olive Garden was at 75th percentile in their traffic. So -- and again, when you're comparing how they're doing in full service. And then we're putting in this at-home, everybody is dealing with the at-home as well, not just Italian. And then finally, the competitors had ramped up very deep discounting and while we had -- we didn't see that actually impacting Olive Garden or our other brands, because the trends kind of stayed similar. What we did see, interestingly, is a little bit of a shift from QSR to some of those competitors. And so that might be where they're trying to take some share from. But we did see that and that lifted the industry index in some of those -- and maybe one of those competitors, which is a big part of the index. So there's a little bit of a nuance in how the index works, especially when you're taking share from another category -- another part of the index.\nDavid Palmer: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks, guys. Just wondering if you could speak to the development environment a bit more. It seems like consistent expectations as it relates to new builds. But anything you're seeing there sort of on timing, thinking about build cost, et cetera?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Dennis. I will -- let me start by saying that the new restaurant projection we have for next year is within our long-term framework. So while it's lower than we like it to be, it's still within our long-term framework. And recall, the new restaurants also include M&A. So we bought about 80 restaurants from Ruth\u2019s Chris that were part of last year. Now that's not impacting this year, but it is part of our framework construction costs are still quite a bit higher than they were before COVID, but the levels are normalizing more and it's still taking a little longer to get construction starts. We're just trying to figure out ways to improve our process to potentially get starts moving a little bit faster. And maybe there is some things that we can do to help municipalities with kind of working on permitting and other things, But we feel pretty good about our pipeline for next year. We'd like to see it higher for the years after, but we're not going to just build restaurants and put a number out there that we don't think that we can hit, and we feel pretty good about where we are. And again, Raj showed you where we were for the last five years in our new unit growth. It was almost 3%. It was 2.9%, which is at the high-end of our framework. So we don't necessarily think year-to-year, we think long-term.\nDennis Geiger: Thanks, Rick. And one more, just curious if you could comment a little more on sort of what your expectation is for the industry promotional environment for the year. Is what we're seeing sustainable? Can it increase? I know there's 1 million factors that go into this. But just given your perspective, would love any thoughts on what over the next three quarters or so, what the industry environment on promo discounting, et cetera, looks like in your opinion? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Dennis, I think my perspective is -- we like what we're doing better, right? We don't think that we think that everyday low value and continue to focus on our core equities is more sustainable than deep discounting to try to drive people in. Others can do that, and we'll continue to play this long game. And over time, you have to keep wrapping on that. If you do a deep discount and it stays the same way, you have to do even more the next year, you have to do more television. And we just think we'd rather do more great food, more great service, and let's wrap that. And so again, I can't comment on what other people think is sustainable or not. We just think our business, the way we do it is more sustainable.\nDennis Geiger: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Saleh: Great, thanks. Raj, I wanted to ask on the flat mix, which I think you mentioned was a pretty meaningful improvement from what you've seen in the past couple of quarters. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on what's driving this? Is this alcohol mix improving entrees consumers trading up to more expensive entree, the appetizers. And is there any way to dissect this by income cohort? Are you seeing more improvement from the lower income, higher income, anything you can glean there?\nRaj Vennam: Hey Peter. Yes, just to start, that was specifically at Olive Garden and LongHorn. And so when we look at -- and it's different for both brands. So when you look at LongHorn the mix was driven by some add-ons, increased add-ons. They had a great -- they also had a new Lamb Entree that actually was that did really well. There was parmesan crusting, people wanted to get more of that. So there were things like that were helpful with the mix. What we -- alcohol is kind of fairly stabilized. So it's not necessarily a headwind anymore. And so that's probably helping but when you look at Olive Garden, the same thing where people are not -- we're not seeing as much trade down within the -- whether it's the entree trade down or not getting add-ons. So just in general, more stabilization and so maybe this is -- the guest that's coming in today is not managing the check as much. And so that's different from maybe some of the guests that were coming in earlier in the fiscal year.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your questions.\nJeff Farmer: Great. Good morning and thank you. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. With the 1% to 2% FY \u201825 same-store sales guidance, you pointed to the 2.5% to 3% menu pricing. But can you give us a little bit of color as it relates to both traffic and mix assumptions for FY \u201825 guidance?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, I think it's fair to assume that our check is probably going to be in that range of 2.5% to 3%. So you can back into the implied traffic. So we do expect the mix to be fairly flat.\nJeff Farmer: Okay. And then I might have missed it, but G&A dollars in FY \u201825, did you provide that guidance?\nRaj Vennam: You did not miss it. We haven't talked about it. The G&A for this year, we should be closer to $450 million for fiscal '21, it should be closer to $450 million. And I think that's going to be spread fairly evenly from second to the fourth quarter, with the first quarter to be $20 million higher than those three quarters. It's just typical that we have a little bit more in the first half.\nJeff Farmer: All right. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jon Tower with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\nJon Tower: Great, thanks. I appreciate you taking. Going to the cost side of the equation, it was pretty impressive even with the comp that you put up in the fourth quarter, how you were able to manage labor and the other op expense line very well. And I'm just curious if you could dig into how you expect those lines to play out in fiscal '24 or better said, do you think a lot of the management that you're able to put in across labor as well as the other OpEx can carry forward into fiscal '25 kind of offsetting some of that inflation that you're seeing.\nRaj Vennam: Hi, John, so if you look at the drivers this year, we talked about improved productivity. That was -- a part of that was also driven by lower turnover. And so there may be a few quarters where we'll still get a little bit of that benefit, but as we look to next year, I would expect -- we would expect COGS to be better because commodities inflation is likely going to be, as I said, closer to that 2% and then pricing being a little bit more, you should get some leverage on that line. We do expect to continue to look at other OpEx, right? That's one of the things non-guest-facing cost is where we spend a lot of time looking at how do we continue to get better. And that's the power of the platform. That's the power of having this big multiple brands and being able to learn from each other. And the last piece is, there is some continuing synergies from Ruth's acquisition that we talked about. We got about half this year. We're going to get the rest next year. So those are all different drivers of how we get that margin growth.\nJon Tower: Got it. Thank you. And I know a lot has been talked about today on the marketing side. So I'm just curious, one more, I guess, on the topic. In terms of the way that you're speaking to the consumer, I know you're using traditional television as a primary means to communicate Olive Garden's message. But I'm just curious if you could dig into what you're doing on social and how you might be changing the brand's perception on those platforms or even in traditional media, are you going after different day parts in terms of where you're advertising even platforms where you're advertising through linear media. Maybe just more information there would be great.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, John. For several years, we've been building our internal digital media capabilities, and we've done -- Olive Garden is the only one on television. Everybody else does spend marketing and it's in digital. And we've been testing things like connected television. We've been testing other things to help drive our traffic. And because we've been testing this allows us to kind of move them into other brands to see how they work. We do a lot of test and learn -- and so we don't expect our media to grow significantly year-over-year because we think we're more efficient with the tests that we do. And so as we continue to do that, we know what the right times to put messages out there. We know what days and we knew all those things. So we're not necessarily going to think about ramping up a communication of a certain day part unless the brand thinks it's the right thing to do. And so they might -- we might see some brands talk about a certain day part or not. But we are using our digital that we've learned over the years and we have an internal team here that's great at what they do and we'll continue to focus on that.\nJon Tower: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nChris O'Cull: Yes thanks. Rick, you mentioned several sales building opportunities earlier. But I was wondering if you think there are any opportunities to improve throughput during high demand peak periods at Olive Garden? I'm assuming the restaurants are still in a way during traditional peak periods like Friday and Saturday nights.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Chris, I think not just at Olive Garden, but all our brands can do more to improve throughput in our peak periods. We can get a little bit quicker in what we do to make sure that the guest doesn't feel rush, but they don't feel like they're waiting for a lot of things. So we do think that there's opportunities and not just at Olive Garden, and if we can do that better, we should get some -- at least some traffic in that day if people were walking away. But in the long run, getting a little bit quicker, maybe better for us any day, not just on the peak periods.\nChris O'Cull: Okay. And then, Raj, Olive Garden segment margin contracted, I think, 70 basis points this quarter, while the other segments or the other segments saw some considerable year-over-year expansion. Can you help us understand what drove that pressure? And do you see other -- those factors putting pressure on Olive Garden this going into fiscal '25.\nRaj Vennam: No, Chris, I think it's actually just kind of normalizing what they should have been, right? Last year, I think we had a little too high margin. I mean, to be 22.8% segment profit margin is industry leading. I mean that's just -- that's just really high. That would be aspirational for a lot of brands in this industry. So to be able to get to those levels. And frankly, it goes back to the -- our decision to not price as much, right? And we had talked about it last year. We didn't think 23.5% segment profit was the right number. That was a little too high. And so it's really giving back a little bit of that. But we don't expect that to be like a -- as we look -- move forward, we don't expect that to be a drag going forward. It's just more of -- there were some things that needed to be normalized.\nChris O'Cull: Perfect. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Raj, given your focus on more profitable traffic and cost control, cost management in this environment, can you help us understand the flow-through of the marginal dollar today and how it compares with the marginal dollar flow-through back in, say, 2019?\nRaj Vennam: Hey Danilo, I think the flow-through from the marginal dollar is not that different. It is actually fairly similar. It's just there are other things that are more non-variable costs that we're also looking at. So it's not -- that's how we're getting to that. But from a high level, if you look at across the portfolio, somewhere around 35% to 40% is probably the right flow-through to think about it. And I don't think that's any different from where we were before in 2019.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Okay, thank you. And Rick, just from a long-term perspective, can you share maybe the rationale and timing behind these recent executive changes? And in particular, what you're expecting from your team in their newly created roles and specifically, if you can comment on kind of post promotion and kind of the role of the Chief Business Development Officer, what are you expecting out of that? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Danilo, as I said in the prepared remarks, these changes help set us up for future growth and developing our leaders. So if you think about Todd and John elevating their roles a little bit, Todd leading development, international and franchising and Ruth's Chris. And those all have really good synergies for Todd, right? So development in new restaurants, that's for all brands but international franchising with the percent of restaurants that Ruth's Chris has his franchise, it's actually a pretty good synergy there. Plus, as I said, Todd, came with -- came to us from rare hospitality when we bought them. So he knows what it's like after the systems integration and how to help people assimilate more. And he'll help Rick, who's our new President, become a great President. And then finally, as I mentioned, having an operator\u2019s perspective and new restaurant development, I think, is a pretty good thing to do. We think about how to do the turnovers better how to get -- make sure we are more planful in telling the brands when we think the restaurant is going to open. So there aren't moves and delays, so we can get those a little bit better. So that's really where Todd comes into play. And then on John's side, if you think about the specialty restaurant group with five brands and John leading all five, that was a lot. And so how do we help bring him up and bring the new president underneath John, who are all proven leaders and all have a good future here with us, while John can help them become even better brand presidents. A couple of them -- one of them is a former finance person, but he's got a great operations knowledge, and he actually was a restaurant manager many, many years ago. But John can help Mark become a better general manager and think more about operations. You've got Falon Farrell, who's now going to be leading Capital Grille and Eddie V's. Actually, Falon started at Capital Grille as a team member, and she worked at Capital Grille for many years. And then she led training for Capital Grille, and Eddie V\u2019s. And now she -- then she led Eddie V\u2019s for quite a while in operation. So she can see how do we bring some synergies in the support center for Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s to help leverage those brands better, but while working for John who can continue to develop her for the future. And then I think about Bryan Clements. Bryan, his history, he started a big bar brands years ago. He spent many years at LongHorn to understand how LongHorn and a simple operating model works and he spent time at Olive Garden, leading Olive Garden operations, and that's a big system. And how do you think about a big system when you've got Yard House who's passing 80 restaurants, and we want to continue to grow them, and he can help with more system thinking at Yard House. So we think it's a really great move for all of them. And Laura, I didn't mention Laura is a great leader here at Darden. And she spent nine years at LongHorn. She really knows LongHorn. And she's got a great relationship with Todd. She'll be able to continue to talk to Todd and the team at LongHorn has rallied around her. So our reasoning behind that is to get people ready, while other people are basically retirement eligible. And so we want to make sure that they're here to help them progress. And you know what our retirement programs are not saying that anybody is leaving anytime soon, but this gives them a chance to develop people while they're still around.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndy Barish: Hey guys, two quick ones. Just hearing some commentary on the softer Florida market where you guys kind of over-index, any thoughts there? And then if you could give us the Olive Garden to Go mix for the fiscal year '24 versus '23? And is there -- any trends you're seeing there, any impact on maybe some of the same-store sales components, just not remembering how you guys calculate that fully?\nRaj Vennam: All right. Andy, let's start with the trends themselves. So if we actually look at the last quarter, and I may have mentioned in the prior quarter, too, but Florida, Texas and California generally were a little bit weaker. We saw that not just Florida, but Texas and California. And did contribute to the top line being where it was. And so that's -- I don't know that we have a strong explanation for why one of the thoughts was maybe some of these markets that opened faster coming out of COVID might be the ones where we're seeing a little bit of softness and maybe a little bit of strength on the ones that opened a little bit later coming out of COVID but that's just a hypothesis. But that's -- the facts are, you're seeing some strength in the New England market and other things and not as much in California, Texas and Florida. As we look at our to-go mix, -- to go mix at Olive Garden was basically at -- I think for the year, 24%, which is fairly similar to last year, not a huge -- not much change. And LongHorn is at 14% think we saw a little bit of an improvement year-over-year like 1 point or so at LongHorn on the quarter, but that's just fairly stabilized there. And I think there was another question about some mix I can't -- what was the -- was there another one, Andy, that I missed?\nAndy Barish: Yes. No. Just if the to-go trend had or decline if that was impacting any of the components of same-store sales, but it doesn't sound like that.\nRaj Vennam: No, it's not yes.\nAndy Barish: Okay, thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Vaccaro: Hey, thanks. And good morning. I know we're running off. So just two quick ones for me. Can you provide traffic and check for Olive Garden and LongHorn in the fourth quarter? And then, Raj, did I hear correctly blended price up 2.5% to 3% for the fiscal '25 and that seems stable. So does that suggest you've taken price recently? And could see that range as early as the first quarter?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Brian, the blended -- let me start with the later question first. Yes, the blended in the 2.5% to 3%. We have taken some pricing -- we are -- yes, typically, we take some in June, so there's some pricing. So you should start to see some of that in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, our total check growth was 2.2% at Darden level, I think Olive Garden was more like a one-third, and LongHorn was probably in the 3-ish percent, LongHorn has positive traffic. The traffic growth, I think, in the quarter was 0.8%. So in the total SRS is 4%, so the check growth was at on 3.2%.\nBrian Vaccaro: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nJake Bartlett: Great, thanks for taking the question. I want to dig in on that last question and answer a little bit more, and that's pricing at Olive Garden. Pricing decelerated to 1% in the fourth quarter. You talked about comps being similar across the brand in '25 and pretty stable pricing throughout the year. Does that imply that you're going to see a pretty big step-up in menu price at Olive Garden? Or should we expect kind of a similar, much more cautious pricing at Olive Garden throughout the whole year?\nRaj Vennam: I'm sorry, I was on mute. If you look at Olive Garden's pricing for the year, fiscal year, they were actually close to mid-3s. And so that's pretty consistent, not all the way to where Darden blended was 4. So they're about 50 or 70, 80 basis points below Darden. As we think about next year, they're not going to -- we would expect them to be maybe in the 30, 40 basis points range of where Darden might end up. So I don't expect this to be as big of a gap. But we're still -- we're not talking about huge pricing actions, right? We talked about -- there is always some timing of the quarter-to-quarter. But on the year, if we think 2.5% to 3%, Olive Garden is probably closer to 2.5%\nJake Bartlett: Got it. But I think that would imply that in the near-term, you'd be taking up pricing in Olive Garden in this environment, this macro environment. I'm wondering whether you think that creates a little bit of risk to traffic even from where we started. If you can maybe answer that, but then I also just had a follow-up on the Fast Recovery Act in California, and you guys have a decent presence there, and I think we haven't gotten a lot of commentary about the impact. It seems like some pretty seismic impacts in California impact on labor, but also shift in demand maybe from limited service into casual dining. So any comment there on what you've seen over the last few months as the -- as the fast recovery actually implemented?\nRick Cardenas: Hey Jake, this is Rick. I'm going to start on the fact act with saying that our employment proposition is great in California. So we've got a great one there. On average, our team members earn well over $20 an hour. And California only represents about 5% of our restaurants. So it's not like it's an over-index for us. We haven't seen a real impact in wages. And since the FAST Act came about, but unfortunately, we have seen many closures of fast food restaurants in that time. And so our California performance for the quarter was still not as strong as the company, as you said. But as Raj said, we did see some softness in California, but I think that was more related to some weather there than anything else. But again, we haven't seen a whole lot of change in our wages. Our employment proposition is great in California. But we have seen some fast food restaurants, unfortunately, have to close because of the act.\nJake Bartlett: Thank you. [Technical Difficulty] can you price at Olive Garden now in this environment?\nRaj Vennam: So Jake, I'll go back to the pricing actions, some of this is timing of when you take actions. Every year, there's a little bit of pricing action, right? And this year, or in fiscal '24, we did not have any pricing action until pretty late into maybe Q4, middle of Q4. So that's just already there. It's not a lot of pricing on top. Some of that is also moving to years, right, some restaurants in different markets as things change with the environment and minimum wage, we make some adjustments. But nothing crazy. If you look at -- I mentioned earlier and in response to a different question, we have taken a lot less pricing at Olive Garden. So we're not worried about where they are. I mean if you look at over the five years, cumulatively, their CAGR is probably more in the 3.5% range when the industry is closer to 5% plus. So we feel like there's a better -- great value proposition at Olive Garden, and we try to keep prices as low as we can, and you've seen that.\nJake Bartlett: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nGregory Francfort: Hey, thanks for the question. My question is just -- I think it was asked on unit growth earlier in the call, and you guys were suggesting it makes sense to look at the long-term. I think you're opening up 15 to 20 or so Olive Gardens a year, which is one of the faster paces of growth we've seen in a long time. How many stores do you think Olive Garden could have on a long-term basis? You have a lot of competitors that are up at 1,200, 700 stores with a lot lower AUVs. Just sort of curious how you come up with the long-term target for Olive Garden. Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Greg, let me start by saying every time we come up with a target for Olive Garden, we blow past it. So we haven't really talked about a target for Olive Garden for a lot of years. What we have found over the last five or 10 years is that we can open more Olive Gardens in markets that Olive Gardens are already in, where prior to that, we weren't doing that as much. Convenience is important to consumers, and we'd rather be a little closer where they live. And so we do believe there's opportunities to open Olive Gardens for the foreseeable future, and we don't think we're near the top of the Olive Garden limit yet. Greg, did you have any other questions?\nGregory Francfort: No, no, that was it. I appreciate the perspective. Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Strelzick with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Strelzick: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had two quick ones for me. There's been a lot of discussion about the low-income consumer. I think last quarter, you said that you saw growth with the higher-end consumer at all of your segments. So I was hoping we could get an update there on how that is trending, if that's still what you're realizing. And then -- my second question is about the balance sheet, and you mentioned leverage being below the target. It's been that way for a bit now. So I'm just curious how you're thinking about what might narrow that gap or how you're thinking about leverage on the balance sheet going forward? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Andrew, let's start with the question around the incomes. We are seeing the higher income being a little bit better, and it varies from brand to brand. And as you can imagine, when you think about a brand that grew traffic for LongHorn, for example, they actually had growth pretty much across all income segments. But from a fine dining perspective, you're seeing growth at the higher end I wouldn't say that's just the median household. It actually has to go up north of 150 to see where we're seeing some growth. And then the pullback is mostly at the lower -- at the below middle median household income. And then the other segments are -- other income groups or cohorts are either stable or growing. And then on the balance sheet, we always work with our Board to figure out what's the best way to kind of really position ourselves. We like the flexibility we have -- and as we've always said, we want to use our balance sheet to get productive assets over time. And so that's still -- the philosophy remains the same.\nAndrew Strelzick: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Courtney Aquilla for closing remarks.\nCourtney Aquilla: That concludes our call. I want to remind you that we plan to release first quarter results on Thursday, September 19, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you for participating in today's call.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Raj Vennam",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. And good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2024 was another strong year for Darden, and I am proud of the results our teams achieved. Despite sales results that were weaker than we anticipated, earnings exceeded our initial expectations for the year. Strong cost management by our teams and easing commodities and labor inflation drove this earnings outperformance. Now looking at the fourth quarter, we generated $3 billion of total sales, 6.8% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 80 company-owned Ruth's Chris Steak House restaurants and 37 net new restaurants from our legacy brands. Our same restaurant sales were flat for the quarter, outpacing the industry by 80 basis points and same restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 130 basis points. Throughout the quarter our casual dining brands maintained their relative share of guest visits. Olive Garden guest count growth was near the top quartile of the industry and Long Horn Stake House was at the top decile of the industry. This is impressive when you consider the increased levels of discounting and promotional activity by some competitors within casual dining. Our same restaurant guest count or performance to the industry exceeded our same restaurant sales out performance due to our lower levels of pricing relative to the industry this quarter. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2.7% to $2.65. We generated $523 million in adjusted EBITDA and returned $254 million to shareholders through $156 million in dividends and $97 million of share repurchases. Turning to the fourth quarter P&L, compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 20 basis points better as commodities inflation was better-than-expected at approximately 2%. Seafood deflation this quarter helped partially offset mid-single-digit beef and produce inflation. Restaurant labor was 10 basis points better, driven by productivity improvements and favorability and other benefits, which more than offset the impact of pricing below labor inflation, which was approximately 4%. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points better than last year driven by strong cost management and lower pre-opening expenses. Marketing expense was 1.3% of sales, consistent with our expectations and 20 basis points higher than last year. This all resulted in restaurant-level EBITDA improving 20 basis points to 20.9%. Adjusted G&A expenses were 40 basis points lower and the total expense was slightly favorable to our previous guidance. This was driven by ongoing synergies from the integration of Ruth's Chris and favorable mark-to-market expense on our deferred compensation. Due to the way we hedge mark-to-market expense, this favorability is largely offset on the tax line. Interest expense increased 40 basis points due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth's Chris acquisition. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.4%, 40 basis points higher, driven by the mark-to-market hedge impact I referenced earlier. And we generated $318 million in adjusted earnings from continuing operations, which was 10.8% of sales. Looking at our segments for the quarter, Olive Garden increased total sales 0.7%, driven by new restaurant growth partially offset by negative same restaurant sales of 1.5%. While Olive Garden same restaurant sales were below the industry, same restaurant guest counts outperformed the industry benchmark by 60 basis points. This dynamic was due to our decision to minimize pricing. For the quarter, Olive Garden pricing was approximately 1%. Olive Garden segment profit margin of 22.8% continues to be industry leading. At LongHorn, total sales increased 7.2%, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 4% and new restaurant growth. LongHorn same restaurant sales outperformed the industry by 480 basis points. Segment profit margin of 19.1% was 50 basis points above last year. Strong cost management, including improved labor productivity drove LongHorn's margin growth this quarter as pricing was below inflation. Total sales at the fine dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants. And despite negative same restaurant sales at Capital Grille and Eddie V's, the fine dining segment's profit margin expanded in the fourth quarter, driven by improvement in our cost base. The other business segment sales increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris franchise and managed location revenue. This was partially offset by combined negative same restaurant sales of 1.1% for the brands in the other segment. Segment profit margin of 17.4% was 160 basis points better than last year, driven by the sales leverage from the additional royalty revenue. As we look at our annual results for fiscal 2024, we had same restaurant sales growth of 1.6%, outperforming the industry in same restaurant sales and traffic by about 300 basis points. And this is on top of 500 basis points of outperformance in traffic last year. We delivered $1.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. This is an increase of over 50%, compared to five years ago. Additionally, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders with $628 million in dividends and $454 million in share repurchases. Looking at our fiscal 2024 full-year P&L, we had restaurant-level EBITDA growth of 120 basis points driven by strong cost management by our teams and pricing leverage. This favorability was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense and the impairment expense related to eight permanent closures that occurred during the year. This resulted in operating income margin that was 50 basis points higher than last year. Additional financing expenses primarily related to the Ruth's Chris acquisition drove adjusted interest expense 40 basis points higher than last year. This all resulted in adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 9.4% flat to last year. Looking at our performance since 2019 relative to our long-term framework, we generated annualized EAT growth of 8% and cash returns of 3.7%, culminating in total shareholder returns of 11.7% as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield. This is well within our targeted range despite the issuance of 9 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2020 and other business disruptions from COVID. A strong operating model generates significant and durable cash flows. Since 2019, we have delivered 9% annualized adjusted EBITDA growth. Our balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2024 is well positioned with adjusted debt to EBITDAR at 1.9 times. This is below our targeted range of 2 times to 2.5 times, even with the additional debt related to Ruth's Chris acquisition. Now turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2025, we expect total sales of $11.8 billion to $11.9 billion, driven by same restaurant sales growth of 1% to 2% and 45 to 50 gross new restaurants. Capital spending of $550 million to $600 million, total inflation of approximately 3%, which includes commodities inflation of approximately 2% and labor inflation of approximately 4%. An annual effective tax rate of approximately 13% and approximately 119 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. All of this results in diluted net earnings per share between $9.40 and $9.60. Finally, our board approved a 7% increase to our regular quarterly dividend to $1.40 per share, implying an annual dividend of $5.60. And with that, I'll turn it back to Rick. Hey, Brian, this is Raj. Good morning. So let's just start with the guidance at a high level from a sales outlook, right? Before we get into the brand level. So when we take a look at the upcoming year, we look at the information that's out there and where the macro is expected to be. And as you all know, most economists are expecting weakening GDP growth. So that's taken into consideration. Then we're also taking into consideration what we're cycling through, right? We started to see a little bit more weakness in the back half of this fiscal year, so we're taking that into consideration as we look at next year. So when we look at how we built this estimate and guidance, we are -- we expect underlying traffic trends to gradually improve throughout the year. And so that's really how we built it. I don't want to get into the exact details on the brands, but at a blended level, we're thinking 1% to 2% same restaurant sales growth for the full-year. And as I said, gradual improvement through the year on the underlying trends. And then there's just one callout is Thanksgiving shifts out of Q2 into Q3. So Q2 print might look better than the underlying trends, and Q3 will be the opposite. So that's typically about somewhere around 80 to 100 basis points impact on sales in the quarter. Positive for Q2, negative for Q3. And so all that said, in this current environment, there's more variability around our sales guide, but we have higher levels of confidence in our earnings outlook. And so, that's kind of where we are. Yes, Brian, the good news on pricing is we've actually kept pricing very modest over the last five years, right? So we do expect pricing for this year to be more in line with inflation, so in that 2.5% to 3% range probably. But as we think about how that's going to be spread, we expect it to be more consistent quarter-to-quarter. Now, there may be a 10, 20 basis points movement between quarters. But if you look at over the last five years, we've only priced a lot and that gives us some flexibility and we've talked about that before. So we've underpriced about 20% over the last five years, compared to where the overall CPI is, which I think was close to 23% on the same five-year basis and then full services at 28%. And underpriced grocery as well. So we feel like we've done a lot of work on keeping prices low and we're going to continue to do that. And as you saw that in the fourth quarter too. We talked about Olive Garden closer to 1% pricing in the fourth quarter. Hey, Eric. So yes, we did. So if you think back to what we said earlier in the fiscal year, we were seeing a big negative mix on the check and we talked about that, especially both at casual brands and fine dining. And last quarter we said we started to see some moderation. And as we look at this year, this quarter, if we look at Olive Garden and LongHorn, basically the mix was flat. So basically there was no negative mix at all, which is a significant improvement. And then when you look at fine dining, you know, we saw some moderation in Q3 and that continues to moderate into Q4. I think we're now down into the 80, 90 basis points range in the negative mix versus the 200 or so that we were seeing a couple quarters ago. So we're just starting to see the ones that come to us are not managing the check as much as they used to. Eric, the way we are looking at it is most brands are going to be within the range we provide it. We are providing a 1% to 2%. I'm not going to get into the comments about the range between Olive Garden and LongHorn specifically, but when we look at 1% to 2%, we expect most brands to be in that range. And obviously Olive Garden being over 50% of the portfolio, they'll have -- they weigh the Darden average too. And if you look back at last year, fiscal \u201824, we delivered 1.6% in same restaurant sales for Darden, and Olive Garden was right on top at 1.6%. So we'll see how this plays out, but we don't want to comment on Olive Garden versus LongHorn specifically. David, it's primarily driven by the comparables, but the underlying trends have held up pretty well. I mean, even if you look at our fourth quarter that we just came off, month-to-month underlying trends were actually held up pretty steady, and it was an improvement from Q3. And you know, we talked about what we're seeing on the check side, that's also a positive sign. So we think there is, you know, just as we cycle through some of the weakness, that should help us gradually get better through the year. Yes, Jim. So this is Raj. So on the food basket, we're basically assuming commodities to be around 2%. I think the biggest driver within the food basket is beef. We still expect beef to be in the mid-single-digits. And then we actually expect low-single-digit deflation in chicken. And then pretty much all other categories are probably going to be in that low-single-digit inflation. And so that's how we're getting to commodities being around 2%. From a labor perspective, we are actually expecting labor to be more like a 4% overall. So if you think about where we've been and what the hourly wage inflation is expected to be closer to 4% and then total labor to be around 4%. So those are the two big things. And then from all other restaurant expenses are probably going to be more in that 2.5% to 3%. And that's how we're getting to that overall being closer to 3%. Yes, Sara. Good morning. So when we look at the fourth quarter, yes, our pricing was across Darden was below inflation. I think our pricing was closer to 2.5, inflation was around 3. So there is a board. I think the delta was almost 70 basis points. But that, again, goes back to the testament of our teams and our ability to manage through different cycles, right, through different environments. We've talked about how in a slow growth environment, we should see costs get better, but also we should see our own -- the controllables be even more -- come in even better. So ultimately, it's just a testament to our teams, how well they manage the business, with the focus on getting to the returns we need to get for the business. There is some, yes. Hey, Jeff. So I don't want to get into the exact details, but let me say a high level and talk about how we think about philosophically, right? If the environment is such that the sales continue to be weaker, that also implies the demand is weaker and the inflation should be a little bit better. So let's start with that. And in fact, if you look at last year, that was part of the reason we were able to exceed the earnings guidance even with the sales off. That's not all of it, but that's partial. The other part of it is how we manage through the -- through how our teams manage through the cycle. So as I said earlier, our restaurant teams and our teams at the support center work very hard to kind of, you know, have these targets and we work towards them and we're always trying to get better. And there's just even more push on that when things are a little bit softer on the top line. So that's kind of how I talk about it. I don't want to get into the specifics because, you know, this is a big business. It's very complex. There are a lot of nuances. There's a lot of -- but there's a lot that goes in to get to where we need to get to. And we feel, I think if you just look back, it shows that we have the ability to get there to a different base. Hey Peter. Yes, just to start, that was specifically at Olive Garden and LongHorn. And so when we look at -- and it's different for both brands. So when you look at LongHorn the mix was driven by some add-ons, increased add-ons. They had a great -- they also had a new Lamb Entree that actually was that did really well. There was parmesan crusting, people wanted to get more of that. So there were things like that were helpful with the mix. What we -- alcohol is kind of fairly stabilized. So it's not necessarily a headwind anymore. And so that's probably helping but when you look at Olive Garden, the same thing where people are not -- we're not seeing as much trade down within the -- whether it's the entree trade down or not getting add-ons. So just in general, more stabilization and so maybe this is -- the guest that's coming in today is not managing the check as much. And so that's different from maybe some of the guests that were coming in earlier in the fiscal year. Yes, I think it's fair to assume that our check is probably going to be in that range of 2.5% to 3%. So you can back into the implied traffic. So we do expect the mix to be fairly flat. You did not miss it. We haven't talked about it. The G&A for this year, we should be closer to $450 million for fiscal '21, it should be closer to $450 million. And I think that's going to be spread fairly evenly from second to the fourth quarter, with the first quarter to be $20 million higher than those three quarters. It's just typical that we have a little bit more in the first half. Yes. Hi, John, so if you look at the drivers this year, we talked about improved productivity. That was -- a part of that was also driven by lower turnover. And so there may be a few quarters where we'll still get a little bit of that benefit, but as we look to next year, I would expect -- we would expect COGS to be better because commodities inflation is likely going to be, as I said, closer to that 2% and then pricing being a little bit more, you should get some leverage on that line. We do expect to continue to look at other OpEx, right? That's one of the things non-guest-facing cost is where we spend a lot of time looking at how do we continue to get better. And that's the power of the platform. That's the power of having this big multiple brands and being able to learn from each other. And the last piece is, there is some continuing synergies from Ruth's acquisition that we talked about. We got about half this year. We're going to get the rest next year. So those are all different drivers of how we get that margin growth. No, Chris, I think it's actually just kind of normalizing what they should have been, right? Last year, I think we had a little too high margin. I mean, to be 22.8% segment profit margin is industry leading. I mean that's just -- that's just really high. That would be aspirational for a lot of brands in this industry. So to be able to get to those levels. And frankly, it goes back to the -- our decision to not price as much, right? And we had talked about it last year. We didn't think 23.5% segment profit was the right number. That was a little too high. And so it's really giving back a little bit of that. But we don't expect that to be like a -- as we look -- move forward, we don't expect that to be a drag going forward. It's just more of -- there were some things that needed to be normalized. Hey Danilo, I think the flow-through from the marginal dollar is not that different. It is actually fairly similar. It's just there are other things that are more non-variable costs that we're also looking at. So it's not -- that's how we're getting to that. But from a high level, if you look at across the portfolio, somewhere around 35% to 40% is probably the right flow-through to think about it. And I don't think that's any different from where we were before in 2019. All right. Andy, let's start with the trends themselves. So if we actually look at the last quarter, and I may have mentioned in the prior quarter, too, but Florida, Texas and California generally were a little bit weaker. We saw that not just Florida, but Texas and California. And did contribute to the top line being where it was. And so that's -- I don't know that we have a strong explanation for why one of the thoughts was maybe some of these markets that opened faster coming out of COVID might be the ones where we're seeing a little bit of softness and maybe a little bit of strength on the ones that opened a little bit later coming out of COVID but that's just a hypothesis. But that's -- the facts are, you're seeing some strength in the New England market and other things and not as much in California, Texas and Florida. As we look at our to-go mix, -- to go mix at Olive Garden was basically at -- I think for the year, 24%, which is fairly similar to last year, not a huge -- not much change. And LongHorn is at 14% think we saw a little bit of an improvement year-over-year like 1 point or so at LongHorn on the quarter, but that's just fairly stabilized there. And I think there was another question about some mix I can't -- what was the -- was there another one, Andy, that I missed? No, it's not yes. Yes. Yes, Brian, the blended -- let me start with the later question first. Yes, the blended in the 2.5% to 3%. We have taken some pricing -- we are -- yes, typically, we take some in June, so there's some pricing. So you should start to see some of that in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, our total check growth was 2.2% at Darden level, I think Olive Garden was more like a one-third, and LongHorn was probably in the 3-ish percent, LongHorn has positive traffic. The traffic growth, I think, in the quarter was 0.8%. So in the total SRS is 4%, so the check growth was at on 3.2%. I'm sorry, I was on mute. If you look at Olive Garden's pricing for the year, fiscal year, they were actually close to mid-3s. And so that's pretty consistent, not all the way to where Darden blended was 4. So they're about 50 or 70, 80 basis points below Darden. As we think about next year, they're not going to -- we would expect them to be maybe in the 30, 40 basis points range of where Darden might end up. So I don't expect this to be as big of a gap. But we're still -- we're not talking about huge pricing actions, right? We talked about -- there is always some timing of the quarter-to-quarter. But on the year, if we think 2.5% to 3%, Olive Garden is probably closer to 2.5% So Jake, I'll go back to the pricing actions, some of this is timing of when you take actions. Every year, there's a little bit of pricing action, right? And this year, or in fiscal '24, we did not have any pricing action until pretty late into maybe Q4, middle of Q4. So that's just already there. It's not a lot of pricing on top. Some of that is also moving to years, right, some restaurants in different markets as things change with the environment and minimum wage, we make some adjustments. But nothing crazy. If you look at -- I mentioned earlier and in response to a different question, we have taken a lot less pricing at Olive Garden. So we're not worried about where they are. I mean if you look at over the five years, cumulatively, their CAGR is probably more in the 3.5% range when the industry is closer to 5% plus. So we feel like there's a better -- great value proposition at Olive Garden, and we try to keep prices as low as we can, and you've seen that. Andrew, let's start with the question around the incomes. We are seeing the higher income being a little bit better, and it varies from brand to brand. And as you can imagine, when you think about a brand that grew traffic for LongHorn, for example, they actually had growth pretty much across all income segments. But from a fine dining perspective, you're seeing growth at the higher end I wouldn't say that's just the median household. It actually has to go up north of 150 to see where we're seeing some growth. And then the pullback is mostly at the lower -- at the below middle median household income. And then the other segments are -- other income groups or cohorts are either stable or growing. And then on the balance sheet, we always work with our Board to figure out what's the best way to kind of really position ourselves. We like the flexibility we have -- and as we've always said, we want to use our balance sheet to get productive assets over time. And so that's still -- the philosophy remains the same."

            "content": "Thank you, Courtney. Before I begin, I would like to thank Kevin Kalicak for his leadership of Investor Relations for close to 10-years. As many of you know, Kevin has moved to Lead Finance for Olive Garden. We are excited for his new opportunity and equally excited to have Courtney transition into leading investor relations. I'm confident you will find Courtney a worthy successor. Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our ability to stay disciplined and control what we can control. This continued focus enabled us to have a strong year in what became an increasingly weaker consumer environment, especially for consumers below the median household income. For the full-year, we grew total sales by 8.6% to $11.4 billion, delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $8.88, an increase of 11%, exceeding the high-end of the EPS range we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year, despite the challenging sales environment that emerged in the back half of the year. We opened 53 new restaurants in 24 states, eight of which were reopenings, and acquired and completed the integration of Ruth's Chris Steak House. Throughout the year, we strengthened and defended our four competitive advantages, and our restaurants remained focused on being brilliant with the basics. This has enabled us to successfully navigate whatever comes our way, including the increased discounting and marketing pressure we've seen recently. And when evaluating our performance within the context of our long-term framework of 10% to 15% total shareholder return as measured by EPS growth plus dividend yield, we delivered a TSR of 14.2% for fiscal 2024, which is near the high-end of our target. And as I said, our teams are focused on controlling what they can control. One of the ways we do that is by having well-trained, tenured team members. Our manager and team member retention is at or above pre-COVID levels, and our teams are benefiting from this staffing consistency, which helps create great guest experiences. We also provide our teams with training programs that not only enhance their skill sets, but build on the unique culture of our brands. Further strengthening engagement. For example, LongHorn recently completed their seventh steak master series. Over the course of two months, 1,000s of culinary team members competed in this highly engaging grilling competition and training program for the Right to be Crown Champion and received the $15,000 grand prize. Congratulations to this year's champion, Jacob Montgomery from the LongHorn Steak House in Cape Coral, Florida. Beyond providing strong labor and cost management, our operators are ensuring their teams remain focused on being brilliant with the basics, which is driving record guest satisfaction. Several of our brands reach all new time highs for overall guest satisfaction for the full fiscal year, including Olive Garden, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Season's 52, and Bahama Breeze. Additionally, within the casual dining segment of technomics industry tracking tool, LongHorn ended the fiscal year ranked number one for food, service, atmosphere, and overall perceptions, as well as brand fit and loyalty. Now let me provide a final update on the integration of Ruth's Chris Steak House. During the quarter, we completed the transition of all company-owned restaurants onto both our proprietary point of sale and labor management systems, which were the final major changes for the restaurants. We also acquired a single franchise location in Destin, Florida during the quarter. Thanks to the hard work and collaboration between the Ruth's Chris team and our integration team, we closed on the acquisition and completed the integration during the same fiscal year. This included onboarding 5,000 new team members with no turnover among our nine directors of operations. We also achieved the expected synergies, resulting in EPS accretion of $0.10. Integration is not easy, and I'm particularly proud of the focus the restaurant teams maintained on the guest and team member experience throughout the process. Overall I'm pleased with our performance for the fiscal year. We successfully navigated a challenging environment and our proven strategy combined with the strength of our business ensures we are well positioned regardless of the operating environment. As we begin fiscal 2025, we remain focused on managing our business for the long-term by executing our strategy that drives growth and long-term shareholder value. We have also taken steps to further position Darden and our brands for future growth and success through several leadership changes. We are fortunate to have a deep bench of talent and these changes are designed to allow two of our most seasoned presidents to devote more time to developing our newest brand presidents. After nine years of leading LongHorn Steak House to record performance, Todd Burrowes has transitioned to a new role as President of Business Development. Todd now has responsibility for our new restaurant development and facilities team, our international and franchising business, and Ruth's Chris, our newest brand. Reporting to Todd are Mark Braun, Senior Vice President of Development; Brad Smith, President of International and Franchising; and Rick Jenkins, President of Ruth's Chris, who previously led operations for the brand. Todd is well suited to lead this work. He brings an operator's perspective to new restaurant development and our growing franchise business. Further, Todd was with LongHorn when we acquired Ruth's Hospitality 17-years ago, and he will be a valuable leader and resource for Rick as the Ruth's Chris team continues to acclimate to Darden. Todd's replacement at LongHorn is Laura Williamson. Laura is well respected across LongHorn, having served as their finance leader for nine years. She will report to me. We also named three new brand Presidents within our specialty restaurant group, who will report directly to John Martin, who continues to serve as President of the Specialty Restaurant Group. Bryan Clements, the Former Head of Operations at Olive Garden, is now President of Yard House. Falon Farrell, who led operations for Eddie V's, has been named President of the Capital Grill in Eddie V's. And Mark Cooper, who led finance for the Special Restaurant Group, is now President of Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze. I'm excited about these changes and confident we have the right leaders in place to drive future growth. I'm also proud that three of our seven brand presidents began their careers as hourly team members at our restaurants and the average tenure of all of our brand presidents is 27 years. Now I'll turn it over to Raj. Thanks, Raj. All of us at Darden continue to work together in pursuit of our higher purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve, our guests, team members, and communities. During the year, we had the privilege of serving 420 million guests, more than 1 million per day, providing great food and drinks with attentive service in an engaging atmosphere. We also promoted 1,100 hourly team members into our manager and training program and promoted nearly 300 managers to general manager or managing partner positions. And we continue to invest in our team members with programs like Fast Fluency, which provides the opportunity to learn English for free, and our next course scholarship program that, through the Darden Foundation, has awarded 200 scholarships worth $3,000 each over the past two years to children of our team members. We also remain committed to nourishing and delighting the communities we serve through our ongoing efforts to fight hunger. As part of our Harvest Food Donation Program, our restaurants donated 4.5 million meals to local food banks in fiscal 2024. We also continued our successful partnership with Feeding America with another $2 million donation from the Darden Foundation that helped provide mobile food trucks to 10 more Feeding America food banks, bringing the total to 45 trucks provided over the last four years. To wrap up, I want to thank our team members in our restaurants and our support center for their outstanding efforts throughout the year. Their disciplined approach in executing our strategy is what enables us to succeed, regardless of the operating environment. Now I will take your questions. Yes, Lauren. In regards to marketing, we've said in the past that we'd probably tick it up a couple of tenths a year and that's probably what we'll do in fiscal \u201825. But we're going to continue to focus in our marketing efforts on our filters, which we've talked about many times. And we're not going to do things to buy sales, even with the increasing discounting our competitors are doing. You know, our best way to drive sales is our focus on a back to basics operating philosophy and our guests telling others what a great value they have when they come to our restaurants. And just remember, we do have levers to pull. We do have more marketing to pull if we want to, but our focus is on profitable sales growth. Yes, Lauren. It is mostly at the income -- at the consumer below the median household income, which is about $75,000. Consumers are generally concerned about inflation, and they're becoming more concerned about the job market. And what we're seeing are some behavior shifts that we had already started to see. So for Q4, transactions from households below -- with incomes below the median were lower than last year. So -- and that's more pronounced with consumers below $50,000 in income. And these impacts were even greater in our fine dining brands. So that's why you saw fine dining had a little bit more negative comp than others. But at the same time, our guests aren't managing their check like we've seen in prior quarters. And so, you know, we continue to tell you what this means for our brands. Operators that deliver their brand promise and value will continue to appeal to consumers despite economic challenges, and that's what we're focused on doing. We're focusing on giving the consumers that are coming to our restaurants and spending their hard-earned money a great value and a great experience and have them tell others to come back. Hey, Andrew. Yes to all. Now, remember, Raj said we did exceed industry benchmarks. Olive Garden has taken much lower pricing than Darden over the year and the industries over the years. And we're really proud of their team. We're really proud of Dan and the team and what they've done. You know, they're going to continue to focus their marketing on their key equity of never-ending, craveable, abundant Italian food, specifically focusing on ensuring every guest is offered a refill with their first course. That's something that's not provided in other competitors. So that refill is a pretty big part of what we do and a big part of their value equation. But we're also going to continue to innovate over in our menu. What you see right now on television if you haven't is our Create Your Own pasta at $12.99. You know, consumers in more challenging times are looking for more price certainty, and that is an amazing value to create your own pasta at $12.99 with unlimited first course. And we'll continue to focus our marketing efforts there. And we have digital marketing that we can pull as well. So without getting into all the details, we do have levers to pull, but I want to remind everybody we're focused on profitable sales growth, not just buying sales to show a top line number. And we've been very consistent over the years with that. That profitable sales growth is what matters and Raj talked about our EBITDA growth over the last five years, how strong it was. And so we'll continue to focus there. Yes, let me start by saying the franchisees at Ruth's Chris are really valued partners to us. And our focus was on integrating our company on restaurants into Darden. You know, this one restaurant franchise was an opportunistic purchase. So, you know, we're going to continue as is and speak with our franchisees if they want to speak with us, but right now we're going to continue to focus on making sure our team gets acclimated to the systems that we've implemented. And so it's not necessarily a change in strategy. It was an opportunistic purchase for us. Yes, David and that's exactly what we're doing right now. You know, on TV right now, we've got our Create Your Own Pasta at $12.99 with the price point on the television. And, you know, we do believe that Olive Garden has a great everyday value. And so what we -- the things that we can do to continue to highlight that versus discounting is what we'll continue to do. Yes, Jim, The consumer is really focused on what price they're paying in everywhere, not just in restaurants. And if you think about the cost that they have on the non-discretionary costs, they've been growing faster than wages for quite a few years, and that eats into discretionary spending. So if inflation in the non-discretionary gets better, that may give them a little bit more discretionary. And if you're considering food at the grocery store or food a non-discretionary, then yes, that should help. But we'd like to see some lower inflation in things like things that people have to buy. Rent, utilities, child care, all of those things would help on the non-discretionary side, help discretionary spend. Hey, Sara. This is Rick. When we acquired Ruth's, we think about an acquisition over a long, long period of time. We're not as worried about the next quarter or the quarter after the acquisition. Now, would we have liked the consumer at the below-median income to continue to go to fine dining? Absolutely, but any time we make an acquisition, there could be a chance that it's because we're going into a slowdown and maybe there's a little bit of a better opportunity for price discovery there. So, I would never read into when we make an acquisition into a certain category or not. Remember, we have criteria for our M&A and Ruth's met every one of that criteria, and we were able to agree on our price. So that's why it happened at the time it happened. And generally, that's when any of our M&A will happen, as long as we find the brands that meet the criteria and we get price discovery and we agree on a price and we'll do that deal, we're not worried about the environment that we're going into or that we're coming out of because these are long, long-term investments for us. Sure, Jeff. I'm not going to talk about the trends into fiscal \u201825 where we are. And I think Raj had mentioned that the quarterly -- fourth quarter, we were pretty consistent month-over-month, month to month to month. So -- but I will say for Olive Garden, in prior slowdowns, Olive Garden outperformed. They outperformed at the same restaurant sales and at that time they were taking more pricing than everybody else. We outperformed this quarter in traffic and we've continued to outperform the industry in traffic for the last many years and we only took 1% pricing. What I would tell you is that if we would have taken the pricing that the industry took in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, I'm sorry, Olive Garden would have been positive and would have performed even more. And so this is a long game for us. The other thing that we aren't -- that we're not pulling are things that everybody or not everybody, but people used to pull in slowdowns, couponing, deep discounting and all those other things and we're not doing that even at a time that our competitors have ramped up discounting, deep discounting on television and, you know, Olive Garden still outperformed in traffic, didn't outperform in comp sales, but as I said, we only took 1% pricing. And so we're really, really proud of that and we'll continue to do that. And maybe that's why we didn't outperform on the sales side, but we did continue to outperform on the traffic side. And I just want to say their gap in fiscal Q4 was 60 basis points in traffic, and their two-year gap is 530 basis points in traffic. So we feel pretty good with where they are. Yes, David, I won't comment on how they're doing versus their competition, but I can tell you as Olive Garden, both internally and externally, their value ratings have increased over this last year. And they're pretty close to the top end of the value and overall in the measures we look at. I also mentioned they were kind of at the highest levels of guest satisfaction in this fiscal year. But again, they continue in all of our brands. Most of our brands -- I think all of our brands were at or above their value perceptions externally versus last year? Well, there may be interaction trade down to at-home because of the median income consumer, it's not necessarily the Italian. But I can tell you where we compete in the full service base, Olive Garden was at 75th percentile in their traffic. So -- and again, when you're comparing how they're doing in full service. And then we're putting in this at-home, everybody is dealing with the at-home as well, not just Italian. And then finally, the competitors had ramped up very deep discounting and while we had -- we didn't see that actually impacting Olive Garden or our other brands, because the trends kind of stayed similar. What we did see, interestingly, is a little bit of a shift from QSR to some of those competitors. And so that might be where they're trying to take some share from. But we did see that and that lifted the industry index in some of those -- and maybe one of those competitors, which is a big part of the index. So there's a little bit of a nuance in how the index works, especially when you're taking share from another category -- another part of the index. Yes, Dennis. I will -- let me start by saying that the new restaurant projection we have for next year is within our long-term framework. So while it's lower than we like it to be, it's still within our long-term framework. And recall, the new restaurants also include M&A. So we bought about 80 restaurants from Ruth's Chris that were part of last year. Now that's not impacting this year, but it is part of our framework construction costs are still quite a bit higher than they were before COVID, but the levels are normalizing more and it's still taking a little longer to get construction starts. We're just trying to figure out ways to improve our process to potentially get starts moving a little bit faster. And maybe there is some things that we can do to help municipalities with kind of working on permitting and other things, But we feel pretty good about our pipeline for next year. We'd like to see it higher for the years after, but we're not going to just build restaurants and put a number out there that we don't think that we can hit, and we feel pretty good about where we are. And again, Raj showed you where we were for the last five years in our new unit growth. It was almost 3%. It was 2.9%, which is at the high-end of our framework. So we don't necessarily think year-to-year, we think long-term. Yes, Dennis, I think my perspective is -- we like what we're doing better, right? We don't think that we think that everyday low value and continue to focus on our core equities is more sustainable than deep discounting to try to drive people in. Others can do that, and we'll continue to play this long game. And over time, you have to keep wrapping on that. If you do a deep discount and it stays the same way, you have to do even more the next year, you have to do more television. And we just think we'd rather do more great food, more great service, and let's wrap that. And so again, I can't comment on what other people think is sustainable or not. We just think our business, the way we do it is more sustainable. Yes, John. For several years, we've been building our internal digital media capabilities, and we've done -- Olive Garden is the only one on television. Everybody else does spend marketing and it's in digital. And we've been testing things like connected television. We've been testing other things to help drive our traffic. And because we've been testing this allows us to kind of move them into other brands to see how they work. We do a lot of test and learn -- and so we don't expect our media to grow significantly year-over-year because we think we're more efficient with the tests that we do. And so as we continue to do that, we know what the right times to put messages out there. We know what days and we knew all those things. So we're not necessarily going to think about ramping up a communication of a certain day part unless the brand thinks it's the right thing to do. And so they might -- we might see some brands talk about a certain day part or not. But we are using our digital that we've learned over the years and we have an internal team here that's great at what they do and we'll continue to focus on that. Yes, Chris, I think not just at Olive Garden, but all our brands can do more to improve throughput in our peak periods. We can get a little bit quicker in what we do to make sure that the guest doesn't feel rush, but they don't feel like they're waiting for a lot of things. So we do think that there's opportunities and not just at Olive Garden, and if we can do that better, we should get some -- at least some traffic in that day if people were walking away. But in the long run, getting a little bit quicker, maybe better for us any day, not just on the peak periods. Yes, Danilo, as I said in the prepared remarks, these changes help set us up for future growth and developing our leaders. So if you think about Todd and John elevating their roles a little bit, Todd leading development, international and franchising and Ruth's Chris. And those all have really good synergies for Todd, right? So development in new restaurants, that's for all brands but international franchising with the percent of restaurants that Ruth's Chris has his franchise, it's actually a pretty good synergy there. Plus, as I said, Todd, came with -- came to us from rare hospitality when we bought them. So he knows what it's like after the systems integration and how to help people assimilate more. And he'll help Rick, who's our new President, become a great President. And then finally, as I mentioned, having an operator's perspective and new restaurant development, I think, is a pretty good thing to do. We think about how to do the turnovers better how to get -- make sure we are more planful in telling the brands when we think the restaurant is going to open. So there aren't moves and delays, so we can get those a little bit better. So that's really where Todd comes into play. And then on John's side, if you think about the specialty restaurant group with five brands and John leading all five, that was a lot. And so how do we help bring him up and bring the new president underneath John, who are all proven leaders and all have a good future here with us, while John can help them become even better brand presidents. A couple of them -- one of them is a former finance person, but he's got a great operations knowledge, and he actually was a restaurant manager many, many years ago. But John can help Mark become a better general manager and think more about operations. You've got Falon Farrell, who's now going to be leading Capital Grille and Eddie V's. Actually, Falon started at Capital Grille as a team member, and she worked at Capital Grille for many years. And then she led training for Capital Grille, and Eddie V's. And now she -- then she led Eddie V's for quite a while in operation. So she can see how do we bring some synergies in the support center for Capital Grille and Eddie V's to help leverage those brands better, but while working for John who can continue to develop her for the future. And then I think about Bryan Clements. Bryan, his history, he started a big bar brands years ago. He spent many years at LongHorn to understand how LongHorn and a simple operating model works and he spent time at Olive Garden, leading Olive Garden operations, and that's a big system. And how do you think about a big system when you've got Yard House who's passing 80 restaurants, and we want to continue to grow them, and he can help with more system thinking at Yard House. So we think it's a really great move for all of them. And Laura, I didn't mention Laura is a great leader here at Darden. And she spent nine years at LongHorn. She really knows LongHorn. And she's got a great relationship with Todd. She'll be able to continue to talk to Todd and the team at LongHorn has rallied around her. So our reasoning behind that is to get people ready, while other people are basically retirement eligible. And so we want to make sure that they're here to help them progress. And you know what our retirement programs are not saying that anybody is leaving anytime soon, but this gives them a chance to develop people while they're still around. Hey Jake, this is Rick. I'm going to start on the fact act with saying that our employment proposition is great in California. So we've got a great one there. On average, our team members earn well over $20 an hour. And California only represents about 5% of our restaurants. So it's not like it's an over-index for us. We haven't seen a real impact in wages. And since the FAST Act came about, but unfortunately, we have seen many closures of fast food restaurants in that time. And so our California performance for the quarter was still not as strong as the company, as you said. But as Raj said, we did see some softness in California, but I think that was more related to some weather there than anything else. But again, we haven't seen a whole lot of change in our wages. Our employment proposition is great in California. But we have seen some fast food restaurants, unfortunately, have to close because of the act. Greg, let me start by saying every time we come up with a target for Olive Garden, we blow past it. So we haven't really talked about a target for Olive Garden for a lot of years. What we have found over the last five or 10 years is that we can open more Olive Gardens in markets that Olive Gardens are already in, where prior to that, we weren't doing that as much. Convenience is important to consumers, and we'd rather be a little closer where they live. And so we do believe there's opportunities to open Olive Gardens for the foreseeable future, and we don't think we're near the top of the Olive Garden limit yet. Greg, did you have any other questions? Thank you so much."

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin, Kevin.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during the call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2024 fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, June 20, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. During today's call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing third quarter performance is a comparison to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence, casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. During our fiscal third quarter, industry same-restaurant sales decreased 4.2% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 6.5%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter, and Raj will provide details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our results this quarter. Each one of our segments grew total sales and profit in an operating environment that was tougher than we anticipated. We continued to outperform the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic. Total sales were $3 billion, an increase of 6.8%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $2.62, which was in line with our expectations. We opened 16 restaurants during this quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, we have opened 43 restaurants in 22 states, seven of which were reopenings. The quarter started well with strong holiday performance in December, but unfavorable winter weather negatively impacted January traffic. And while February results improved, we experienced some underlying softness we had not seen in the months leading up to January. The lower income consumer does appear to be pulling back, and the mix of guests based on income is now in line with pre-COVID. I am proud that even as industry traffic trends weakened, we were able to gain share. We continue to focus on controlling what we can control, leveraging and strengthening our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented culture, and executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service, and atmosphere. Our restaurant teams continue to perform at their best, especially during our busiest times. In December, the Capital Grille set their all-time total monthly sales record. In February, Eddie V\u2019s set their all-time total weekly sales record, and Olive Garden established a new sales record for Valentine's Day. Our internal guest satisfaction metrics reflect our team's focus on being brilliant with the basics. All of our brands remained at or near all-time highs for overall guest satisfaction during the quarter. Additionally, within the casual dining, polished casual and fine dining segments of Technomic's industry tracking tool, the Darden brand was ranked number one for overall experience. The brands were LongHorn Steakhouse, Seasons 52, and Ruth's Chris Steak House. Our team's ability to execute at a high level is driven by strong leadership and team member engagement across our brands. We work hard to ensure our results-oriented culture is a competitive advantage for us, and our industry-leading retention rates confirm it is in an area of strength. During the quarter, we completed our biannual engagement survey, and a result showed that our overall level of engagement is at an all-time high. Also, during the quarter, three of our brands were recognized as industry leaders in Black Box Intelligence, LongHorn, the Capital Grille, and Seasons 52 each received the Employer of Choice Award. Now let me provide a quick update on Ruth Chris. We are in the final stage of integration and remain on track to complete the major changes by the end of the fiscal year. We successfully completed the migration onto our HR platform at the end of December, and all restaurants have now successfully transitioned to our distribution network. Currently, we are halfway through converting the restaurants over to our point of sale system, and we are on track to complete that work by the end of May. This is the most challenging part of integration, and I'm really proud of the focus the Ruth\u2019s Chris team continues to have on delivering exceptional guest experiences. This can be seen in the fact that Ruth's Chris was named America's favorite chain restaurant in Technomic's annual survey that was released during the quarter. The survey measures perceptions of service and hospitality, unit appearance and ambiance, food and beverage, convenience and value. In addition to Ruth's Chris, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, LongHorn and the Capital Grille were all ranked in the top 10. Overall, I am pleased with our performance this quarter. We continue to manage the business for the long-term by executing against our strategy and controlling what we can control. We also continue to work in pursuit of our shared purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. One of the ways we do this is for our team members and their families is through our Next Course Scholarship program. Earlier this month the Darden Foundation awarded more than 100 post-secondary education scholarships worth $3,000 each to children of Darden team members. Education is one of the greatest equalizers in our country, and I'm thrilled that we can create a lasting impact on the lives of our team members' families through this program. Finally, I want to thank our 190,000 team members for everything you do to create exceptional experiences for our guests. You are the reason brands continue to be recognized as great places to work and top dining destinations. Now, I will turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, although our sales were softer than we anticipated. We were pleased with December's strong holiday performance as the month's same-restaurant sales were in line with our second quarter results. However, winter weather in January negatively impacted traffic results by approximately 100 basis points for the quarter. As we moved into February, sales trends improved, but were below our expectations, exposing some underlying consumer weakness. Despite the unexpected variability in our sales trends, our teams did a great job managing their businesses. In the third quarter, we generated $3 billion of total sales, 6.8% higher than last year, driven by the acquisition of Ruth's Chris Steak House and 55 net new restaurants, which was partially offset by negative same-restaurant sales of 1%. We outperformed the industry again this quarter with same-restaurant sales that were 320 basis points better than the industry and same-restaurant guest counts that were 270 basis points better. And on a two-year basis, we have outperformed on same-restaurant sales by 770 basis points and by 970 basis points on same-restaurant guest counts. Our focus on managing the business and controlling costs resulted in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.62 in the quarter, an increase of 12% from last year's reported earnings per share. We generated $512 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $190 million of capital to our shareholders through $157 million in dividends and $33 million of share repurchases. Now looking at our adjusted margin analysis, compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 90 basis points better, driven by pricing leverage. Total commodities inflation of approximately 1.5% was below our total pricing of approximately 3.5%. Restaurant labor was 10 basis points unfavorable to last year due to total labor inflation of approximately 4.5%, partially offset by pricing and productivity improvements at our brand. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points higher as sales deal average was partially offset by strong cost management by our teams. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our expectations. All of this resulted in restaurant-level EBITDA of 20.6%, 70 basis points better than last year. G&A as a percent of sales was 40 basis points lower than last year, and total expense was slightly favorable to our previous guidance related to lower incentive compensation and ongoing synergies from the integration of Ruth's Chris. Interest expense increased 50 basis points versus last year, due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth's Chris acquisition. And for the quarter, adjusted earnings from continuing operations was 10.6% of sales, 30 basis points better than last year. Looking at our segments, Olive Garden increased total sales by 0.7%, driven by new restaurant growth, partially offset by negative same-restaurant sales of 1.8%. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales outperformed the industry benchmark by 240 basis points, and their traffic outperformed the industry by 270 basis points. Despite the negative same-restaurant sales, Olive Garden segment profit margin of 22.5% was flat to last year. At LongHorn, total sales increased 5.1%, driven by new restaurant growth and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.3%. LongHorn same-restaurant sales outperformed the industry by 650 basis points. Segment profit margin of 18.7% was 130 basis points above last year, driven by pricing leverage and improved labor productivity. Total sales at fine dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants. Same-restaurant sales at both Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s were negative as the fine dining category continued to be challenged year-over-year. Fine dining segment profit margin was flat year-over-year at 21.8%. The other business segment sales increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris franchise and managed location revenue, but was partially offset by combined negative same-restaurant sales of 2.6% for the brands in the other segment. However, this was still 160 basis points above the industry benchmark. Segment profit margin of 14.9% was 90 basis points better than last year, driven by the additional royalty revenues and higher overall pricing relative to inflation. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024, we have updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of approximately $11.4 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 1.5% to 2%, 50 to 55 new restaurants, capital spending of approximately $600 million, total inflation of approximately 3%, including commodities inflation of approximately 1.5%, an annual effective tax rate of 12% to 12.5%, and approximately 121 million diluted average share outstanding for the year. This results in an increased or adjusted diluted net earnings per share outlook of $8.80 to $8.90, which excludes approximately $55 million of pre-tax transaction and integration related costs. For the fourth quarter specifically, our annual outlook implies sales of $2.95 billion to $2.99 billion, same-restaurant sales between negative 0.5% and positive 1%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share between $2.58 and $2.68. Now looking forward into fiscal 2025, we plan on opening between 45 and 50 new restaurants and spending between $250 million and $300 million of capital for those new restaurants. Additionally, we anticipate approximately $300 million of capital spending related to ongoing restaurant maintenance, refresh, and technology. And finally, we anticipated effective tax rate of approximately 13% for fiscal 2025. And now I'd like to close by saying that we continue to be very proud of how our teams are managing their businesses to deliver strong results in this dynamic environment. With that, we'll open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe if you could unpack the comments about the low-income consumer pulling back? And maybe specifically talking about what behaviors you're seeing that lead you to that conclusion? And how the brands are differing from all of Darden Cheddar\u2019s to maybe some of the higher-end brands, how that low-income consumer is changing their usage of those brands? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Eric. We're clearly seeing consumer behavior shifts. Our data shows we're essentially back to our normal pre-COVID mix across all income groups. But specifically your question, for the third quarter, transactions from households with incomes above $150,000 were higher than last year. Transactions from incomes below $75,000 were much lower than last year. And at every brand, transactions fell from incomes below $50,000. Similar to Q2, this shift was most pronounced in our fine dining segment.\nEric Gonzalez: Great. And then may be just a follow-up, if you could just talk about from a margin perspective, this year has been pretty strong. I'm wondering if you could maybe tease out how much that margin improvement is related to commodities versus what you've achieved from a productivity perspective? And if you look to next year, do you see that being a year of additional productivity gains or is some of that pulled forward into this year?\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Eric. This is Raj. So, from a margin perspective, if you look at where -- what we talked about at the beginning of the year, we -- this was one of the years where we had a pricing a little bit above inflation going into the fiscal year. But as the year progressed, inflation came down -- inflation came in better than we expected for both commodities and labor. And then that combined with our team's strong cost management that improved productivity on the labor front. We also improved our waste. We had some favorability on the mix in terms of how the trading happened between the items. So all of these were contributors to our margin improvement versus our plan. Now, as we look at next year, we'll share more details in June, but the way we look at as we're going through the planning process right now, but we\u2019ll always use our long-term framework as a guidepost to inform how we think of our plan. So we'll share more details in June. And -- but we have -- if you look back over the last four years, we were underpriced a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nBrian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the lowering consumer and your comments about this cohort pulling back because it was a pretty pronounced commentary there. I know you talked to Eric's question about what you're seeing, but I think this is reflected in your 4Q same-store sales outlook? But do you anticipate this dynamic that you're seeing with the low-end consumer to be powerful enough to impact industry sales throughout the rest of the calendar year? And if so, how are you thinking about updating your strategy to deal with this?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Brian. Yes, we can't determine whether it's going to be impacting the rest of the year. What we can say -- what I can say is that impact to the low-end consumer was a year-over-year phenomenon. And now we're back to our pre-COVID mix. And so if you think about where we were before COVID, what percent of our guests were below 50,000, what percent of our below 75%, et cetera, across all of our segments, all of our brands, it's almost exactly the same as it was before COVID. So at least that makes us feel like we know how to operate in this environment. The other thing is if you look at Black Box, according to Black Box, every segment in the industry, from QSR and up was negative in same-restaurant traffic in our third quarter, every one of them. So that's also a year-over-year phenomenon. And so we'll continue to monitor what we see with the guest and what we see on that lower end consumer. But we're pleased that it's back to our normal or normal pre-COVID levels. And in respect to marketing, as we've talked about often, we're focused on profitable sales growth. And our brands, all of our segments improved sales and profits for the quarter year-over-year. And we, even with the increase in competitive activity, we expected -- we exceeded, I'm sorry, industry traffic by 270 basis points on top of the 700 basis point gap we had in Q3 last year, so almost 1,000 points, so 970-point gap in two years. So we're going to stick to our strategy of everyday value to our guests and continue to use our filters to evaluate any marketing activity. If that means that we're going to spend a little bit more in a quarter or a little bit less in a quarter, that's what we'll do. But we're going to focus on our strategy and stick to it as long as we can. Thanks.\nBrian Bittner: And just as my follow-up, as it relates to the third quarter specifically, your ability to manage the margins was very impressive despite where the comps shook out. Can you just talk a little more specifically about how you nimbly manage that labor and other operating expense line? And just, Raj, as we look to 4Q, I think you had previously said you expect to underprice inflation by about 150 to 200 basis points in the fourth quarter? Is that still kind of the range you want us thinking about pricing versus inflation for 4Q? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Brian, I'll start with how we manage labor and productivity, and then I'll let Raj answer the question on the pricing. So if you think about what we've been doing over the years, we've been improving our technology on guest count forecasting by using machine learning and AI tools to help the brands write better schedules and manage their business better and we're able to react quicker to impacts that we see in our restaurants, but we're also continuing to find ways to improve productivity. And one of the ways and the benefit that we had this quarter is continued improvement in turnover. And so we've had less training expense for new team members. And we've got better retention, team members know how to do their job better. In the turnover ranks, where we are today across Darden, our turnover went down by about 20 basis point -- 20 percentage points versus last year and almost 30 percentage points better than the industry. And now our turnover is much closer to pre-COVID levels, except for Yard House and Cheddar's, which actually we believe are at a level lower than they've ever had in their history. So those things help with labor and food costs and other parts of the P&L. And I'll let Raj answer the other part about inflation.\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Brian, for Q4, we're still expecting that gap to be in the 100 to 150. So overall inflation is expected to be in the mid-3s for us and the pricing is probably going to be in the 2 to 2.5. So we still expect underprice inflation by -- in that range of 100 to 150 in Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDennis Geiger: Great, thanks guys. Wondering if you could speak to what you're seeing from a customer average check standpoint? Anything with respect to alcohol or other mix contributions that you saw in the quarter or that have changed relative to prior quarters?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. We're actually -- for the check for the third quarter, we actually saw the mix moderate the levels we saw -- in terms of what we saw in Q2. So if you look at our casual brands, the negative mix was around 40 basis points. In Q2, it was closer to 60 basis points. And then from the Fine Dining, we saw a huge improvement. I think Fine Dining in the second quarter was north of 200 basis points negative mix. We're now seeing in the low 100 basis points negative mix. So that's almost half. So we are seeing some improvement in terms of check mix. And part of that could be a wrap, but also the holidays were pretty strong. And so that -- on that front, we're actually seeing a positive momentum, I guess, quarter-to-quarter.\nDennis Geiger: That\u2019s great. Thanks, just one other quick one. Just as it relates to off-premise, anything to call out there in the quarter? What you're seeing, how your strategy has been effective despite some of the consumer pressures out there on the off-premise side of things? Thanks, guys.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. From an off-premise perspective, our sales as a percent of sales was slightly below last year, but not a lot. This is typically a high season for Olive Garden off-premise. So Q3 was closer to 26%. Last year was also in that range. We were probably 40, 50 basis points lower, but not a lot. And LongHorn was around 13%, which was also about 40 or 30 basis points lower. But overall, I think it goes back to the execution. Our focus has been staying on just ensuring that we executed the highest levels for off-premise, and that's helped contribute to maintaining the stability.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jon Tower from Citigroup. Your line is now live.\nJon Tower: Great, thanks, I appreciate that. I guess the first one is -- and I understand you, guys, want to stay true to the operating philosophy. But how do you keep your brands top of mind and visible in front of consumers when the industry is getting more aggressive with getting in front of them by spending a lot more dollars than they have in the past several years on marketing?\nRick Cardenas: Hey Jon, if you think about the amount we spend, even with the spending that we had this quarter, Olive Garden in most of the weeks were in the top three in share of voice. And so we're still in front of our consumer. We have other ways to get in front of the consumer with our eClub and with other digital spend. But at the end of the day, the best way to get people to come into our restaurants is to have guests recommend us to others. And so that's what we're continuing to focus on. We will continue to use marketing with our filters to talk about our core equities and to continue to drive results in the long-term. And we do have great everyday value. And what -- as we think about what we want to do in the future, I don't want to get into the details, but we have levers to pull. And if we pull them, you'll know after we pull them.\nJon Tower: Okay. I appreciate that. And then just on the '25 outlook for the unit growth, I was surprised it was lower than at least this year from a gross opening or a planned opening perspective. Can you speak to why as of right now, you're expecting kind of 45 to 50 versus what we've been seeing in the past several years?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Jon, you said it, the new restaurant projection we have for next year, it is within our long-term framework but it's lower than we'd like it to be. We're going to keep working on getting to the high end of that framework over time, but it will take a little bit of time. I would say construction costs were quite a bit higher than pre-COVID levels. And we have walked away from some deals, because of the construction costs and they've come back to us after we walked away. And so we're willing to slow it down a little bit to get a better result in the long-term. And -- but the good news is, at least the construction cost has stabilized. The other thing is it's still taking longer to get construction starts than it was four years ago. It's also taking longer to get to completion than it was in the past. And so if you think of it at that time it will take to build a restaurant, it's longer than it was. A lot of that is driven by developers, utilities, hookups and time for permitting and also time for getting certificates of occupancy. So if you think about the time that we have openings, we've got a lot of our openings next year towards the end, which could slip. And that's what we just wanted to make sure that we get the number -- that we tell you a number that we're going to hit. But we want to get closer to that high end over the long-term. And the other thing is I want everybody to remember we do include M&A as part of those new restaurants. And we didn't talk about that, but Ruth's Chris, we added 77 restaurants this year. So it gave us a little bit of a relief valve to not be so aggressive if we didn't need to be aggressive.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from David Tarantino from Baird. Your line is now live.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. I want to come back to the question of how you would manage the business if the environment were to get worse from here? And in particular, you mentioned you had some levers to pull on. I know you don't want to share details around that, but I was wondering if you could just comment on whether anything would change if things got worse? And then specifically on the pricing question, just wondering your pricing philosophy in the current environment and whether you will continue to be conservative relative to your inflation levels?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, David, as we think about the levers we can pull, we have -- as we've talked over the years, we brought our marketing down. We've actually focused more on our core equities. And every year, we might take marketing up a little bit, but we're not going to strategic -- we're not going to change our strategy. We're not going to become a discount kind of heavily promotional brand. We worked really hard through COVID and before to get to what we think is a better, stable, stronger business for us for the long-term. And we would be willing to deal with short-term pressures to not change our strategy to get to the long-term. Now again, we have some tactics that we can do, which would still stick to our strategy, but we're not going to -- we don't plan on getting to be a promotional deep discounting brand. Again, Olive Garden, which had less marketing in Q3 than it did in Q2, while they had less marketing than last year and in the second quarter, our competitors had more, Olive Garden still gained share. And that's what our focus is, is to share gain, sales and profit growth over the time. We're going to continue to focus on execution, our food, our service and our atmosphere to increase frequency with our core guests. And we love our core guests. We think they're great for us, and we'll continue to build over time. We're just not going to fight gravity on what's going on in the environment. We're going to stick to what we want to do. And then on the pricing side, we -- our strategy is to continue to price below inflation over time. And we've taken a lot less pricing than the competitive set. We've taken a lot less pricing than CPI, a lot less pricing than full service, limited service over the last four years. So it gives us some room to continue to price if we need to. But our still -- our plan is still over the long term to price below inflation.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. It makes sense.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great, thank you. My first question, Rick, you mentioned the operating environment tougher than anticipated. Just wondering how would you size up? How much of that is the broader macro versus maybe whether you'd say there were any internal missteps? I mean, I'm assuming your data is showing that the broader industry pullback was not just Darden in February that you're seeing, the broader industry see the very same directional trend in February. Is that fair to say? Any thoughts there would be great.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Jeff, I think it's a broader market versus any specific missteps we had. Our gap increased from January to February, our traffic and sales gap increased, both of those increased between January and February. And as I said, every category in the industry from QSR and up had negative traffic in the quarter. And so I think there's a little bit of a bigger challenge, at least a year-over-year challenge for our consumer. And we're going to see how that plays out over the next couple of quarters and see if there's anything we need to change, but it won't be a dramatic change.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then just to follow-up the February, it sounds like you said it improved, but below plan. Did that underlying consumer weakness persist into March? I mean I know we're talking about short periods, but February is a short period and now we're pretty far into March. I'm just wondering whether you've seen any change for the better or the worse? And just curious from your perspective because you do have, I believe, up to nine brands now. What do you think drove that change in behavior? Is there anything in particular you're seeing? Because it does seem like January was weather, but then it really was just February and potentially into March. So I'm just wondering what your perspective is in terms of what drove that pullback? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. I would say, first of all, our guidance contemplates everything we know about March. I don't want to get into March. We have a lot of challenges forecasting three weeks in the month, when you've got spring break shifts and those kind of things happen. And so we're going to continue to watch. I think I've read a little bit on tax returns being a little bit delayed. But we're not going to read too much into that. Our -- we improved our gap between January and February. And so that's what we feel good about. We're not going to talk about March yet.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Jeff Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now live.\nJeff Farmer: Great. Thanks. Just following up on Jeff's question there. So again, you had made some reference to the lower income consumer, but in terms of thinking about just maybe a little bit softer trends than you had expected. How much of that would you put at the feet of the lower income consumer as opposed to the balance of potential drivers?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, I would say that if you think about our results being a little bit softer than we thought, I would put it more at the feet at the lower end and the higher end. Our higher-end consumer was up versus last year. So that would tell you that it was really more on the lower end consumer. But as I think about what the consumer trends are, I just want to remind everybody that we believe that operators that can deliver on their brand promise with value can continue to appeal consumers despite economic challenges. And that's what we're going to continue to focus on doing. I remain confident that we're well positioned and prepared for whatever we have to deal with. Thanks to the breadth of those nine brands that Jeff talked about, the strategic decision we made to price well below inflation and CPI over the last four years and those outstanding team members we have in our restaurants who are committed to create exceptional guest experiences for our guests. And so yes, the lower end consumer probably drove a little bit more of our miss to what we thought when we talked to you before, but we're going to continue to focus on what we do and take care of every guest that walks in the door at the best that we can to have them to come back.\nJeffrey Farmer: And then the second question, you just touched on, you gave me a pretty good segue there. But in terms of your more conservative pricing strategy relative to your peers, from what you've seen, has that driven traffic outperformance, market share outperformance? Is that strategy actually pay dividends to these customers, casual dining customers, appreciate that the Darden brand portfolio is actually a better price value than a lot of other concepts from what you've seen?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Jeff. I think if you look at our gap over two years, our gap to the industry, as I said, being almost 1,000 basis points -- I'm sorry, yes, 10% gap over the three years. It's been strong. And that's what we do. We're taking this price below inflation, having a great everyday value. And we think over the long term, that continues to build the value differential we have. We've got value leaders across and that helps build the traffic gap.\nJeffrey Farmer: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about industry capacity, particularly given what you're talking about with more challenged kind of traffic backdrop. And I think initially, during COVID, Darden talked about maybe a 10% decline in locations because of closures. And it feels like from a lot of the public companies we hear from, there's a desire to accelerate unit growth or has been. And I'm not exactly sure what's going on, on the independent side. So I guess I'm just curious, if you have a sense where capacity is now versus that 10% reduction? Are you seeing it come back in any of your markets or any specific regions? And maybe if you could touch on the independent side as well? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Andrew, I think we're still in that ballpark of 10%-plus. But if you actually look at the last year or so, there have been more closures than openings from the data we've seen. So net, there's net closings even in the last nine, 12 months data that we're looking at. When you think about the environment today, with all the regulation around where things are, it's very hard for someone to open a new restaurant. The financing costs have gone up. There is less developments happening, that's actually part of the reason we talked about some growth being constrained a little bit in the near term for us on the unit opening. So we would say it's not that different. It has not gotten much better. Maybe let's put it that way.\nAndrew Strelzik: Okay, great. And then maybe on your unit growth, expectations for next year. Just curious where we should expect a few openings to come from, I guess, does it just match based on the size of the portfolio or any of the brands in particular? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. I would say, assume that two-thirds of the growth is going to be coming from Olive Garden and LongHorn combined, and then the rest is -- one-third is from all the other brands. I don't know that we would say there's a huge difference year-over-year. It's a little bit of a change. But as we look forward, as Rick said, we'll continue to try to get that ramped up further.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. I remember in past periods, there were a number of things that you've done that aren't necessarily operationally difficult, and I don't think overly discounts the brands, things like dinners for two, buy one take one, maybe even highly targeted couponing to certain lower income consumers to bring them back. Those types of things did prove effective to the Darden of the past. I mean, I wonder if ideas like that are on the table? It's the first part of the question. And secondly, a lot of the higher income consumer, obviously, as you're getting more price resistant about some of the restaurants that they visit, is there a way to invite some of the higher income consumer maybe through different types of promotions back in Olive Garden as well that you haven't been doing in the past couple of years? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, John. Yes, that was -- the deep discounting, couponing, a lot of promotions was kind of a Darden pre-COVID. This is the Darden post-COVID, which is when we're talking about marketing, being things that elevate brand equity that are easy to execute and they're not at a deep discount. It doesn't mean that we won't have price points on things over time, but that's kind of more of our everyday low price or around that price. You think about Never Ending Pasta Bowl, we ran that this year at $13.99. It was a great promotion for us. And that was at $13.99. So we can think about doing those things again next year with Never Ending Pasta Bowl. We already have buy one take one on our menu basically, with the $6 take homes. So there's a lot of everyday value already. In terms of kind of talking to the higher-end consumer, as I mentioned, we actually grew at the higher end consumer at all of our segments. The 200,000-plus, 150-plus was up year-over-year. But I think you could see a little -- a few signs of some consumers trading down within our brands. When you think about LongHorn did really well with -- as they grew even at a little bit -- at the high-end consumer at a little bit lower, the 150, 125, and they had actually positive check. And so we're seeing some of that shift in some ways. And so we think as long as we execute great and we have great word of mouth, that will get that higher-end consumer maybe to trade to one of our brands from someone else, even if it trades from one of our current brands to one of our brands, that's fine with us, too. But again, long-term, every day, talk about what our core equities are, execute better than the restaurant next door, and we'll win, and we'll deal with short-term challenges.\nJohn Ivankoe: And is the company discussing kind of reintroducing or at least thinking about a more effective way to approach loyalty? I mean, is that something that becomes table stakes in '24 and '25 or are we happy with the current approach?\nRick Cardenas: We're happy with the current approach. If you think about loyalty and full-service restaurants, frequency isn't super high. And we've learned that when we did loyalty before. And so it's a little bit less valuable for a consumer, we believe. Now there's other ways to get that data. The value of loyalty is the data that you get, and we have other ways to grab that data. Doesn't mean that we won't think about loyalty in the future. We're just focusing on what we can do right now to continue to execute better to drive results and not to drive something that's just buying sales, because we'll have to keep buying it next year and the year after that. We don't want to go out and buy sales. We want to go out and earn those sales.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Great, thank you. So first of all, it appears the LongHorn, whether these challenges of this tough operating environment better than other brands. So I'm wondering what cost and what learnings could be applied to the other brands?\nRaj Vennam: So Danilo, I think as we talked about in the past, there's a lot of things, right? First of all, let's start with the big picture. We've talked about how, in general, Steak does a little bit better when beef prices are higher just because of the relative gap between the consumer would rather not take risk on cooking something that's expensive. So let's start with that big picture. With that said, within the steak category, not everybody is winning. So if you look at LongHorn, our performance has been driven by our execution. We talk about the simple operations, quality, investments in quality. So our team, Todd and the team have done a great job over the last four years, invest -- continuing to invest in the food and in service. And so if you look at it overall, you get a better value today than you ever did. So if you look at their pricing, it has been a lot lower in the industry versus the industry and especially for the Steak House, their pricing has been much lower than the competition. So the value equation is much better and a great execution. Really, those are the two things.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Great, thank you, Raj. And I want to follow-up on one of the comments that Rick was just making on, the level of attraction of your customers over the long period of time. And I wonder if you can provide some update on your customer trends with regards to the frequency at which they are spending in your brand? And maybe if you can offer also some insight on the size of your eClub member say versus the past and the total addressable market that you have? So how many customers you're seeing on a monthly basis at any of your brands?\nRick Cardenas: Well, let me start by saying, I think we serve about 100 -- about 1 million guests a day. across all of our brands, or more than that actually. And so we get a lot of people coming in. Our frequency hasn't dramatically changed over the last year. And our eClub is roughly between 25 million and 30 million guests, that's active eClub. We have more members, but they're active. And so we have ways to communicate with that and that's across all of our brands. And so we're really confident now that we've got our, as I said earlier, on the income demographic back to where we were pre-COVID, we know how to operate in that environment. We're seeing some shifts at the above 65-years old, and we've talked about that before. They're shifting a little bit more to lunch a little bit earlier to dine, and that's great. But so those are the only real major shifts we've seen.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nSara Senatore: Great. Thank you very much. Just a couple of clarifications, please. The first is in terms of the gap in the industry. I know you mentioned that it widened from January to February. But I was curious if -- it's also been -- have been widening before that from the fiscal 2Q to 3Q? I think historically, the gap has tended to widen when trends, industry gets tougher because of that sort of more selective consumer but I wanted to see if that was the case, kind of stepping back? And then the other question I have is, obviously, gotten a lot of questions about the low income. I wanted to understand how perhaps this normalization will serve as a headwind in the coming quarters? So for example, you're back at the pre-COVID levels now. Does that continue to be a bit of a headwind for the next three quarters until you lap this quarter? And are you thinking about offsets in the form of better mix? So perhaps that normalization continues to show up from a traffic perspective, but by the same token, less of a mix headwind. Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Okay. Let's start with the gap itself. So if you look at the gap in January, the gap narrowed a bit, we think primarily because of the geography and the footprint we have that has disproportionately impacted by weather. If you look at the concentration of where the weather was, that was a higher concentration of our restaurants. And we think that's part of the reason the gap was not as strong. Now the other part of this gap narrowing this quarter related to the last quarter was the fact that we're wrapping on huge gap from a year ago. We had a very strong performance a year ago. So that's really how we would kind of frame that. We're not -- look, we've been clear that it's very hard to maintain multiple hundreds of basis points of gap forever. We're going to have that narrow over time. But things we've done with our pricing and our value equation have helped us continue to take share, and we're happy with that. And as Rick said earlier, in an environment when there was intensity -- in promotional intensity, more so than ever, we still outperformed, and we were able to gain share. So that's the piece on the industry. Now as you look at the income mix, yes, we -- so this has been an ongoing shift. So we've talked about in Q2 that we're starting to see a shift a little bit more towards the pre-COVID mix. So we are -- so as we wrap -- as we looked at Q4 now, Q3 that just ended, we were right essentially where we were before COVID. So yes, the next three quarters, there's a little bit of moderation of getting that, but it's not as big as it was this quarter. If you think about -- we don't think. I mean we'll have to see. But based on the data we have, what we are seeing, it should be -- it should moderate. But we would expect the next two to three quarters to kind of back to those levels. From a mix perspective, though, that mix, we actually think mix is going to get better. We expect mix to continue to moderate. I think I mentioned earlier that Q2, Q3, we saw an improvement. As we get into Q4, we should see that get better. And as we get into next year, we expect this to be not a huge headwind. And we'll see how that plays out, but that's our best thinking at this point.\nSara Senatore: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.\nGregory Francfort: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. A lot of what I wanted to ask was asked, but I wanted to ask you about the commodity outlook and thoughts into the fourth quarter. Maybe what's implied in risks to the upside or downside on that going forward? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Hey Greg, sorry. As far as -- on the commodity side, if you look at where -- what we expect, we expect third quarter to be around -- the implied guidance would be around 3% for commodities inflation. And part of the reason it's going up relative to where we've been is that everything except for seafood is inflationary as we move into the fourth quarter. Now not huge, but as you look at beef and produce are more in the mid-single to high single-digit inflation. And then most other categories are in low single digits. So a little bit of that is just a comparison to last year, a function of the levels last year. But from a coverage point, we're at 75% covered for Q4 which is consistent with historical average levels. And I think on beef, we're actually 80% covered for Q4. As far as we look into '25, we're, as I said earlier, we're in the middle of planning process for next year. So we'll be able to share more in the June call. But I think at this point, we are working through some contracts for next year. So I would hesitate to share a lot at this point.\nGregory Francfort: Thank you for the perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Patrick Johnson from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nPatrick Johnson: Great, thanks, good morning guys. Rick, I wanted to touch on menu innovation, particularly at Olive Garden and LongHorn. And I'm just curious if there are any opportunities you see to either introduce permanent menu items that still align with the brand strategy or even if there's potential to create limited time platforms like Never Ending Pasta Bowl that aren't necessarily discounted, but could drive incremental interest in visits over time?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Patrick. There's always room for menu innovation. We've got to balance innovation and new items with improving our existing items and making sure our menu stay compact and simpler than they were before COVID. And there's also always room for kind of limited time, not necessarily promotional offers. So currently, LongHorn has lamb on their menu, and it does really well. It's doing a lot better than it did last year. And with brands like Cheddar's, we use opportunity buys to put some items on the menu, but at really great values. And Olive Garden is continuing to look at ways to improve some of their items and maybe introduce an item but take off an item. So yes, we still have a lot of work that we do with innovation. But most of our guests come to us for what we have on our menu today and we're not going to alienate the core guest by completely changing those menus around and we don't plan on getting back to a six or seven-week promotion where an item is great. It does great for six weeks and then the guest comes back in week 10, and it's not there anymore. And so we'll continue to innovate but we'll continue to invade a lot more on improvements, but we'll introduce new items here and there.\nPatrick Johnson: Great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you very much. A few follow-ups. Can you just talk about the same-store sales differences that you're seeing across regions? And then from a marketing perspective, you're now running less than 1.5% of sales this year, well below pre-COVID at 3% or even north. So I understand you want to be prudent and protect long-term. Why is this the right level of marketing spend today? How do you assess it even if it's not deep discounting?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Lauren, so from a regional perspective, we continue to see softness in Texas and California. I think Texas pretty much throughout the year, we had seen weakness, and that continues to be the case. Florida was a little weaker, but nothing crazy. But you also had the weather impact that probably disproportionately impacted both Texas and California during Q3. Different types of events, but weather there, so that's regional. From a marketing perspective, we've been very clear that, look, we're going to be prudent, we're going to be very deliberate in how we bring back marketing. We've learned a lot in terms of the effectiveness of marketing in different channels, how we deploy it. And we've talked about bringing it back at a level that's more methodical in terms of 10 to 20 basis points increase over time in a way that's margin neutral, all else being equal. So that's kind of really what -- how we're thinking about it. And we have done a lot of work. We continue to do a lot of work on marketing mix analysis and we got our teams of data scientists internally and work with some external partners to ensure that we're getting the appropriate return, and it's actually being effective the way we want it to be, which is to elevate brand equity and build long-term guest loyalty.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. And then if I can just -- on the guide, lower sales maintained or increased the lower end of the guide, inflation more favorable. Any other puts and takes in the guide for the year? And then can you just clarify what you're expecting for the full year on G&A? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Let me start with the G&A. We expect G&A to be pretty similar to what we said last time, $440 million, I think, is what we said for last -- in the last quarter. So call it roughly $100 million for Q4. Look, I think the big things are we've obviously brought down some sales expectation but inflation is better. And then our teams are doing a better job managing our business. So there is some improvement in productivity, improvement in other waste and other types of inefficiencies. But outside of that, nothing that's not outside of those few items that I've just mentioned. But if you just step back and look at what we -- where we started the year, right? If we look at the beginning of the year, we said earnings guidance was $8.55 to $8.85. And we said, to the extent sales slowdown or we see weakness in sales, we should see inflation come down and our cost management continue to help us get us closer to that. And today, we're talking about earnings guidance of $8.80 to $8.90, now with a lot lower sales, but we got there through other wins. So again, I don't want to say what we said, we told you, but it's just -- that is reality. That's what happened.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is now live.\nPeter Saleh: Hey, great. Thanks for taking the question. I apologize if I missed this, but I know you guys commented on the traffic softness for the lower-income consumer and maybe by cohort. But can you maybe discuss the behavior of those consumers in terms of their check management? Are you seeing a lot of trade down for the consumers that are coming in within the menu or within brands? Or are they cutting alcohol or appetizers or desserts? Or just anything that suggests that those consumers that are coming in are also managing that check down? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Interestingly, from a check management perspective, it's not as much driven by income. The gap is more driven by older consumers, especially 65 plus is managing the check a little bit more. It's not -- irrespective of their income is what we're seeing. And they are also, I think Rick mentioned earlier, they're shifting more to lunch. So we're seeing a couple of things. They're getting a little bit less add-ons, but also managing the check. But also, like I said earlier, from Q2 to Q3, it's actually less management of check. Now with a little bit less traffic, but that's -- but what's happening is check management is actually getting better. In terms of negative mix, it's not as big as it was in Q2.\nPeter Saleh: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nBrian Vaccaro: Hi. Thanks and good morning. For my question, and sorry if I missed it, but could you share what traffic in the quarter was for Olive Garden and LongHorn? I know that's usually in the queue, but did you or can you share that?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, sure. Olive Garden check was 2% in the quarter. So basically, traffic would be negative 3.8%. And then LongHorn traffic was in the mid-negative 2s.\nBrian Vaccaro: Okay, thank you for that. And I guess you've had this question a couple of times, but I'll ask it this way. In an environment where you're seeing softness on the lower-end consumer and maybe there's just a broader backdrop where value seems increasingly important, I guess it's interesting to see Olive Garden's relative comp outperformance narrow, given the brand's strong everyday value positioning. So I guess, how do you reconcile that? And is there any evidence that you're starting to see some profitable guests to certain brands, not asking for names, but certain brands that are gaining share or have shifted their tactics in the last year?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Brian. If you think about Olive Garden. So as Raj said, Olive Garden exceeded the industry benchmark for same-restaurant traffic by 270 basis points. They spent less in media at a time when many of their competitors ramped up discounts on television. So they exceeded by 270 with less media and when others were ramping up. Their two-year gap is 830 basis points, so that's a big share gain over two years. So I'm really proud of the work that Dan and his team have done to improve the guest experience. They continue to focus on their key equity of never-ending, craveable, abundant Italian food, specifically focusing on ensuring every guest is offered a refill on their never-ending first course. And that's a huge value. I can't tell you if our -- if an Olive Garden guest has shifted over to one of those competitors, but I can tell you that we trade guests all the time. Some of our biggest -- Olive Garden's biggest competitors are the ones that are doing some of the discounting today. And so we're really proud of the 270 basis point gap on top of the gap they had before. And if we're seeding a profitable guest, I don't think it's a seed forever. It's just because people shift and they move around. And so we're going to keep focusing on what we can do to keep our guests coming back for one visit.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you. That concludes our call. I'd like to remind you that we plan to release fourth quarter results on Thursday, June 20, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thanks again for participating in today's call, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Raj Vennam",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter earnings were in line with our expectations, although our sales were softer than we anticipated. We were pleased with December's strong holiday performance as the month's same-restaurant sales were in line with our second quarter results. However, winter weather in January negatively impacted traffic results by approximately 100 basis points for the quarter. As we moved into February, sales trends improved, but were below our expectations, exposing some underlying consumer weakness. Despite the unexpected variability in our sales trends, our teams did a great job managing their businesses. In the third quarter, we generated $3 billion of total sales, 6.8% higher than last year, driven by the acquisition of Ruth's Chris Steak House and 55 net new restaurants, which was partially offset by negative same-restaurant sales of 1%. We outperformed the industry again this quarter with same-restaurant sales that were 320 basis points better than the industry and same-restaurant guest counts that were 270 basis points better. And on a two-year basis, we have outperformed on same-restaurant sales by 770 basis points and by 970 basis points on same-restaurant guest counts. Our focus on managing the business and controlling costs resulted in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.62 in the quarter, an increase of 12% from last year's reported earnings per share. We generated $512 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $190 million of capital to our shareholders through $157 million in dividends and $33 million of share repurchases. Now looking at our adjusted margin analysis, compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 90 basis points better, driven by pricing leverage. Total commodities inflation of approximately 1.5% was below our total pricing of approximately 3.5%. Restaurant labor was 10 basis points unfavorable to last year due to total labor inflation of approximately 4.5%, partially offset by pricing and productivity improvements at our brand. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points higher as sales deal average was partially offset by strong cost management by our teams. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our expectations. All of this resulted in restaurant-level EBITDA of 20.6%, 70 basis points better than last year. G&A as a percent of sales was 40 basis points lower than last year, and total expense was slightly favorable to our previous guidance related to lower incentive compensation and ongoing synergies from the integration of Ruth's Chris. Interest expense increased 50 basis points versus last year, due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth's Chris acquisition. And for the quarter, adjusted earnings from continuing operations was 10.6% of sales, 30 basis points better than last year. Looking at our segments, Olive Garden increased total sales by 0.7%, driven by new restaurant growth, partially offset by negative same-restaurant sales of 1.8%. Olive Garden same-restaurant sales outperformed the industry benchmark by 240 basis points, and their traffic outperformed the industry by 270 basis points. Despite the negative same-restaurant sales, Olive Garden segment profit margin of 22.5% was flat to last year. At LongHorn, total sales increased 5.1%, driven by new restaurant growth and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.3%. LongHorn same-restaurant sales outperformed the industry by 650 basis points. Segment profit margin of 18.7% was 130 basis points above last year, driven by pricing leverage and improved labor productivity. Total sales at fine dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants. Same-restaurant sales at both Capital Grille and Eddie V's were negative as the fine dining category continued to be challenged year-over-year. Fine dining segment profit margin was flat year-over-year at 21.8%. The other business segment sales increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris franchise and managed location revenue, but was partially offset by combined negative same-restaurant sales of 2.6% for the brands in the other segment. However, this was still 160 basis points above the industry benchmark. Segment profit margin of 14.9% was 90 basis points better than last year, driven by the additional royalty revenues and higher overall pricing relative to inflation. Turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024, we have updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the fourth quarter. We now expect total sales of approximately $11.4 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 1.5% to 2%, 50 to 55 new restaurants, capital spending of approximately $600 million, total inflation of approximately 3%, including commodities inflation of approximately 1.5%, an annual effective tax rate of 12% to 12.5%, and approximately 121 million diluted average share outstanding for the year. This results in an increased or adjusted diluted net earnings per share outlook of $8.80 to $8.90, which excludes approximately $55 million of pre-tax transaction and integration related costs. For the fourth quarter specifically, our annual outlook implies sales of $2.95 billion to $2.99 billion, same-restaurant sales between negative 0.5% and positive 1%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share between $2.58 and $2.68. Now looking forward into fiscal 2025, we plan on opening between 45 and 50 new restaurants and spending between $250 million and $300 million of capital for those new restaurants. Additionally, we anticipate approximately $300 million of capital spending related to ongoing restaurant maintenance, refresh, and technology. And finally, we anticipated effective tax rate of approximately 13% for fiscal 2025. And now I'd like to close by saying that we continue to be very proud of how our teams are managing their businesses to deliver strong results in this dynamic environment. With that, we'll open the call for questions. Hey, Eric. This is Raj. So, from a margin perspective, if you look at where -- what we talked about at the beginning of the year, we -- this was one of the years where we had a pricing a little bit above inflation going into the fiscal year. But as the year progressed, inflation came down -- inflation came in better than we expected for both commodities and labor. And then that combined with our team's strong cost management that improved productivity on the labor front. We also improved our waste. We had some favorability on the mix in terms of how the trading happened between the items. So all of these were contributors to our margin improvement versus our plan. Now, as we look at next year, we'll share more details in June, but the way we look at as we're going through the planning process right now, but we'll always use our long-term framework as a guidepost to inform how we think of our plan. So we'll share more details in June. And -- but we have -- if you look back over the last four years, we were underpriced a lot. Yes, Brian, for Q4, we're still expecting that gap to be in the 100 to 150. So overall inflation is expected to be in the mid-3s for us and the pricing is probably going to be in the 2 to 2.5. So we still expect underprice inflation by -- in that range of 100 to 150 in Q4. Yes. We're actually -- for the check for the third quarter, we actually saw the mix moderate the levels we saw -- in terms of what we saw in Q2. So if you look at our casual brands, the negative mix was around 40 basis points. In Q2, it was closer to 60 basis points. And then from the Fine Dining, we saw a huge improvement. I think Fine Dining in the second quarter was north of 200 basis points negative mix. We're now seeing in the low 100 basis points negative mix. So that's almost half. So we are seeing some improvement in terms of check mix. And part of that could be a wrap, but also the holidays were pretty strong. And so that -- on that front, we're actually seeing a positive momentum, I guess, quarter-to-quarter. Yes. From an off-premise perspective, our sales as a percent of sales was slightly below last year, but not a lot. This is typically a high season for Olive Garden off-premise. So Q3 was closer to 26%. Last year was also in that range. We were probably 40, 50 basis points lower, but not a lot. And LongHorn was around 13%, which was also about 40 or 30 basis points lower. But overall, I think it goes back to the execution. Our focus has been staying on just ensuring that we executed the highest levels for off-premise, and that's helped contribute to maintaining the stability. Andrew, I think we're still in that ballpark of 10%-plus. But if you actually look at the last year or so, there have been more closures than openings from the data we've seen. So net, there's net closings even in the last nine, 12 months data that we're looking at. When you think about the environment today, with all the regulation around where things are, it's very hard for someone to open a new restaurant. The financing costs have gone up. There is less developments happening, that's actually part of the reason we talked about some growth being constrained a little bit in the near term for us on the unit opening. So we would say it's not that different. It has not gotten much better. Maybe let's put it that way. Yes. I would say, assume that two-thirds of the growth is going to be coming from Olive Garden and LongHorn combined, and then the rest is -- one-third is from all the other brands. I don't know that we would say there's a huge difference year-over-year. It's a little bit of a change. But as we look forward, as Rick said, we'll continue to try to get that ramped up further. So Danilo, I think as we talked about in the past, there's a lot of things, right? First of all, let's start with the big picture. We've talked about how, in general, Steak does a little bit better when beef prices are higher just because of the relative gap between the consumer would rather not take risk on cooking something that's expensive. So let's start with that big picture. With that said, within the steak category, not everybody is winning. So if you look at LongHorn, our performance has been driven by our execution. We talk about the simple operations, quality, investments in quality. So our team, Todd and the team have done a great job over the last four years, invest -- continuing to invest in the food and in service. And so if you look at it overall, you get a better value today than you ever did. So if you look at their pricing, it has been a lot lower in the industry versus the industry and especially for the Steak House, their pricing has been much lower than the competition. So the value equation is much better and a great execution. Really, those are the two things. Okay. Let's start with the gap itself. So if you look at the gap in January, the gap narrowed a bit, we think primarily because of the geography and the footprint we have that has disproportionately impacted by weather. If you look at the concentration of where the weather was, that was a higher concentration of our restaurants. And we think that's part of the reason the gap was not as strong. Now the other part of this gap narrowing this quarter related to the last quarter was the fact that we're wrapping on huge gap from a year ago. We had a very strong performance a year ago. So that's really how we would kind of frame that. We're not -- look, we've been clear that it's very hard to maintain multiple hundreds of basis points of gap forever. We're going to have that narrow over time. But things we've done with our pricing and our value equation have helped us continue to take share, and we're happy with that. And as Rick said earlier, in an environment when there was intensity -- in promotional intensity, more so than ever, we still outperformed, and we were able to gain share. So that's the piece on the industry. Now as you look at the income mix, yes, we -- so this has been an ongoing shift. So we've talked about in Q2 that we're starting to see a shift a little bit more towards the pre-COVID mix. So we are -- so as we wrap -- as we looked at Q4 now, Q3 that just ended, we were right essentially where we were before COVID. So yes, the next three quarters, there's a little bit of moderation of getting that, but it's not as big as it was this quarter. If you think about -- we don't think. I mean we'll have to see. But based on the data we have, what we are seeing, it should be -- it should moderate. But we would expect the next two to three quarters to kind of back to those levels. From a mix perspective, though, that mix, we actually think mix is going to get better. We expect mix to continue to moderate. I think I mentioned earlier that Q2, Q3, we saw an improvement. As we get into Q4, we should see that get better. And as we get into next year, we expect this to be not a huge headwind. And we'll see how that plays out, but that's our best thinking at this point. Hey Greg, sorry. As far as -- on the commodity side, if you look at where -- what we expect, we expect third quarter to be around -- the implied guidance would be around 3% for commodities inflation. And part of the reason it's going up relative to where we've been is that everything except for seafood is inflationary as we move into the fourth quarter.

Yes. Let me start with the G&A. We expect G&A to be pretty similar to what we said last time, $440 million, I think, is what we said for last -- in the last quarter.

Interestingly, from a check management perspective, it's not as much driven by income. The gap is more driven by older consumers, especially 65 plus is managing the check a little bit more. It's not -- irrespective of their income is what we're seeing. And they are also, I think Rick mentioned earlier, they're shifting more to lunch. So we're seeing a couple of things. They're getting a little bit less add-ons, but also managing the check. But also, like I said earlier, from Q2 to Q3, it's actually less management of check. Now with a little bit less traffic, but that's -- but what's happening is check management is actually getting better. In terms of negative mix, it's not as big as it was in Q2. Yes, sure. Olive Garden check was 2% in the quarter. So basically, traffic would be negative 3.8%. And then LongHorn traffic was in the mid-negative 2s."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'm proud of our results this quarter. Each one of our segments grew total sales and profit in an operating environment that was tougher than we anticipated. We continued to outperform the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic. Total sales were $3 billion, an increase of 6.8%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $2.62, which was in line with our expectations. We opened 16 restaurants during this quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, we have opened 43 restaurants in 22 states, seven of which were reopenings. The quarter started well with strong holiday performance in December, but unfavorable winter weather negatively impacted January traffic. And while February results improved, we experienced some underlying softness we had not seen in the months leading up to January. The lower income consumer does appear to be pulling back, and the mix of guests based on income is now in line with pre-COVID. I am proud that even as industry traffic trends weakened, we were able to gain share. We continue to focus on controlling what we can control, leveraging and strengthening our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and our results-oriented culture, and executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy anchored in food, service, and atmosphere. Our restaurant teams continue to perform at their best, especially during our busiest times. In December, the Capital Grille set their all-time total monthly sales record. In February, Eddie V's set their all-time total weekly sales record, and Olive Garden established a new sales record for Valentine's Day. Our internal guest satisfaction metrics reflect our team's focus on being brilliant with the basics. All of our brands remained at or near all-time highs for overall guest satisfaction during the quarter. Additionally, within the casual dining, polished casual and fine dining segments of Technomic's industry tracking tool, the Darden brand was ranked number one for overall experience. The brands were LongHorn Steakhouse, Seasons 52, and Ruth's Chris Steak House. Our team's ability to execute at a high level is driven by strong leadership and team member engagement across our brands. We work hard to ensure our results-oriented culture is a competitive advantage for us, and our industry-leading retention rates confirm it is in an area of strength. During the quarter, we completed our biannual engagement survey, and a result showed that our overall level of engagement is at an all-time high. Also, during the quarter, three of our brands were recognized as industry leaders in Black Box Intelligence, LongHorn, the Capital Grille, and Seasons 52 each received the Employer of Choice Award. Now let me provide a quick update on Ruth Chris. We are in the final stage of integration and remain on track to complete the major changes by the end of the fiscal year. We successfully completed the migration onto our HR platform at the end of December, and all restaurants have now successfully transitioned to our distribution network. Currently, we are halfway through converting the restaurants over to our point of sale system, and we are on track to complete that work by the end of May. This is the most challenging part of integration, and I'm really proud of the focus the Ruth's Chris team continues to have on delivering exceptional guest experiences. This can be seen in the fact that Ruth's Chris was named America's favorite chain restaurant in Technomic's annual survey that was released during the quarter. The survey measures perceptions of service and hospitality, unit appearance and ambiance, food and beverage, convenience and value. In addition to Ruth's Chris, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze, LongHorn and the Capital Grille were all ranked in the top 10. Overall, I am pleased with our performance this quarter. We continue to manage the business for the long-term by executing against our strategy and controlling what we can control. We also continue to work in pursuit of our shared purpose to nourish and delight everyone we serve. One of the ways we do this is for our team members and their families is through our Next Course Scholarship program. Earlier this month the Darden Foundation awarded more than 100 post-secondary education scholarships worth $3,000 each to children of Darden team members. Education is one of the greatest equalizers in our country, and I'm thrilled that we can create a lasting impact on the lives of our team members' families through this program. Finally, I want to thank our 190,000 team members for everything you do to create exceptional experiences for our guests. You are the reason brands continue to be recognized as great places to work and top dining destinations. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Hey, Eric. We're clearly seeing consumer behavior shifts. Our data shows we're essentially back to our normal pre-COVID mix across all income groups. But specifically your question, for the third quarter, transactions from households with incomes above $150,000 were higher than last year. Transactions from incomes below $75,000 were much lower than last year. And at every brand, transactions fell from incomes below $50,000. Similar to Q2, this shift was most pronounced in our fine dining segment. Hey, Brian. Yes, we can't determine whether it's going to be impacting the rest of the year. What we can say -- what I can say is that impact to the low-end consumer was a year-over-year phenomenon. And now we're back to our pre-COVID mix. And so if you think about where we were before COVID, what percent of our guests were below 50,000, what percent of our below 75%, et cetera, across all of our segments, all of our brands, it's almost exactly the same as it was before COVID. So at least that makes us feel like we know how to operate in this environment. The other thing is if you look at Black Box, according to Black Box, every segment in the industry, from QSR and up was negative in same-restaurant traffic in our third quarter, every one of them. So that's also a year-over-year phenomenon. And so we'll continue to monitor what we see with the guest and what we see on that lower end consumer. But we're pleased that it's back to our normal or normal pre-COVID levels. And in respect to marketing, as we've talked about often, we're focused on profitable sales growth. And our brands, all of our segments improved sales and profits for the quarter year-over-year. And we, even with the increase in competitive activity, we expected -- we exceeded, I'm sorry, industry traffic by 270 basis points on top of the 700 basis point gap we had in Q3 last year, so almost 1,000 points, so 970-point gap in two years. So we're going to stick to our strategy of everyday value to our guests and continue to use our filters to evaluate any marketing activity. If that means that we're going to spend a little bit more in a quarter or a little bit less in a quarter, that's what we'll do. But we're going to focus on our strategy and stick to it as long as we can. Thanks. Brian, I'll start with how we manage labor and productivity, and then I'll let Raj answer the question on the pricing. So if you think about what we've been doing over the years, we've been improving our technology on guest count forecasting by using machine learning and AI tools to help the brands write better schedules and manage their business better and we're able to react quicker to impacts that we see in our restaurants, but we're also continuing to find ways to improve productivity. And one of the ways and the benefit that we had this quarter is continued improvement in turnover. And so we've had less training expense for new team members. And we've got better retention, team members know how to do their job better. In the turnover ranks, where we are today across Darden, our turnover went down by about 20 basis point -- 20 percentage points versus last year and almost 30 percentage points better than the industry. And now our turnover is much closer to pre-COVID levels, except for Yard House and Cheddar's, which actually we believe are at a level lower than they've ever had in their history. So those things help with labor and food costs and other parts of the P&L. And I'll let Raj answer the other part about inflation. Hey Jon, if you think about the amount we spend, even with the spending that we had this quarter, Olive Garden in most of the weeks were in the top three in share of voice. And so we're still in front of our consumer. We have other ways to get in front of the consumer with our eClub and with other digital spend. But at the end of the day, the best way to get people to come into our restaurants is to have guests recommend us to others. And so that's what we're continuing to focus on. We will continue to use marketing with our filters to talk about our core equities and to continue to drive results in the long-term. And we do have great everyday value. And what -- as we think about what we want to do in the future, I don't want to get into the details, but we have levers to pull. And if we pull them, you'll know after we pull them. Yes, Jon, you said it, the new restaurant projection we have for next year, it is within our long-term framework but it's lower than we'd like it to be. We're going to keep working on getting to the high end of that framework over time, but it will take a little bit of time. I would say construction costs were quite a bit higher than pre-COVID levels. And we have walked away from some deals, because of the construction costs and they've come back to us after we walked away. And so we're willing to slow it down a little bit to get a better result in the long-term. And -- but the good news is, at least the construction cost has stabilized. The other thing is it's still taking longer to get construction starts than it was four years ago. It's also taking longer to get to completion than it was in the past. And so if you think of it at that time it will take to build a restaurant, it's longer than it was. A lot of that is driven by developers, utilities, hookups and time for permitting and also time for getting certificates of occupancy. So if you think about the time that we have openings, we've got a lot of our openings next year towards the end, which could slip. And that's what we just wanted to make sure that we get the number -- that we tell you a number that we're going to hit. But we want to get closer to that high end over the long-term. And the other thing is I want everybody to remember we do include M&A as part of those new restaurants. And we didn't talk about that, but Ruth's Chris, we added 77 restaurants this year. So it gave us a little bit of a relief valve to not be so aggressive if we didn't need to be aggressive. Yes, David, as we think about the levers we can pull, we have -- as we've talked over the years, we brought our marketing down. We've actually focused more on our core equities. And every year, we might take marketing up a little bit, but we're not going to strategic -- we're not going to change our strategy. We're not going to become a discount kind of heavily promotional brand. We worked really hard through COVID and before to get to what we think is a better, stable, stronger business for us for the long-term. And we would be willing to deal with short-term pressures to not change our strategy to get to the long-term. Now again, we have some tactics that we can do, which would still stick to our strategy, but we're not going to -- we don't plan on getting to be a promotional deep discounting brand. Again, Olive Garden, which had less marketing in Q3 than it did in Q2, while they had less marketing than last year and in the second quarter, our competitors had more, Olive Garden still gained share. And that's what our focus is, is to share gain, sales and profit growth over the time. We're going to continue to focus on execution, our food, our service and our atmosphere to increase frequency with our core guests. And we love our core guests. We think they're great for us, and we'll continue to build over time. We're just not going to fight gravity on what's going on in the environment. We're going to stick to what we want to do. And then on the pricing side, we -- our strategy is to continue to price below inflation over time. And we've taken a lot less pricing than the competitive set. We've taken a lot less pricing than CPI, a lot less pricing than full service, limited service over the last four years. So it gives us some room to continue to price if we need to. But our still -- our plan is still over the long term to price below inflation. Yes, Jeff, I think it's a broader market versus any specific missteps we had. Our gap increased from January to February, our traffic and sales gap increased, both of those increased between January and February. And as I said, every category in the industry from QSR and up had negative traffic in the quarter. And so I think there's a little bit of a bigger challenge, at least a year-over-year challenge for our consumer. And we're going to see how that plays out over the next couple of quarters and see if there's anything we need to change, but it won't be a dramatic change. Yes. I would say, first of all, our guidance contemplates everything we know about March. I don't want to get into March. We have a lot of challenges forecasting three weeks in the month, when you've got spring break shifts and those kind of things happen. And so we're going to continue to watch. I think I've read a little bit on tax returns being a little bit delayed. But we're not going to read too much into that. Our -- we improved our gap between January and February. And so that's what we feel good about. We're not going to talk about March yet. Yes, I would say that if you think about our results being a little bit softer than we thought, I would put it more at the feet at the lower end and the higher end. Our higher-end consumer was up versus last year. So that would tell you that it was really more on the lower end consumer. But as I think about what the consumer trends are, I just want to remind everybody that we believe that operators that can deliver on their brand promise with value can continue to appeal consumers despite economic challenges. And that's what we're going to continue to focus on doing. I remain confident that we're well positioned and prepared for whatever we have to deal with. Thanks to the breadth of those nine brands that Jeff talked about, the strategic decision we made to price well below inflation and CPI over the last four years and those outstanding team members we have in our restaurants who are committed to create exceptional guest experiences for our guests. And so yes, the lower end consumer probably drove a little bit more of our miss to what we thought when we talked to you before, but we're going to continue to focus on what we do and take care of every guest that walks in the door at the best that we can to have them to come back. Yes, Jeff. I think if you look at our gap over two years, our gap to the industry, as I said, being almost 1,000 basis points -- I'm sorry, yes, 10% gap over the three years. It's been strong. And that's what we do. We're taking this price below inflation, having a great everyday value. And we think over the long term, that continues to build the value differential we have. We've got value leaders across and that helps build the traffic gap. Hey, John. Yes, that was -- the deep discounting, couponing, a lot of promotions was kind of a Darden pre-COVID. This is the Darden post-COVID, which is when we're talking about marketing, being things that elevate brand equity that are easy to execute and they're not at a deep discount. It doesn't mean that we won't have price points on things over time, but that's kind of more of our everyday low price or around that price. You think about Never Ending Pasta Bowl, we ran that this year at $13.99. It was a great promotion for us. And that was at $13.99. So we can think about doing those things again next year with Never Ending Pasta Bowl. We already have buy one take one on our menu basically, with the $6 take homes. So there's a lot of everyday value already. In terms of kind of talking to the higher-end consumer, as I mentioned, we actually grew at the higher end consumer at all of our segments. The 200,000-plus, 150-plus was up year-over-year. But I think you could see a little -- a few signs of some consumers trading down within our brands. When you think about LongHorn did really well with -- as they grew even at a little bit -- at the high-end consumer at a little bit lower, the 150, 125, and they had actually positive check. And so we're seeing some of that shift in some ways. And so we think as long as we execute great and we have great word of mouth, that will get that higher-end consumer maybe to trade to one of our brands from someone else, even if it trades from one of our current brands to one of our brands, that's fine with us, too. But again, long-term, every day, talk about what our core equities are, execute better than the restaurant next door, and we'll win, and we'll deal with short-term challenges. We're happy with the current approach. If you think about loyalty and full-service restaurants, frequency isn't super high. And we've learned that when we did loyalty before. And so it's a little bit less valuable for a consumer, we believe. Now there's other ways to get that data. The value of loyalty is the data that you get, and we have other ways to grab that data. Doesn't mean that we won't think about loyalty in the future. We're just focusing on what we can do right now to continue to execute better to drive results and not to drive something that's just buying sales, because we'll have to keep buying it next year and the year after that. We don't want to go out and buy sales. We want to go out and earn those sales. Well, let me start by saying, I think we serve about 100 -- about 1 million guests a day. across all of our brands, or more than that actually. And so we get a lot of people coming in. Our frequency hasn't dramatically changed over the last year. And our eClub is roughly between 25 million and 30 million guests, that's active eClub. We have more members, but they're active. And so we have ways to communicate with that and that's across all of our brands. And so we're really confident now that we've got our, as I said earlier, on the income demographic back to where we were pre-COVID, we know how to operate in that environment. We're seeing some shifts at the above 65-years old, and we've talked about that before. They're shifting a little bit more to lunch a little bit earlier to dine, and that's great. But so those are the only real major shifts we've seen. Yes, Patrick. There's always room for menu innovation. We've got to balance innovation and new items with improving our existing items and making sure our menu stay compact and simpler than they were before COVID. And there's also always room for kind of limited time, not necessarily promotional offers. So currently, LongHorn has lamb on their menu, and it does really well. It's doing a lot better than it did last year. And with brands like Cheddar's, we use opportunity buys to put some items on the menu, but at really great values. And Olive Garden is continuing to look at ways to improve some of their items and maybe introduce an item but take off an item. So yes, we still have a lot of work that we do with innovation. But most of our guests come to us for what we have on our menu today and we're not going to alienate the core guest by completely changing those menus around and we don't plan on getting back to a six or seven-week promotion where an item is great. It does great for six weeks and then the guest comes back in week 10, and it's not there anymore. And so we'll continue to innovate but we'll continue to invade a lot more on improvements, but we'll introduce new items here and there. Yes, Brian. If you think about Olive Garden. So as Raj said, Olive Garden exceeded the industry benchmark for same-restaurant traffic by 270 basis points. They spent less in media at a time when many of their competitors ramped up discounts on television. So they exceeded by 270 with less media and when others were ramping up. Their two-year gap is 830 basis points, so that's a big share gain over two years. So I'm really proud of the work that Dan and his team have done to improve the guest experience. They continue to focus on their key equity of never-ending, craveable, abundant Italian food, specifically focusing on ensuring every guest is offered a refill on their never-ending first course. And that's a huge value. I can't tell you if our -- if an Olive Garden guest has shifted over to one of those competitors, but I can tell you that we trade guests all the time. Some of our biggest -- Olive Garden's biggest competitors are the ones that are doing some of the discounting today. And so we're really proud of the 270 basis point gap on top of the gap they had before. And if we're seeding a profitable guest, I don't think it's a seed forever. It's just because people shift and they move around. And so we're going to keep focusing on what we can do to keep our guests coming back for one visit."

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak. Thank you. You may begin.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me today are Rick Cardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during the call will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed this morning, and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at darden.com. Today's discussion and presentation includes certain non-GAAP measurements, and reconciliations of these measurements are included in that presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2024 third quarter earnings on Thursday, March 21st, before the market opens, followed by a conference call. During today's call, any reference to pre-COVID when discussing second quarter performance is a comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Additionally, all references to industry results during today's call refer to Black Box Intelligence, casual dining benchmark, excluding Darden, specifically Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen. During our second fiscal quarter, industry same-restaurant sales decreased 1.3% and industry same-restaurant guest counts decreased 4.8%. This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter, and Raj will provide details on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter, which outperformed the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales and traffic. Total sales were $2.7 billion, an increase of 9.7%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.84. We opened 17 restaurants during the quarter. Fiscal year to date, we have opened 27 restaurants in 16 states, four of which were re-openings. We continue to stick to our strategy, driven by our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and a results-oriented culture. And our brands are relentlessly focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere. This focus on being brilliant with the basics enables our brands to consistently perform at a high level. Our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain strong across all of our brands. In fact, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze reached all-time highs for overall guest satisfaction during the quarter. LongHorn also ranked number one among major casual dining brands in six of the seven key measurement categories within Technomic's industry tracking tool, including food, service, atmosphere and value. LongHorn's continued adherence to their strategy is driving strong execution, which can also be seen in the fact that they established an all-time high stakes grilled correctly score. During the quarter, Olive Garden ran Never Ending Pasta Bowl. It was offered at the same price point as last year, making it an even stronger value. Guest demand was higher this year and our restaurant teams did a great job delivering outstanding guest experiences, achieving the highest refill rate ever. This performance was driven by our focus on ensuring every guest is offered a refill, whether it's a limited time offer like Never Ending Pasta Bowl, or our Never Ending First Course, which is offered every day. This iconic promotion also satisfies all three of our marketing activity filters. It elevates brand equity, it's simple to execute, and it's not at a deep discount. Also, I'm excited to share that during the second quarter, and for the first time in their history, Olive Garden surpassed $5 billion in sales on a trailing 52-week basis. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for all of our restaurant teams, and they embrace the opportunity to perform at their best. On Thanksgiving Day, our teams at Ruth's Chris, The Capital Grille, Eddie V's and Seasons 52 did just that, with each setting a new daily sales record. And while we experienced some softness at our fine dining brands during the quarter, we are encouraged by the strong holiday bookings we are seeing. Now, let me provide a brief update on Ruth's Chris. Even in the midst of the integration, I'm really proud of how the entire team has remained focused on the guest experience. During the quarter, Ruth's Chris achieved the top box -- top overall rating score among all full-service dining brands within Technomic's industry tracking tool. From an integration perspective, things are progressing well, and we are on track to complete the major systems changes by the end of the fiscal year. During the quarter, we closed their former corporate office and the Ruth's Chris support team moved into our restaurant support center. We are excited to have them here. In October, we successfully transitioned 21 restaurants to one of our distribution centers, and we plan to transition the remaining company operated restaurants to our distribution system between January and March. This phased approach allows us to gather learnings and improve the transition for the other restaurants, while capturing supply chain synergies. We are deliberate with the timing of any changes to ensure that we minimize the operational impact as much as possible. We are on track to deploy our people management systems by the end of the calendar year and beginning -- begin rolling out our proprietary point of sale system after Valentine's Day with the goal of completing all systems integration by the end of the fiscal year. As part of the investments we announced on our last call, we have made some strategic decisions at company owned restaurants that will impact total sales in the third quarter. First, we stopped third-party delivery. Second, we eliminated lunch wherever possible, and we will be closing most restaurants on Christmas Day. I can't say enough about the tremendous partnership between the Ruth's Chris team and our integration team. Integration is never easy, but it has been a collaborative process, and I\u2019m happy with the progress we are making. We have reached the halfway point in our fiscal year, and I'm pleased with our performance thus far. All of our brands remain focused on managing the business for the long term and the power of Darden positions us well for the future. We also continue to work in pursuit of our shared purpose, to nourish and delight everyone we serve. One of the ways we do this for our team members and their families is through our Next Course Scholarship program. Applications opened last month for the program, which awards post-secondary education scholarships worth $3,000 each to children or dependents of Darden team members. Last year, we awarded nearly 100 scholarships to children of team members at both our restaurants and our support center. The Next Course Scholarship creates a lasting impact on the lives of our team members' families, and I'm excited that we are offering the program for a second year. Finally, as I said earlier, the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams. I am so proud of the focus and commitment that all our teams continue to have every day. On behalf of our senior leadership team and Board of Directors, I want to thank our more than 190,000 team members for everything you do to delight our guests and help create special holiday memories. I wish you and your families a wonderful holiday season. Now, I will turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick. And good morning, everyone. Our teams did a great job managing their businesses again this quarter, resulting in meaningful restaurant level and total margin growth. This margin growth was driven by positive same-restaurant sales growth, strong labor management and lower than anticipated restaurant and commodities' expenses. We generated $2.7 billion of total sales for the second quarter, 9.7% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 78 company-owned Ruth's Chris Steak House restaurants, 45 legacy Darden new restaurants, and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.8%. Our same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 410 basis points and same-restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 370 basis points. Our focus on managing the business and controlling costs resulted in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.84 in the second quarter, an increase of 21% from last year's reported earnings per share. We generated $403 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $340 million of capital to our shareholders through $158 million in dividends and $181 million of share repurchases. Now, looking at our adjusted margin analysis compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 190 basis points better, driven by pricing leverage. Total commodities inflation was flat to prior year for the quarter and slightly better than our expectations, while beef inflation continues to track in line with our expectations, most other categories are seeing some favorability. Restaurant labor was 20 basis points better than last year, driven by productivity improvements at our brands as pricing and inflation were roughly equal at 5%. Restaurant expenses were 30 basis points favorable, primarily due to lower workers' compensation expense and deflation in utilities. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our expectations. All of these factors resulted in restaurant level EBITDA of 18.8%, 230 basis points higher than last year. G&A expenses were $109 million, which was consistent with what we previously communicated. G&A as a percent of sales was unfavorable 40 basis points to last year. This unfavorability is primarily driven by higher incentive compensation expense due to the strong growth in sales and EPS for the quarter and wrapping a low incentive accrual in the second quarter of last year. Impairments were 40 basis points unfavorable to last year as we are wrapping on a $9 million gain from the sale of restaurant assets. Interest expense increased 50 basis points versus last year due to the financing expenses related to Ruth's Chris acquisition and the increase in short term debt as the second quarter is typically our peak funding need period for the year. And for the quarter, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 8.1% of sales, 60 basis points better than last year. Looking at our segments, Olive Garden increased total sales by 6.3%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4.1%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 540 basis points. The strength of Never Ending Pasta Bowl contributed to flat same-restaurant guest counts for the quarter, 480 basis points above the industry. This sales growth, along with improved labor productivity and higher pricing related with inflation drove segment profit margin increase of 240 basis points at Olive Garden. At LongHorn, total sales increased 7.1%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4.9%, outperforming the industry by 620 basis points. Segment profit margin of 17.4% was 310 basis points above last year. Pricing leverage, favorable menu mix and improved labor productivity drove LongHorn's strong margin growth this quarter. Total sales at Fine Dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants. Same-restaurant sales at both The Capital Grille and Eddie V's were negative as the Fine Dining category as a whole continues to be challenged year-over-year. This resulted in lower segment profit margin than last year. The other business segment sales increased slightly with the addition of Ruth's Chris franchised and managed location revenue. This was mostly offset by combined negative same-restaurant sales of 1.1% for the brands in the other segment. However, this was still 20 basis points above the industry benchmark. Segment profit margin of 12.9% was 130 basis points better than last year, driven by the additional royalty revenues and pricing relative to inflation. Now, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. We've updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the back half of the year. We now expect total sales of approximately $11.5 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 2.5% to 3%, 50 to 55 new restaurants, capital spending of approximately $600 million, total inflation of 3% to 3.5% including commodities inflation of approximately 2%, an annual effective tax rate of 12% to 12.5%, and approximately 121 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. This results in an increased or adjusted diluted net earnings per share outlook of $8.75 to $8.90. It excludes approximately $55 million of pretax transaction and integration related costs. Looking at the third and fourth quarters, we expect the EPS growth rate to be consistent with what we previously shared. We expect third quarter growth rate to be similar to the first quarter and the fourth quarter to have the lowest EPS growth rate for the year. This is primarily a function of the pricing cadence we communicated at the beginning of the year. We anticipate pricing and inflation to be relatively equal in the third quarter, and we expect to price significantly below inflation in the fourth quarter. So, to wrap up, we continue to be very pleased with how our teams are managing their businesses and delivering strong results. We remain disciplined in adhering to our strategy and we're confident in the strength of our business model. And, with that, we'll take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Jon Tower from Citi. Your line is now live.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. I guess, maybe starting off, I'm curious to get your thoughts. It seems as if obviously the consumer backdrop has weakened a little bit as we've moved here through your fiscal second quarter and perhaps into this fiscal third quarter. And I know obviously Never Ending Pasta Bowl seem to work exceptionally well, driving traffic on a relative basis throughout the quarter. So, I'm curious how you're thinking about promotions for the balance of the year? And I know the Never Ending Pasta Bowl has traditionally been once a year type of timing, but given the weakness we're starting to see broadly across the category, does that alter your thinking either with promotions at Olive Garden or any of the other brands for the balance of fiscal 2024?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, John. Thanks for the question. Nothing that we have seen is altering our plans for the balance of the year. We're really pleased with the performance of our brands. We're right along where we expected to be. And so, we don't anticipate doing anything different.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris Carril from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nChris Carril: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for the question. So, just on the sales outlook, can you maybe comment a little bit more on what drove the change in the comp and revenue outlooks for the year? I know it just changed a little bit, maybe a little narrower toward the lower end of the range, but -- and it's early in the 3Q, but is there anything you're seeing thus far that warrants perhaps a more conservative outlook here?\nRaj Vennam: All right, Chris. Let's start with the guidance at high level. From a sales guide perspective, if you just go back to the time we provided our original guidance, we mentioned that there is -- obviously the consumer background was a little tough but not too -- not terribly bad for us. And we thought if things slow down a little bit, we should expect inflation environment to improve a little bit. And halfway through our fiscal year, that's really the dynamic we're seeing. We've seen some check softness that's being offset by lower inflation, which is why we went to the lower end of our sales range, while increasing our earnings outlook. In fact, if you're looking at our underlying traffic assumption, it still implies flat to slightly negative traffic for the full year. It's really that check is coming down by about 50 basis points. And so, in the grand scheme of things, we're talking about the midpoint moving by 25 basis points from where we started the year. Now, as you look -- to the questionnaire on quarter-to-date in December, we're really only two full weeks into the quarter, and so holidays are still in front of us. And as I think Rick mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're encouraged by the strong holiday bookings we're seeing at our reservation brands. And so, our guidance contemplates everything we know.\nChris Carril: Got it. Thank you. And then, I guess, on pricing, Raj, you did mention some detail in your prepared remarks around pricing, but is there anything else you could add there, maybe perhaps at a brand level, any incremental insight about how you're thinking about pricing here going forward? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Sure, Chris. I'll say -- let's start with our pricing. I think, we mentioned at the beginning of the year, the pricing carryover from actions last year is about 3% on the full year, and our guidance talks about 3.5% to 4%. So, you can imagine there's not a lot of actions this fiscal year. I can tell you that, for example, at Olive Garden, we haven't taken any pricing this fiscal year. And we don't -- at least at this point, don't expect to take any more -- or any additional action in the near term. And so, as you look at that check growth, check growth is likely going to moderate into mid-2s to -- into the third quarter and closer to 2% in the fourth quarter. That's kind of the assumption we have in here.\nChris Carril: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning. Rick, I wanted to ask about your updated thoughts on delivery. Recently a QSR competitor of yours that's long been against third-party systems has decided to jump on and you seem to be varying further in the opposite direction given you said this morning that you're taking third-party delivery away from Ruth's, and it seems like at this point you could price third-party delivery in a way that would represent a very incremental, profitable transaction, an incremental customer, particularly at Olive Garden. So, can you just refresh us on why this seems to still be off the table as a sales opportunity and profit opportunity?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Brian. Yes, it's still off the table for us. As we mentioned, we eliminated it at Ruth's Chris. And it's not all about the price and the profit, and it is profitable sales growth we're looking for, but it is also the execution of the restaurant, what it does to our teams, and how we can execute our existing to-go business. And we've made investments over the last few years to make that experience even better for our consumer, and we continue to do that. We have had third-party delivery in a few restaurants for quite a while, and the performance in those restaurants isn't significantly different than the ones that don't have it. So, we still feel really confident about our decision to stay out of the third-party delivery. Even if we had to price more to cover that, our consumer would see that as our price, not necessarily the price for delivery. So, as of now, we're still steadfast in our resolve to stay out of third-party delivery.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks for that. And, Raj, as my follow up, you said in your prepared remarks that you anticipate price -- to price significantly below inflation in 4Q. That word significantly perked my ears a little bit. I'm just curious if you could give any color on what you do think price versus costs will be in 4Q?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Brian, I'd say we're looking at somewhere in the 150 to 200 basis point range in the fourth quarter, because we do expect pretty low price in the fourth quarter, and we expect inflation to be a little bit higher. Just for a function of wrap, I think, really on the inflation, the first half of the year benefited from chicken deflation. Chicken is about 8% of our sales, and we don't have that tailwind going into the back half.\nBrian Bittner: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nEric Gonzalez: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. My question is on the other business segment, since your sales growth in the segment was negative for the first time in a few years. So, I'm wondering if you can give us a sense about what's happening within that division, which I know includes Cheddar's. So, I'm wondering if this says something about the low-income consumer, if there's anything else worth calling out with regards to that division?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Let me start with the other segment and maybe I'll turn it over to Rick to talk about the consumer in general. So, let's start. When we look at our other segment, we're actually pretty happy with the performance overall when you look at the business as a total topline and bottom line, because as much as they had negative same-restaurant sales, they were still above the industry by 20 basis points as a segment. Now, there is -- there -- I don't want to get into exactly the details, but there are some things on a year-over-year dynamics, especially at one of our southeast brands that's primarily weather-bound and patio related, all that stuff, we don't want to get into those. But, by the way, when we look at traffic for the quarter at the other segment, it was actually very strong at north of 100 basis points gap to the industry positive gap. So, we feel really good about that. And then other segment was also more profitable this quarter. Even when you exclude the franchise income from Ruth's, their segment profit was higher than last year. So, I'd say, all-in-all, that's a pretty good outcome. And then, I'll have Rick talk about consumer.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Eric. And I just want to reiterate, we're really pleased with the performance of our other segment and all of our segments. Profitable sales growth is what we shoot for, and they all had profitable sales growth. Some might have been negative comp, but we still grew. But on the consumer overall, the consumer still continues to appear both resilient, but a little bit more selective as we've talked about in our check and we've seen that for a couple of quarters. Our data shows we're gradually moving back to our pre-COVID demographic mix, which -- with a bigger change in Q2 and moving back to pre-COVID demographics gets us to feel like we're getting closer to what normal is. I will say, we had, across all of our segments, household incomes above $200,000 are higher mix than last year, but still below pre-COVID levels. And incomes below $75,000 are under last year, but still above pre-COVID levels. And the biggest drop was those under $50,000. And this shift was most pronounced, interestingly, in our Fine Dining segment. And last thing, for those under 65 years old -- over, I'm sorry, over 65 years old, their frequency has grown from prior quarters and their dining is shifting a little bit more to lunch. So, that gives you a little bit of a check mix there, too. So -- but, again, what does that mean for us? What does that mean for the brands that we have? We believe that operators can deliver on their brand promise, which we've said before, and value will continue to appeal to consumers. I'm confident we're well positioned and prepared for what we have to deal with, thanks to the breadth of our portfolio and our astounding team members and what they do every day to create exceptional experiences for our guests.\nEric Gonzalez: That's really helpful. And as a follow up, while we're on the topic of the smaller divisions, can you maybe comment on Fine Dining and talk about whether are we out of the woods when it -- as it relates to the abnormal seasonality and the post-COVID lapse? Should we start to see positive comps in the back half in that part of the business?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. So, from a Fine Dining perspective, if you recall, we talked about seasonality trends normalizing and we talked about last year. There was some exuberance in the summer months that kind of continued into the fall a little bit. And so, as we look at where we are this quarter, we actually ended the quarter with positive same-restaurant sales in November. And with -- as Rick mentioned on his -- in his prepared remarks about record Thanksgiving sales, all of our Fine Dining brands and reservation brands had record Thanksgiving sales. So, November was an improvement. If you look at Fine Dining segment in general, is also where we're seeing the most negative check mix year-over-year, and it's really driven by alcohol. Now, I'll tell you that we are -- the preference for alcohol today is actually consistent with where it was pre-COVID, just that last year was a lot higher. And so, we are -- year-over-year, that's a pretty big drag. In fact, I think our Fine Dining mix is almost negative 200 basis points, and that's really one of the things we've noticed. Now, as we get into the holidays and pass, some of that should abate, because we started to see this dynamic in our fiscal Q4 last year. And then last point I'll make is, as Rick mentioned, we are encouraged to see strong bookings in both reservations and private events going into the holidays.\nEric Gonzalez: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Rick, does the early access to Never Ending Pasta Bowl for eClub members this quarter leave you encouraged to lean more into the 15 million or so Olive Garden eClub member database in the back half of the year, recognizing this won't be an avenue for discounting, obviously, as you're focused on profitable growth. Or is it that it was an immaterial impact just for that extra week of early access in the quarter?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Andrew. It wasn't a huge impact for early access, but it was something that delighted our eClub users, right. So, they got something that no one else can get. And so, we'll continue to find ways to talk to them, to give them benefits of being part of the eClub without necessarily having to discount. And so, that's what we continue to look at. And that was the -- one of the first tries at it. We were encouraged by the results there, but we'll continue to look for other ways to use that eClub.\nAndrew Charles: Great. And then, Raj, just curious, with the inflation guidance, how does that break down between COGS and labor as we think about the back half of the year?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. I'd say on the COGS front, as we said, we're basically looking at 2% for the full year approximately, which means back half is closer to 3%, 2.5% to 3%, Q1 being a little bit lower, Q4 being the highest in terms of food inflation. Again, it's a function of wrap on contracts and all that stuff. Not necessarily saying the absolute prices are going up, it's just the fact that what we're wrapping on year-over-year. From a labor perspective, our annual is around 5%. As you saw, from first quarter to second quarter we saw a slight moderation of about 50 basis points in total labor inflation. We are not projecting significant further moderation, but it's -- to the extent there is some that would be -- we'd welcome that, but at this point we're assuming it's closer to that 5% for the back half for labor.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.\nBrian Harbour: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Raj, just on your comment about maybe a little bit lower check versus what you'd previously expected, is that specific to any brand? Is it more than non-Olive Garden brands or is it something you're seeing in Olive Garden as well?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Look, I think, we've talked about it's kind of continuation of what we saw a little bit in the first quarter where we talked about, at our casual brands, we're seeing about 50 basis points of negative mix in general and mostly driven by alcohol. So, when you think about check growth in the mid-single digits, 50 basis points is not a huge -- is not as big as it used to be. It would be -- in a normal environment, when you're talking about a 2% check growth, we would say, oh, 50 is a big deal, but when you're talking about closer to mid-single digit check growth, 50 basis points is not as big, so from that perspective. But, also, as I\u2019ve said earlier, the bigger drag is from Fine Dining, which, as we get into Q4, should abate. But, right now, that's another factor that we didn't necessarily anticipate the level of check mix going into the fiscal year. But traffic is -- again, as I said, we focus more on what's happening with traffic. And to the extent we can say six months into the year that our traffic is similar to the levels we thought at the beginning of the year, that's a great place to be.\nBrian Harbour: Okay. Yes, it makes sense. And just a question on the food cost side as well. Were there any specific items that have kind of come in more favorable than you expected, or is there also maybe just kind of some scale benefits that you've been able to lean to recently?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. I think, as I said in my remarks, pretty much all categories except beef came in a little bit better than we thought. We are -- we did further up, just negotiate a contract for chicken that now we're locked in for the rest of the year basically at 90%, and that's going to be low single digit inflation for the back half, which is something we can deal with. And from other items, seafood continues to be deflationary. And then produce was a little bit better than we thought. Going into the year, we thought there was going to be some challenges with produce based on just some of the contracts we had, but our team was able to go back to our partners and negotiate given the environment and the market, and that was favorable to us from what we thought six months ago or three months ago.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now live.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Rick, I think you mentioned to an earlier question that there was no change in your second half promotional plans. Things seem to be going as expected. I'm just wondering if you could talk about the broader competitive behavior across casual dining. I think, there are some that are incrementally concerned of an uptick in promotions and discounting to drive traffic, kind of in conjunction with the industry, maybe seeing some softening sales trends, especially if commodities continue to ease. So, can you just talk about, again, beyond just your plans, what you're seeing across broader casual dining in terms of that outlook? And then I had one follow up.\nRick Cardenas: Jeff, we're seeing what you see, an increase in television advertising, sometimes at a discount. But we're, as I said, focused on profitable sales growth. Even with the increase in competitive activity we saw in Q2, we exceeded the industry by 410 basis points and that was -- which was the same as second quarter. We exceeded by 410 in the second quarter, I'm sorry last quarter as well. This is on top of the 370 basis point gap we had last year. So, we feel like what we're doing is working, even with competitive and a little bit of an increase in competitive intensity. By the way, we also improved our segment profit margin by 230 basis points from last year. And so, we're going to stick to our strategy, providing everyday value to our guests, and continue to use our filters, which we've talked about many times, to evaluate any marketing activity.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Understood. And then, Raj, the fiscal 2024 guidance, the openings halfway through the year were actually tweaked higher, which is somewhat unusual. I feel like the past few years, if there was going to be a change in opening plans, it was to tweak lower. So, I'm wondering if you could talk maybe about what the driver of that is? I think some have heard of improvement in maybe speed of permitting and construction, or maybe you're just seeing lower build costs, so you're kind of accelerating your plans or better real estate availability. Anything to talk about in terms of that uptick in the unit openings as it pertains to the broader industry? I assume that's the reason for the CapEx uptick as well. But any color you can provide on that would be great. Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Sure. Jeff. Let me start with the comment around the uptick in the openings for the year. We were able to open some restaurants that we thought would be after the holidays, before the holidays. And, frankly, I think our team was a little burned. We got burned the last two years in terms of having some rosy projections. And so, we probably were a little bit more conservative in terms of how we thought about the timeline. That was built based on the actuals last two years. And so, that timeline is getting a little bit better. So, that's helping us deliver a little bit more, and that's really what's showing up. Look, our focus is continuing to want to grow, but cost effectively. We are going to focus on balancing the two, and so -- and our teams understand that and we're working towards that. And to your point about CapEx, yes, that CapEx is driven by the uptick in the NROs.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Joshua Long from Stephens. Your line is now live.\nJoshua Long: Great. Thank you so much. I was curious if we could dig into the segment profitability trends. Impressive to see the consistency there and -- particularly on the LongHorn side, but at Olive Garden as well just given a lot of the pushes and pulls. When you think about the second half of this year, are there particular areas? I know the back-to-basics approach really touches on kind of a holistic approach to the business, but any particular areas that you've been impressed with and/or are driving the majority of kind of the strengthened segment profit margin trends that you've been putting up?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. I'd say, look, the biggest growth in the segment profit this year is really coming from COGS, which was a big unfavorability over the last two years. So, we're starting to -- kind of as commodities moderate, that's really drive -- helping drive food costs get better on a year-over-year basis. So, that's one of the drivers of segment profit growth. We also talked about the difference in pricing versus inflation. We do have a little bit more pricing versus inflation in the first half. That also helped. But, I think, if you look at overall segment profits, as we got to fourth quarter of last year, it was very strong. I think at the Darden level, we were over 20%. And so, we are -- we had some -- we felt like there was probably more opportunity to get a little bit more in the first half than the back half. But, in general, all of our segments, all of our teams are focused on the right things. One of the things we talked about at the beginning of the year with our teams is focusing on controlling what we can control and our teams rally around that and focused on managing our costs better. And that's showing throughout the P&L. And so, there's no one specific thing I would pick on. In general, we're very happy with the progress our teams have made, and we'll continue to be disciplined.\nJoshua Long: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is now live.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I did just want to come back to the conversation around development and construction costs. Could you just give us an update on where the individual construction costs are coming in? Are they coming in lower than you guys are expected in line? How's that trajectory? And then just more broadly, what are you seeing from independence? Are you seeing more of a willingness to build more units? Are you seeing more restaurant formation out there? Or is it kind of more of the same that you've been seeing over the past several quarters? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Let me start with the costs. Costs in general on the development are in line with where we thought on average. We obviously have some unique deals, one-offs here and there where the costs are coming in more than we thought. But going into this year, we had embedded some higher costs into the openings based on the experience we have had over the last couple of years. And so, what I would say at this point is, we believe that the inflation has peaked. And we are -- we may have said this last call, too, we are starting to receive more bids that are kind of in line with our projected -- our project budgets. And so, that's a good thing. From an independent standpoint, I think it's hard for us, the data that we're seeing, to say that there's actually lot of excitement from independence on building new restaurants, given the way the interest rate environment is. So, the financing costs have gone up. And, in fact, to some extent that's also impacting some developers from what we hear. So, the macro -- you guys know the macro better than I do. But I would say, overall, we're still happy with our overall development, the number of restaurants we're opening and how we're thinking about it. And as I mentioned in my prior comments earlier today about we're going to cost effectively build our -- build these restaurants. That's the focus. We want to get growth, but we're going to do it cost effectively.\nPeter Saleh: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. A question on labor productivity. You guys have done a great job there. It looks like labor cost per unit was up maybe 2%, a little bit over that in the quarter, versus up a little over 5% in the first quarter. I think, you said wage increase was roughly 5% in both quarters. So, if I'm hearing that right, is labor hours down a few percent in fiscal 2Q? And if so, could you clarify maybe what are some of the drivers of that productivity?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, David. Yes. We've had a history of discipline and improvement in productivity enhancements. This year is no different. We're getting more of it, because we've had lower turnover than we've had over the last few years. We're still investing in training to get those team members up to speed quicker. We also are spending training dollars on getting our existing team members even more productive. So, our productivity enhancements were the difference between our wage inflation and our labor inflation. I will also say our teams continue to get better with forecasting our business. We've added some AI tools to their tool belt to be able to forecast their restaurant business by -- in 15 minutes increments, even better than they did before, and we're seeing added benefit, as I said, from lower turnover.\nDavid Palmer: That's great. Are you thinking that that sort of labor productivity should continue in the second half? And, I guess, related to that, I wonder what you're thinking about California, and with the minimum wages coming in April -- is that -- how does that affect the wage or the total labor outlook for you? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. David, our total labor outlook isn't that -- necessarily that different than where it's been in the first half of the year. I think, we're still having wage inflations at around the mid-single digits, which is pretty much back to pre-COVID levels. We do anticipate that as turnover continues to tick down, which we expect it should, to get us closer to pre-COVID levels. That will continue to have some productivity enhancements. In regards to the FAST Act in California, we're monitoring that. Everything that we have contemplated is contemplated in our guidance. I will say we have an amazing employment proposition and across all of our states and all of our brands, but in California, an even better employment proposition. Our turnover is lower in California than it is in most places and our wages are higher. So, we feel pretty confident that we're okay in California. But if something changes, we'll react to it.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your line is now live.\nSara Senatore: Great. Thank you. One question and then a follow up, please. So, just on the price versus inflation, I guess historically you've priced below inflation and you've seen traffic gains as a result. Is your expectation that as the gap between your pricing and your -- and the inflation kind of reverses over the course of the second half, so inflation ahead of pricing that you might see acceleration in traffic. I know that you're already gapping out positively versus the industry, but I think historically there's been -- either coincidentally or not kind of 500 basis point gap in traffic and also in your pricing. So, I guess, that's the first question around as you're thinking about that trade off kind of margin traffic? And then I have a quick follow up.\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Sarah. So let me start with just grounding us on where we are with respect to pricing over the last four years. If you think about our price for the last four years, our pricing has basically been around -- at the Darden level has been closer to 17% cumulatively, just under 17%. For the same time frame, if you look at where full-service restaurant CPI is, that's 24%. So, we have basically created a gap of 700 basis points to full-service restaurant CPI over that time, in the four years cumulatively. In fact, if you look at limited service, they're at 29%. So, that's a 1,200 basis point gap to them. So, over the last four years, we've been very prudent, and we've talked about it multiple times about how we're going to price very thoughtfully and deliberately and wanted to make sure we're creating this gap. And, by the way, that overall pricing we have is below the overall CPI over that time frame by 300 basis points. So, from all aspects, we've actually stuck to our strategy of pricing below inflation, which is one of the drivers of our traffic outperformance. But I would say the other big driver is the execution, consistently executing and providing the greatest experience we can to our guests, and that's what our teams are focused on. That combined with the strategy of pricing under inflation is what we believe helps us separate ourselves from the industry, and we'll continue to do that.\nSara Senatore: Understood. I guess, to your point, just thinking about sort of cumulatively, it will look a little different in the fourth quarter, I think, than in the first quarter. But it sounds like you're not expecting a big swing in sort of that traffic even as sequentially the relative value versus inflation might change a little bit. And then, I have a question on just trying to piece together everything you said about like the different income cohorts. So, you're not quite back up in terms of the high income as a percentage of your customer base to where you were in COVID, pre-COVID, but you're there, you're getting closer, but at the same time you're seeing check management. So, I guess, can you just put maybe a finer point on it? So, is the check management coming from lower income cohorts or the higher income cohort? And it sounds like some of this is just -- lower income cohorts may have splurged more in the past and now you're kind of getting back to normal patterns, but I'm trying to piece everything together. Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Sarah. The check management in Fine Dining is coming more from the lower income cohorts than it is from the higher income cohorts. I think, they were splurging, as we've talked about before, a little bit of euphoria in the last few years, and we're getting back to a more normal level. And in regards to pricing, your point on the follow up, recall, Raj said we don't really have a whole lot of pricing in the back half. Most of what we have is wrap. So, when you think about how much pricing we have versus inflation, most of our pricing is already embedded. And so, that's really where the delta is. So, the consumer isn't going to see a whole lot more price than they are seeing today. They might see a little bit in a couple of brands. So, we still feel really good about where we are, and we don't think it's going to really make a big change in our traffic patterns.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your line is now live.\nPatrick Johnson: Thanks. Good morning, guys. This is Patrick on for Chris. But, Raj, I was curious on the traffic at LongHorn, if you could just dig into that a little bit more, whether relative to last quarter or relative to the industry? And then also just check management specifically at LongHorn. And are you guys seeing any different trends there than maybe what you mentioned in some of the other segments?\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Patrick. When I look at LongHorn, they had a very strong performance for the quarter, right. We talked about significantly outperformed the industry on same-restaurant sales. Their traffic for the quarter was around negative 1%. That's a -- but when you look at their retention to pre-COVID, they've held up pretty well. They are up both in dining room and off premise by -- combined by double digits in the dining room. So, to have the volumes who are running at LongHorn today, we would have said four years ago it would take 10 years to get there, and we got there in four years. So, we're really happy with where LongHorn is in terms of their momentum, and we hope to see that continue.\nPatrick Johnson: Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, Rick, I was just curious, as you step back from the business, and you think about strategically how you continue to exploit the scale advantages that you have. I mean, what are the biggest opportunities over the next 12 months when you think about potentially competing in a softer environment, what you can leverage? Is it supply chain, is it technology? Or just curious to get your overall thoughts on where some of those opportunities might lie to increase the gap between you and your competitors?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Patrick. I will say, over the next 12 months, pretty kind of -- a little bit short term versus the strategic things that we've been doing over the last few years. But we believe that we continue to invest in technology to make it easier for our teams to execute. As I said, we've got better AI tools for scheduling and if we schedule better, we execute better. That drives performance. Our supply chain scale advantage is pretty strong, and so we're able to get better pricing for our food, which we can pass on to our consumers through lower overall check growth versus the industry. So, there's no one nugget. What I would say is, it's our back-to-basics operating philosophy that's going to continue to get us to grow. And that's excellent food, excellent service and an inviting atmosphere, executing better than the restaurant next door. That's not necessarily strategic, that's not a silver bullet, that's hard to do, and we do it really well. And that's what's really -- as Raj mentioned earlier, execution is what's driving a lot of our performance, and we'll continue to execute by using our scale to help our brands get better.\nPatrick Johnson: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is now live.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks, guys. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more on off premise, what it was in the quarter, and any thoughts on the go-forward there?\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Dennis, off premise for the quarter at Olive Garden was 23%, so pretty similar to the levels we had before. And then LongHorn is at 14%. And, now, we'll get into -- as we get into the holidays, we should see a little bit more at Olive Garden. Typically, we see that, but we'll see how that goes going forward. But on a year-over-year basis, it's slightly below, I think, across our system. We're probably 100 basis points lower or something like that, it's -- but it's pretty -- it's stabilized in these ranges.\nDennis Geiger: That's great. Thanks, Raj. Just one quick one then, just on any regional, and I know you talked a little bit earlier for some of the segments about some regional things to be thinking about, anything broadly across brands, cross portfolio regionally that you've seen?\nRaj Vennam: Nothing of note to talk about. It's fairly consistent with what we mentioned last quarter, where there's a little bit of softness in Texas and South, but not -- nothing crazy. California, a little bit stronger, but nothing meaningful.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Raj.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you. Congrats. I think, you've talked about before, you generally see changes in check before traffic in a more challenging environment. Do you see this check management as a precursor to traffic step down, or more of a return to normal behaviors? How are you monitoring that? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Lauren, this is Rick. We see the check management a little bit more of a function of year-over-year euphoria difference. Not necessarily that the consumer is feeling a lot more pinched. Now, we -- as we said, we're getting closer. The higher income households mix is going up, the below $50,000 is going down, and that's both on the traffic side and a little bit on the check side. So, we're not hugely concerned or we're not really that concerned about the check management now, because it was really more driven by last year versus kind of a long-term trend.\nLauren Silberman: Great. Thank you. And then just a quick one from marketing. The $35 million to $40 million range that you're currently running, is that the right run rate, or should we expect a pickup? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Lauren. I think we've basically said we're going to be within 10 basis points to 20 basis points as a percent of sales versus last year. So, any quarter, you should be -- if you look at last year, and we should be within 10 bps to 20 bps of that.\nLauren Silberman: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Barish: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just one clarification. On the unit side, you used the term reopens. Were those relocated units? And then, I've got one other follow-up question, please.\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Andy, I think it was four. We had a couple of relocations. We had a couple of restaurants that we reopened after being temporary closed due to fires. So, that's really the bulk of those four.\nAndrew Barish: Okay. And just a quick update. Last quarter, you talked about more synergy realization potential at Ruth's Chris, but some of that going to be reinvested. Has that reinvestment started in earnest, or is it more going to come kind of in the back half of the year as supply chain gets integrated and things like that?\nRick Cardenas: Yes. Andy, some of that reinvestments is already starting and some of it happens as the supply chain converts. One of the investments we made was an improvement in [indiscernible]. I don't think that's in every restaurant yet. Another one of the investments that we talked about we will be doing in December, and that is for their team closing on Christmas Day. So, there's still some things that are coming in, but we're consistent, we're on track with our timeline and we still expect accretion to be consistent with what we shared previously. Even with those investments, we're making for our team members and our guests.\nAndrew Barish: Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. Your line is now live.\nGregory Francfort: Hey, thanks for the question. Rick, just one more on marketing. Can you remind us how the composition of that has changed versus pre-COVID, either maybe traditional or digital or other categories? And how you think about the returns across those channels versus a few years ago? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Greg. Yes. Versus pre-COVID, we're a bit more digital, partly because LongHorn really came off of television when we were on -- before COVID LongHorn was on TV. So, we are a bit more digital in overall mix. Olive Garden's mix isn't substantially different than before. They did come off a little bit of television, but they also came off a little bit on the digital side. We have pretty good analytics to tell us the returns on each of those things. And the good news is, during COVID we tested some more digital, and we were able to because we didn't have much media on at one time. When we started turning it on, we were actually able to see what those returns are. And that was one of the benefits of the COVID. We were able to test a little bit more, and we're testing other things on the digital front now to see if there's some things that we'll add in the future.\nGregory Francfort: Thanks for your perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Your line is now live.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one just wanted to follow up on some of the value perception, I guess commentary that you made, certainly relative to other restaurants and certainly relative to inflation, makes a lot of sense. But I guess when you broaden the view on that and look at food at home or grocery, and you see some of the larger grocery chains talking about food deflation and more promotions and things like that, does that factor into your calculus at all, or how do you think about the value perception relative to that? If you have any work on that or anything -- any thoughts would be great?\nRick Cardenas: A couple of things. As we've mentioned before, dining out is really more than just about the sustenance. It's about getting together with your family and friends to enjoy a meal. And, as Raj mentioned earlier, we still have a very big gap in the pricing that we have taken over the last four years versus what's happening in retail. I mean, I would say, if retail starts to do discounts or other deals, it's probably because they're not moving product. And so, that helps us on the -- on our cost side. So, we don't really look very much at the difference between food at home and food away from home, partly because, as I said, people think about, I want to go out to eat, and then they determine where they want to go out to eat. And so, we haven't really seen correlations in the difference in food at home, food away from home over the long, long term.\nAndrew Strelzik: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just one other question, on the Ruth's integration, any surprises or learnings as that's progressed? And, I guess, the balance sheet still is in very, very good shape. So, would that integration either preclude you from making another acquisition, or how are you thinking about the balance sheet from here? Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Let me start by saying we're really pleased with the integration and the transition that we've had. We're six months from the close of the transaction. We still have a few changes we have to make at the restaurants, and they have to absorb them over this next six months. But that doesn't preclude us from other things. And we'll continue to talk to our Board and determine what the right use of our capital is. As you mentioned, we do have a strong balance sheet, but we're going to continue to work on this until something else comes along.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you so much. At first, I was hoping maybe you could help a little bit with industry comparisons in January and February. Obviously, COVID lapse from the previous year helped, but also an unusually warmer, really lack of winter. I mean, I guess, if you were to kind of normalize those months, I mean, how much do you think you may have actually kind of been helped by kind of a bounce back in the early months of 2023 that we should at least consider on a lapping perspective. I know it's very tactical and it's not my style, but I would love to know your perspective on that. And then secondly, my experience is that casual dining operating companies don't love presidential election years, cost of media breaking through, disruption of consumers what have you. I mean do you share that perspective and is there anything that we should be just kind of considering as we kind of go into calendar 2024, what is obviously going to be another difficult election cycle? Thank you so much.\nRaj Vennam: All right, John. Let me try to answer in a way that I make sense, because, obviously, when you look at the seasonal situation, third quarter last year was wrapping on Omicron from the year before. It was just a whole different in terms of dynamic. But as you pointed out, the weather -- the winter weather in that quarter for us, third quarter, which is December, January, February in aggregate was favorable to five year -- to the historical averages. And so we do expect winter weather in the third quarter to be essentially a headwind in the Q3 just based on historical averages. If the weather this year is anything like what it would have been historically that it is a headwind for us. I would expect it's the same for the industry, but I can't -- I don't want to speak confidently about the industry, but I can tell you that's how we are looking at it. In fact, we -- that's part of the reason, we didn't get into this earlier, but that's part of the reason our internal estimates have comps, the same restaurant sales for the Q3 being the lowest for the fiscal -- within this year, primarily because of that weather headwind. And now, I'll have -- maybe Rick can talk about the presidential years and how we think about it.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, John. Yes, this is an election year. It's probably going to be a pretty contentious election, with a lot of television advertising. The good news is, we're not as reliant on TV as we were in the past. And I think casual dining was much more reliant on television in the past, and chain restaurants were much more reliant on television, but now there's other media out there, more digital, more online video. And so, we aren't as concerned about an election year as maybe in the past. That said, it depends on how contentious this gets and how much media is out there. We feel confident that if we continue to focus on our strategies and execute, when people go out, they're going to come out to our restaurants.\nJohn Ivankoe: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Your line is now live.\nBrian Vaccaro: Hi. Just a quick one from me. Thank you. Following up on your private dining bookings comments, could you help frame the degree to which you're up year-on-year or any perspective on how that might compare looking back to pre-COVID levels? Thank you.\nRaj Vennam: Yes. Brian, we're not going to talk about how much we're up in this current quarter on private dining year-over-year, so we'll let you know how that happens after the quarter ends.\nBrian Vaccaro: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Nick Setyan from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now live.\nNick Setyan: Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the pricing below inflation in Q4. Historically, you've always priced below inflation. I guess, is there really a big change in terms of the magnitude of the pricing below inflation? And then beyond Q4, is -- are there enough operating initiatives to kind of maintain four wall margins? Or are you willing to give up some margin in the medium term?\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Nick. I think part of this is really the cadence of when we took pricing actions. So if you recall at the beginning of the year, we were very clear that we're going to have on a year-over-year basis, we're going to see more pricing come through in the first half than the back half, just because that's the function of actions we took last year. There is not a lot of new pricing actions we're taking this year. There are few and that's why instead of the 3% of the 3.5% to 4% that we have in total pricing is carryover from last year. So there are few actions this year. Typically, we tied it to our team, we typically take pricing with our fiscal year. So now things can change, but the way we look at it is, we take a longer term view and we've been very clear on the year that we are getting some margin growth. Our guidance implies margin growth. And I'll then refer you back to our long term framework, which kind of talks about over time we expect to grow margins. Any given quarter do we give up margins? Yes, maybe, if that's the right thing for the year. I mean, at the end of the day we look at over longer periods of time.\nNick Setyan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question today is coming from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your line is now live.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Thank you. Raj, I want to build on the -- last statement that you made on the margin expansion over time. So if we think about kind of the long run, and given the solid results that you already had in the restaurant level margins, can you help us understand the path for the incremental margin expansion? Meaning, why do you see the biggest upside over the long run as you continue to scale?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Danilo, this is Rick. You think about our margin, we've been fairly consistent over the years that we are searching for profitable sales growth and we have -- we had just updated our long term framework, we put that back out, where we'd be at 10 to 30 basis points a year in margin expansion, and any one year it could be above that or below that and we are going to get that through executing our strategy, leveraging our scale to be able to take cost out of the system and still over in a long term price below inflation to provide a better dining experience using our back to basics operating philosophy and our great operators out in the field that execute better than the restaurant next door. If we do those things and we have done those things, we will continue to drive profitable sales growth. There may be years that our margins are little bit less than that because we're gaining even more market share, and we're willing to do that. There may be years on the opposite side where we still gain share, but we have margin expansion opportunities. As Raj mentioned, we don't look at it quarter-to-quarter. We think about it over the long run.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Thank you. And then can you comment on the technology road map, and what excites you the most about it? You recently mentioned about kind of the AI implementation to improve the level of staffing in the stores. What do you think is going to be unfolding in the next few years? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Danilo. Over the last few years, we've focused a lot of energy and technology on improving the guest experience, primarily in the off premise segment, making it easier to order, pick up and pay. We're working on our tech plans for the next few years, but I would think that AI would be a little bit more part of that, especially on the back of the house things, maybe not necessarily as consumer facing. Our goal with technology is to eliminate friction, and we've eliminated a lot of friction for the guest on the to go experience on being able to put their name on waitlist. Now we want to eliminate friction in our team, eliminate our management friction to make it easier for them. So they don't have to spend as much time doing what we think are non-value added tasks, ordering, receiving, scheduling, which is value added, but if we can make it easier for them to schedule, they can spend less time doing that and spend a lot more time with their team and with their guests. And so, the technology investments we're making -- we may be making in the future, you might not see a whole lot of impact on that from the consumer. You will see it from the consumer because our teams are going to be better trained and so that's what we are focusing on.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Thank you. [indiscernible]\nOperator: Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you. That concludes our call. Remind you that we plan to release third quarter results on Thursday, March 21 before the market opens with a conference call to follow. Thanks again for your participation and have a happy holiday.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Raj Vennam",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick. And good morning, everyone. Our teams did a great job managing their businesses again this quarter, resulting in meaningful restaurant level and total margin growth. This margin growth was driven by positive same-restaurant sales growth, strong labor management and lower than anticipated restaurant and commodities' expenses. We generated $2.7 billion of total sales for the second quarter, 9.7% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 78 company-owned Ruth's Chris Steak House restaurants, 45 legacy Darden new restaurants, and same-restaurant sales growth of 2.8%. Our same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 410 basis points and same-restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 370 basis points. Our focus on managing the business and controlling costs resulted in adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.84 in the second quarter, an increase of 21% from last year's reported earnings per share. We generated $403 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $340 million of capital to our shareholders through $158 million in dividends and $181 million of share repurchases. Now, looking at our adjusted margin analysis compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 190 basis points better, driven by pricing leverage. Total commodities inflation was flat to prior year for the quarter and slightly better than our expectations, while beef inflation continues to track in line with our expectations, most other categories are seeing some favorability. Restaurant labor was 20 basis points better than last year, driven by productivity improvements at our brands as pricing and inflation were roughly equal at 5%. Restaurant expenses were 30 basis points favorable, primarily due to lower workers' compensation expense and deflation in utilities. Marketing expenses were 10 basis points higher than last year, consistent with our expectations. All of these factors resulted in restaurant level EBITDA of 18.8%, 230 basis points higher than last year. G&A expenses were $109 million, which was consistent with what we previously communicated. G&A as a percent of sales was unfavorable 40 basis points to last year. This unfavorability is primarily driven by higher incentive compensation expense due to the strong growth in sales and EPS for the quarter and wrapping a low incentive accrual in the second quarter of last year. Impairments were 40 basis points unfavorable to last year as we are wrapping on a $9 million gain from the sale of restaurant assets. Interest expense increased 50 basis points versus last year due to the financing expenses related to Ruth's Chris acquisition and the increase in short term debt as the second quarter is typically our peak funding need period for the year. And for the quarter, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 8.1% of sales, 60 basis points better than last year. Looking at our segments, Olive Garden increased total sales by 6.3%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4.1%, outperforming the industry benchmark by 540 basis points. The strength of Never Ending Pasta Bowl contributed to flat same-restaurant guest counts for the quarter, 480 basis points above the industry. This sales growth, along with improved labor productivity and higher pricing related with inflation drove segment profit margin increase of 240 basis points at Olive Garden. At LongHorn, total sales increased 7.1%, driven by same-restaurant sales growth of 4.9%, outperforming the industry by 620 basis points. Segment profit margin of 17.4% was 310 basis points above last year. Pricing leverage, favorable menu mix and improved labor productivity drove LongHorn's strong margin growth this quarter. Total sales at Fine Dining segment increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants. Same-restaurant sales at both The Capital Grille and Eddie V's were negative as the Fine Dining category as a whole continues to be challenged year-over-year. This resulted in lower segment profit margin than last year. The other business segment sales increased slightly with the addition of Ruth's Chris franchised and managed location revenue. This was mostly offset by combined negative same-restaurant sales of 1.1% for the brands in the other segment. However, this was still 20 basis points above the industry benchmark. Segment profit margin of 12.9% was 130 basis points better than last year, driven by the additional royalty revenues and pricing relative to inflation. Now, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. We've updated our guidance to reflect our year-to-date results and expectations for the back half of the year. We now expect total sales of approximately $11.5 billion, same-restaurant sales growth of 2.5% to 3%, 50 to 55 new restaurants, capital spending of approximately $600 million, total inflation of 3% to 3.5% including commodities inflation of approximately 2%, an annual effective tax rate of 12% to 12.5%, and approximately 121 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. This results in an increased or adjusted diluted net earnings per share outlook of $8.75 to $8.90. It excludes approximately $55 million of pretax transaction and integration related costs. Looking at the third and fourth quarters, we expect the EPS growth rate to be consistent with what we previously shared. We expect third quarter growth rate to be similar to the first quarter and the fourth quarter to have the lowest EPS growth rate for the year. This is primarily a function of the pricing cadence we communicated at the beginning of the year. We anticipate pricing and inflation to be relatively equal in the third quarter, and we expect to price significantly below inflation in the fourth quarter. So, to wrap up, we continue to be very pleased with how our teams are managing their businesses and delivering strong results. We remain disciplined in adhering to our strategy and we're confident in the strength of our business model. And, with that, we'll take your questions. All right, Chris. Let's start with the guidance at high level. From a sales guide perspective, if you just go back to the time we provided our original guidance, we mentioned that there is -- obviously the consumer background was a little tough but not too -- not terribly bad for us. And we thought if things slow down a little bit, we should expect inflation environment to improve a little bit. And halfway through our fiscal year, that's really the dynamic we're seeing. We've seen some check softness that's being offset by lower inflation, which is why we went to the lower end of our sales range, while increasing our earnings outlook. In fact, if you're looking at our underlying traffic assumption, it still implies flat to slightly negative traffic for the full year. It's really that check is coming down by about 50 basis points. And so, in the grand scheme of things, we're talking about the midpoint moving by 25 basis points from where we started the year. Now, as you look -- to the questionnaire on quarter-to-date in December, we're really only two full weeks into the quarter, and so holidays are still in front of us. And as I think Rick mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're encouraged by the strong holiday bookings we're seeing at our reservation brands. And so, our guidance contemplates everything we know. Sure, Chris. I'll say -- let's start with our pricing. I think, we mentioned at the beginning of the year, the pricing carryover from actions last year is about 3% on the full year, and our guidance talks about 3.5% to 4%. So, you can imagine there's not a lot of actions this fiscal year. I can tell you that, for example, at Olive Garden, we haven't taken any pricing this fiscal year. And we don't -- at least at this point, don't expect to take any more -- or any additional action in the near term. And so, as you look at that check growth, check growth is likely going to moderate into mid-2s to -- into the third quarter and closer to 2% in the fourth quarter. That's kind of the assumption we have in here. Yes. Brian, I'd say we're looking at somewhere in the 150 to 200 basis point range in the fourth quarter, because we do expect pretty low price in the fourth quarter, and we expect inflation to be a little bit higher. Just for a function of wrap, I think, really on the inflation, the first half of the year benefited from chicken deflation. Chicken is about 8% of our sales, and we don't have that tailwind going into the back half. Yes. Let me start with the other segment and maybe I'll turn it over to Rick to talk about the consumer in general. So, let's start. When we look at our other segment, we're actually pretty happy with the performance overall when you look at the business as a total topline and bottom line, because as much as they had negative same-restaurant sales, they were still above the industry by 20 basis points as a segment. Now, there is -- there -- I don't want to get into exactly the details, but there are some things on a year-over-year dynamics, especially at one of our southeast brands that's primarily weather-bound and patio related, all that stuff, we don't want to get into those. But, by the way, when we look at traffic for the quarter at the other segment, it was actually very strong at north of 100 basis points gap to the industry positive gap. So, we feel really good about that. And then other segment was also more profitable this quarter. Even when you exclude the franchise income from Ruth's, their segment profit was higher than last year. So, I'd say, all-in-all, that's a pretty good outcome. And then, I'll have Rick talk about consumer. Yeah. So, from a Fine Dining perspective, if you recall, we talked about seasonality trends normalizing and we talked about last year. There was some exuberance in the summer months that kind of continued into the fall a little bit. And so, as we look at where we are this quarter, we actually ended the quarter with positive same-restaurant sales in November. And with -- as Rick mentioned on his -- in his prepared remarks about record Thanksgiving sales, all of our Fine Dining brands and reservation brands had record Thanksgiving sales. So, November was an improvement. If you look at Fine Dining segment in general, is also where we're seeing the most negative check mix year-over-year, and it's really driven by alcohol. Now, I'll tell you that we are -- the preference for alcohol today is actually consistent with where it was pre-COVID, just that last year was a lot higher. And so, we are -- year-over-year, that's a pretty big drag. In fact, I think our Fine Dining mix is almost negative 200 basis points, and that's really one of the things we've noticed. Now, as we get into the holidays and pass, some of that should abate, because we started to see this dynamic in our fiscal Q4 last year. And then last point I'll make is, as Rick mentioned, we are encouraged to see strong bookings in both reservations and private events going into the holidays. Yes. I'd say on the COGS front, as we said, we're basically looking at 2% for the full year approximately, which means back half is closer to 3%, 2.5% to 3%, Q1 being a little bit lower, Q4 being the highest in terms of food inflation. Again, it's a function of wrap on contracts and all that stuff. Not necessarily saying the absolute prices are going up, it's just the fact that what we're wrapping on year-over-year. From a labor perspective, our annual is around 5%. As you saw, from first quarter to second quarter we saw a slight moderation of about 50 basis points in total labor inflation. We are not projecting significant further moderation, but it's -- to the extent there is some that would be -- we'd welcome that, but at this point we're assuming it's closer to that 5% for the back half for labor. Yes. Look, I think, we've talked about it's kind of continuation of what we saw a little bit in the first quarter where we talked about, at our casual brands, we're seeing about 50 basis points of negative mix in general and mostly driven by alcohol. So, when you think about check growth in the mid-single digits, 50 basis points is not a huge -- is not as big as it used to be. It would be -- in a normal environment, when you're talking about a 2% check growth, we would say, oh, 50 is a big deal, but when you're talking about closer to mid-single digit check growth, 50 basis points is not as big, so from that perspective. But, also, as I've said earlier, the bigger drag is from Fine Dining, which, as we get into Q4, should abate. But, right now, that's another factor that we didn't necessarily anticipate the level of check mix going into the fiscal year. But traffic is -- again, as I said, we focus more on what's happening with traffic. And to the extent we can say six months into the year that our traffic is similar to the levels we thought at the beginning of the year, that's a great place to be. Yes. I think, as I said in my remarks, pretty much all categories except beef came in a little bit better than we thought. We are -- we did further up, just negotiate a contract for chicken that now we're locked in for the rest of the year basically at 90%, and that's going to be low single digit inflation for the back half, which is something we can deal with. And from other items, seafood continues to be deflationary. And then produce was a little bit better than we thought. Going into the year, we thought there was going to be some challenges with produce based on just some of the contracts we had, but our team was able to go back to our partners and negotiate given the environment and the market, and that was favorable to us from what we thought six months ago or three months ago. Sure. Jeff. Let me start with the comment around the uptick in the openings for the year. We were able to open some restaurants that we thought would be after the holidays, before the holidays. And, frankly, I think our team was a little burned. We got burned the last two years in terms of having some rosy projections. And so, we probably were a little bit more conservative in terms of how we thought about the timeline. That was built based on the actuals last two years. And so, that timeline is getting a little bit better. So, that's helping us deliver a little bit more, and that's really what's showing up. Look, our focus is continuing to want to grow, but cost effectively. We are going to focus on balancing the two, and so -- and our teams understand that and we're working towards that. And to your point about CapEx, yes, that CapEx is driven by the uptick in the NROs. Yes. I'd say, look, the biggest growth in the segment profit this year is really coming from COGS, which was a big unfavorability over the last two years. So, we're starting to -- kind of as commodities moderate, that's really drive -- helping drive food costs get better on a year-over-year basis. So, that's one of the drivers of segment profit growth. We also talked about the difference in pricing versus inflation. We do have a little bit more pricing versus inflation in the first half. That also helped. But, I think, if you look at overall segment profits, as we got to fourth quarter of last year, it was very strong. I think at the Darden level, we were over 20%. And so, we are -- we had some -- we felt like there was probably more opportunity to get a little bit more in the first half than the back half. But, in general, all of our segments, all of our teams are focused on the right things. One of the things we talked about at the beginning of the year with our teams is focusing on controlling what we can control and our teams rally around that and focused on managing our costs better. And that's showing throughout the P&L. And so, there's no one specific thing I would pick on. In general, we're very happy with the progress our teams have made, and we'll continue to be disciplined. Yes. Let me start with the costs. Costs in general on the development are in line with where we thought on average. We obviously have some unique deals, one-offs here and there where the costs are coming in more than we thought. But going into this year, we had embedded some higher costs into the openings based on the experience we have had over the last couple of years. And so, what I would say at this point is, we believe that the inflation has peaked. And we are -- we may have said this last call, too, we are starting to receive more bids that are kind of in line with our projected -- our project budgets. And so, that's a good thing. From an independent standpoint, I think it's hard for us, the data that we're seeing, to say that there's actually lot of excitement from independence on building new restaurants, given the way the interest rate environment is. So, the financing costs have gone up. And, in fact, to some extent that's also impacting some developers from what we hear. So, the macro -- you guys know the macro better than I do. But I would say, overall, we're still happy with our overall development, the number of restaurants we're opening and how we're thinking about it. And as I mentioned in my prior comments earlier today about we're going to cost effectively build our -- build these restaurants. That's the focus. We want to get growth, but we're going to do it cost effectively. Hey, Sarah. So let me start with just grounding us on where we are with respect to pricing over the last four years. If you think about our price for the last four years, our pricing has basically been around -- at the Darden level has been closer to 17% cumulatively, just under 17%. For the same time frame, if you look at where full-service restaurant CPI is, that's 24%. So, we have basically created a gap of 700 basis points to full-service restaurant CPI over that time, in the four years cumulatively. In fact, if you look at limited service, they're at 29%. So, that's a 1,200 basis point gap to them. So, over the last four years, we've been very prudent, and we've talked about it multiple times about how we're going to price very thoughtfully and deliberately and wanted to make sure we're creating this gap. And, by the way, that overall pricing we have is below the overall CPI over that time frame by 300 basis points. So, from all aspects, we've actually stuck to our strategy of pricing below inflation, which is one of the drivers of our traffic outperformance. But I would say the other big driver is the execution, consistently executing and providing the greatest experience we can to our guests, and that's what our teams are focused on. That combined with the strategy of pricing under inflation is what we believe helps us separate ourselves from the industry, and we'll continue to do that. Yes, Patrick. When I look at LongHorn, they had a very strong performance for the quarter, right. We talked about significantly outperformed the industry on same-restaurant sales. Their traffic for the quarter was around negative 1%. That's a -- but when you look at their retention to pre-COVID, they've held up pretty well. They are up both in dining room and off premise by -- combined by double digits in the dining room. So, to have the volumes who are running at LongHorn today, we would have said four years ago it would take 10 years to get there, and we got there in four years. So, we're really happy with where LongHorn is in terms of their momentum, and we hope to see that continue. Yes. Dennis, off premise for the quarter at Olive Garden was 23%, so pretty similar to the levels we had before. And then LongHorn is at 14%. And, now, we'll get into -- as we get into the holidays, we should see a little bit more at Olive Garden. Typically, we see that, but we'll see how that goes going forward. But on a year-over-year basis, it's slightly below, I think, across our system. We're probably 100 basis points lower or something like that, it's -- but it's pretty -- it's stabilized in these ranges. Nothing of note to talk about. It's fairly consistent with what we mentioned last quarter, where there's a little bit of softness in Texas and South, but not -- nothing crazy. California, a little bit stronger, but nothing meaningful. Yes, Lauren. I think we've basically said we're going to be within 10 basis points to 20 basis points as a percent of sales versus last year. So, any quarter, you should be -- if you look at last year, and we should be within 10 bps to 20 bps of that. All right, John. Let me try to answer in a way that I make sense, because, obviously, when you look at the seasonal situation, third quarter last year was wrapping on Omicron from the year before. It was just a whole different in terms of dynamic. But as you pointed out, the weather -- the winter weather in that quarter for us, third quarter, which is December, January, February in aggregate was favorable to five year -- to the historical averages. And so we do expect winter weather in the third quarter to be essentially a headwind in the Q3 just based on historical averages. If the weather this year is anything like what it would have been historically that it is a headwind for us. I would expect it's the same for the industry, but I can't -- I don't want to speak confidently about the industry, but I can tell you that's how we are looking at it. In fact, we -- that's part of the reason, we didn't get into this earlier, but that's part of the reason our internal estimates have comps, the same restaurant sales for the Q3 being the lowest for the fiscal -- within this year, primarily because of that weather headwind. And now, I'll have -- maybe Rick can talk about the presidential years and how we think about it. Yes. Brian, we're not going to talk about how much we're up in this current quarter on private dining year-over-year, so we'll let you know how that happens after the quarter ends. Hey, Nick. I think part of this is really the cadence of when we took pricing actions. So if you recall at the beginning of the year, we were very clear that we're going to have on a year-over-year basis, we're going to see more pricing come through in the first half than the back half, just because that's the function of actions we took last year. There is not a lot of new pricing actions we're taking this year. There are few and that's why instead of the 3% of the 3.5% to 4% that we have in total pricing is carryover from last year. So there are few actions this year. Typically, we tied it to our team, we typically take pricing with our fiscal year. So now things can change, but the way we look at it is, we take a longer term view and we've been very clear on the year that we are getting some margin growth. Our guidance implies margin growth. And I'll then refer you back to our long term framework, which kind of talks about over time we expect to grow margins. Any given quarter do we give up margins? Yes, maybe, if that's the right thing for the year. I mean, at the end of the day we look at over longer periods of time."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our results this quarter, which outperformed the industry benchmark for same-restaurant sales and traffic. Total sales were $2.7 billion, an increase of 9.7%, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.84. We opened 17 restaurants during the quarter. Fiscal year to date, we have opened 27 restaurants in 16 states, four of which were re-openings. We continue to stick to our strategy, driven by our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning and a results-oriented culture. And our brands are relentlessly focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere. This focus on being brilliant with the basics enables our brands to consistently perform at a high level. Our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain strong across all of our brands. In fact, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze reached all-time highs for overall guest satisfaction during the quarter. LongHorn also ranked number one among major casual dining brands in six of the seven key measurement categories within Technomic's industry tracking tool, including food, service, atmosphere and value. LongHorn's continued adherence to their strategy is driving strong execution, which can also be seen in the fact that they established an all-time high stakes grilled correctly score. During the quarter, Olive Garden ran Never Ending Pasta Bowl. It was offered at the same price point as last year, making it an even stronger value. Guest demand was higher this year and our restaurant teams did a great job delivering outstanding guest experiences, achieving the highest refill rate ever. This performance was driven by our focus on ensuring every guest is offered a refill, whether it's a limited time offer like Never Ending Pasta Bowl, or our Never Ending First Course, which is offered every day. This iconic promotion also satisfies all three of our marketing activity filters. It elevates brand equity, it's simple to execute, and it's not at a deep discount. Also, I'm excited to share that during the second quarter, and for the first time in their history, Olive Garden surpassed $5 billion in sales on a trailing 52-week basis. The holidays are the busiest time of the year for all of our restaurant teams, and they embrace the opportunity to perform at their best. On Thanksgiving Day, our teams at Ruth's Chris, The Capital Grille, Eddie V's and Seasons 52 did just that, with each setting a new daily sales record. And while we experienced some softness at our fine dining brands during the quarter, we are encouraged by the strong holiday bookings we are seeing. Now, let me provide a brief update on Ruth's Chris. Even in the midst of the integration, I'm really proud of how the entire team has remained focused on the guest experience. During the quarter, Ruth's Chris achieved the top box -- top overall rating score among all full-service dining brands within Technomic's industry tracking tool. From an integration perspective, things are progressing well, and we are on track to complete the major systems changes by the end of the fiscal year. During the quarter, we closed their former corporate office and the Ruth's Chris support team moved into our restaurant support center. We are excited to have them here. In October, we successfully transitioned 21 restaurants to one of our distribution centers, and we plan to transition the remaining company operated restaurants to our distribution system between January and March. This phased approach allows us to gather learnings and improve the transition for the other restaurants, while capturing supply chain synergies. We are deliberate with the timing of any changes to ensure that we minimize the operational impact as much as possible. We are on track to deploy our people management systems by the end of the calendar year and beginning -- begin rolling out our proprietary point of sale system after Valentine's Day with the goal of completing all systems integration by the end of the fiscal year. As part of the investments we announced on our last call, we have made some strategic decisions at company owned restaurants that will impact total sales in the third quarter. First, we stopped third-party delivery. Second, we eliminated lunch wherever possible, and we will be closing most restaurants on Christmas Day. I can't say enough about the tremendous partnership between the Ruth's Chris team and our integration team. Integration is never easy, but it has been a collaborative process, and I'm happy with the progress we are making. We have reached the halfway point in our fiscal year, and I'm pleased with our performance thus far. All of our brands remain focused on managing the business for the long term and the power of Darden positions us well for the future. We also continue to work in pursuit of our shared purpose, to nourish and delight everyone we serve. One of the ways we do this for our team members and their families is through our Next Course Scholarship program. Applications opened last month for the program, which awards post-secondary education scholarships worth $3,000 each to children or dependents of Darden team members. Last year, we awarded nearly 100 scholarships to children of team members at both our restaurants and our support center. The Next Course Scholarship creates a lasting impact on the lives of our team members' families, and I'm excited that we are offering the program for a second year. Finally, as I said earlier, the holidays are the busiest time of the year for our restaurant teams. I am so proud of the focus and commitment that all our teams continue to have every day. On behalf of our senior leadership team and Board of Directors, I want to thank our more than 190,000 team members for everything you do to delight our guests and help create special holiday memories. I wish you and your families a wonderful holiday season. Now, I will turn it over to Raj. Hey, John. Thanks for the question. Nothing that we have seen is altering our plans for the balance of the year. We're really pleased with the performance of our brands. We're right along where we expected to be. And so, we don't anticipate doing anything different. Hey, Brian. Yes, it's still off the table for us. As we mentioned, we eliminated it at Ruth's Chris. And it's not all about the price and the profit, and it is profitable sales growth we're looking for, but it is also the execution of the restaurant, what it does to our teams, and how we can execute our existing to-go business. And we've made investments over the last few years to make that experience even better for our consumer, and we continue to do that. We have had third-party delivery in a few restaurants for quite a while, and the performance in those restaurants isn't significantly different than the ones that don't have it. So, we still feel really confident about our decision to stay out of the third-party delivery. Even if we had to price more to cover that, our consumer would see that as our price, not necessarily the price for delivery. So, as of now, we're still steadfast in our resolve to stay out of third-party delivery. Yes, Eric. And I just want to reiterate, we're really pleased with the performance of our other segment and all of our segments. Profitable sales growth is what we shoot for, and they all had profitable sales growth. Some might have been negative comp, but we still grew. But on the consumer overall, the consumer still continues to appear both resilient, but a little bit more selective as we've talked about in our check and we've seen that for a couple of quarters. Our data shows we're gradually moving back to our pre-COVID demographic mix, which -- with a bigger change in Q2 and moving back to pre-COVID demographics gets us to feel like we're getting closer to what normal is. I will say, we had, across all of our segments, household incomes above $200,000 are higher mix than last year, but still below pre-COVID levels. And incomes below $75,000 are under last year, but still above pre-COVID levels. And the biggest drop was those under $50,000. And this shift was most pronounced, interestingly, in our Fine Dining segment. And last thing, for those under 65 years old -- over, I'm sorry, over 65 years old, their frequency has grown from prior quarters and their dining is shifting a little bit more to lunch. So, that gives you a little bit of a check mix there, too. So -- but, again, what does that mean for us? What does that mean for the brands that we have? We believe that operators can deliver on their brand promise, which we've said before, and value will continue to appeal to consumers. I'm confident we're well positioned and prepared for what we have to deal with, thanks to the breadth of our portfolio and our astounding team members and what they do every day to create exceptional experiences for our guests. Yes, Andrew. It wasn't a huge impact for early access, but it was something that delighted our eClub users, right. So, they got something that no one else can get. And so, we'll continue to find ways to talk to them, to give them benefits of being part of the eClub without necessarily having to discount. And so, that's what we continue to look at. And that was the -- one of the first tries at it. We were encouraged by the results there, but we'll continue to look for other ways to use that eClub. Jeff, we're seeing what you see, an increase in television advertising, sometimes at a discount. But we're, as I said, focused on profitable sales growth. Even with the increase in competitive activity we saw in Q2, we exceeded the industry by 410 basis points and that was -- which was the same as second quarter. We exceeded by 410 in the second quarter, I'm sorry last quarter as well. This is on top of the 370 basis point gap we had last year. So, we feel like what we're doing is working, even with competitive and a little bit of an increase in competitive intensity. By the way, we also improved our segment profit margin by 230 basis points from last year. And so, we're going to stick to our strategy, providing everyday value to our guests, and continue to use our filters, which we've talked about many times, to evaluate any marketing activity. Hey, David. Yes. We've had a history of discipline and improvement in productivity enhancements. This year is no different. We're getting more of it, because we've had lower turnover than we've had over the last few years. We're still investing in training to get those team members up to speed quicker. We also are spending training dollars on getting our existing team members even more productive. So, our productivity enhancements were the difference between our wage inflation and our labor inflation. I will also say our teams continue to get better with forecasting our business. We've added some AI tools to their tool belt to be able to forecast their restaurant business by -- in 15 minutes increments, even better than they did before, and we're seeing added benefit, as I said, from lower turnover. Yes. David, our total labor outlook isn't that -- necessarily that different than where it's been in the first half of the year. I think, we're still having wage inflations at around the mid-single digits, which is pretty much back to pre-COVID levels. We do anticipate that as turnover continues to tick down, which we expect it should, to get us closer to pre-COVID levels. That will continue to have some productivity enhancements. In regards to the FAST Act in California, we're monitoring that. Everything that we have contemplated is contemplated in our guidance. I will say we have an amazing employment proposition and across all of our states and all of our brands, but in California, an even better employment proposition. Our turnover is lower in California than it is in most places and our wages are higher. So, we feel pretty confident that we're okay in California. But if something changes, we'll react to it. Yes, Sarah. The check management in Fine Dining is coming more from the lower income cohorts than it is from the higher income cohorts. I think, they were splurging, as we've talked about before, a little bit of euphoria in the last few years, and we're getting back to a more normal level. And in regards to pricing, your point on the follow up, recall, Raj said we don't really have a whole lot of pricing in the back half. Most of what we have is wrap. So, when you think about how much pricing we have versus inflation, most of our pricing is already embedded. And so, that's really where the delta is. So, the consumer isn't going to see a whole lot more price than they are seeing today. They might see a little bit in a couple of brands. So, we still feel really good about where we are, and we don't think it's going to really make a big change in our traffic patterns. Yes, Patrick. I will say, over the next 12 months, pretty kind of -- a little bit short term versus the strategic things that we've been doing over the last few years. But we believe that we continue to invest in technology to make it easier for our teams to execute. As I said, we've got better AI tools for scheduling and if we schedule better, we execute better. That drives performance. Our supply chain scale advantage is pretty strong, and so we're able to get better pricing for our food, which we can pass on to our consumers through lower overall check growth versus the industry. So, there's no one nugget. What I would say is, it's our back-to-basics operating philosophy that's going to continue to get us to grow. And that's excellent food, excellent service and an inviting atmosphere, executing better than the restaurant next door. That's not necessarily strategic, that's not a silver bullet, that's hard to do, and we do it really well. And that's what's really -- as Raj mentioned earlier, execution is what's driving a lot of our performance, and we'll continue to execute by using our scale to help our brands get better. Yes. Lauren, this is Rick. We see the check management a little bit more of a function of year-over-year euphoria difference. Not necessarily that the consumer is feeling a lot more pinched. Now, we -- as we said, we're getting closer. The higher income households mix is going up, the below $50,000 is going down, and that's both on the traffic side and a little bit on the check side. So, we're not hugely concerned or we're not really that concerned about the check management now, because it was really more driven by last year versus kind of a long-term trend. Yes. Andy, I think it was four. We had a couple of relocations. We had a couple of restaurants that we reopened after being temporary closed due to fires. So, that's really the bulk of those four. Yes. Andy, some of that reinvestments is already starting and some of it happens as the supply chain converts. One of the investments we made was an improvement in [indiscernible]. I don't think that's in every restaurant yet. Another one of the investments that we talked about we will be doing in December, and that is for their team closing on Christmas Day. So, there's still some things that are coming in, but we're consistent, we're on track with our timeline and we still expect accretion to be consistent with what we shared previously. Even with those investments, we're making for our team members and our guests. Sure. Hey, Greg. Yes. Versus pre-COVID, we're a bit more digital, partly because LongHorn really came off of television when we were on -- before COVID LongHorn was on TV. So, we are a bit more digital in overall mix. Olive Garden's mix isn't substantially different than before. They did come off a little bit of television, but they also came off a little bit on the digital side. We have pretty good analytics to tell us the returns on each of those things. And the good news is, during COVID we tested some more digital, and we were able to because we didn't have much media on at one time. When we started turning it on, we were actually able to see what those returns are. And that was one of the benefits of the COVID. We were able to test a little bit more, and we're testing other things on the digital front now to see if there's some things that we'll add in the future. A couple of things. As we've mentioned before, dining out is really more than just about the sustenance. It's about getting together with your family and friends to enjoy a meal. And, as Raj mentioned earlier, we still have a very big gap in the pricing that we have taken over the last four years versus what's happening in retail. I mean, I would say, if retail starts to do discounts or other deals, it's probably because they're not moving product. And so, that helps us on the -- on our cost side. So, we don't really look very much at the difference between food at home and food away from home, partly because, as I said, people think about, I want to go out to eat, and then they determine where they want to go out to eat. And so, we haven't really seen correlations in the difference in food at home, food away from home over the long, long term. Let me start by saying we're really pleased with the integration and the transition that we've had. We're six months from the close of the transaction. We still have a few changes we have to make at the restaurants, and they have to absorb them over this next six months. But that doesn't preclude us from other things. And we'll continue to talk to our Board and determine what the right use of our capital is. As you mentioned, we do have a strong balance sheet, but we're going to continue to work on this until something else comes along. Yes, John. Yes, this is an election year. It's probably going to be a pretty contentious election, with a lot of television advertising. The good news is, we're not as reliant on TV as we were in the past. And I think casual dining was much more reliant on television in the past, and chain restaurants were much more reliant on television, but now there's other media out there, more digital, more online video. And so, we aren't as concerned about an election year as maybe in the past. That said, it depends on how contentious this gets and how much media is out there. We feel confident that if we continue to focus on our strategies and execute, when people go out, they're going to come out to our restaurants. Hey, Danilo, this is Rick. You think about our margin, we've been fairly consistent over the years that we are searching for profitable sales growth and we have -- we had just updated our long term framework, we put that back out, where we'd be at 10 to 30 basis points a year in margin expansion, and any one year it could be above that or below that and we are going to get that through executing our strategy, leveraging our scale to be able to take cost out of the system and still over in a long term price below inflation to provide a better dining experience using our back to basics operating philosophy and our great operators out in the field that execute better than the restaurant next door. If we do those things and we have done those things, we will continue to drive profitable sales growth. There may be years that our margins are little bit less than that because we're gaining even more market share, and we're willing to do that. There may be years on the opposite side where we still gain share, but we have margin expansion opportunities. As Raj mentioned, we don't look at it quarter-to-quarter. We think about it over the long run. Yes, Danilo. Over the last few years, we've focused a lot of energy and technology on improving the guest experience, primarily in the off premise segment, making it easier to order, pick up and pay. We're working on our tech plans for the next few years, but I would think that AI would be a little bit more part of that, especially on the back of the house things, maybe not necessarily as consumer facing. Our goal with technology is to eliminate friction, and we've eliminated a lot of friction for the guest on the to go experience on being able to put their name on waitlist. Now we want to eliminate friction in our team, eliminate our management friction to make it easier for them. So they don't have to spend as much time doing what we think are non-value added tasks, ordering, receiving, scheduling, which is value added, but if we can make it easier for them to schedule, they can spend less time doing that and spend a lot more time with their team and with their guests. And so, the technology investments we're making -- we may be making in the future, you might not see a whole lot of impact on that from the consumer. You will see it from the consumer because our teams are going to be better trained and so that's what we are focusing on."

This morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter, and Raj will provide details on our financial results. Now, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\nRick Cardenas: Good morning, everyone. Thanks, Kevin. We had a strong quarter as we continued to outperform the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic. For the quarter, total sales were $2.7 billion, an increase of 11.6% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.78. We also opened 10 new restaurants in nine different states during the quarter. Our ability to drive profitable sales growth is a testament to the strength of our business model and adherence to our strategy. We continue to strengthen and leverage our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and a results-oriented culture, while our restaurant teams remain intensely focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere. This focus on being growing with the basics continues to drive strong guest satisfaction. In fact, our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain at or near all-time highs across all our brands. Additionally, several of our brands continue to rank number one among major casual dining brands in key measurement categories within Technomic\u2019s industry tracking tool, including LongHorn Steakhouse for food quality and taste, and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for value. Our team members bring our brands to life each day, and we know engaged team members are vital to creating great guest experiences. That's why our brands are focused on leveraging their unique cultures to strengthen team member engagement. For example, LongHorn Steakhouse created the Grill Masters Legends program that honors Grill Masters, who have grilled more than 1 million stakes throughout their career, which typically takes more than 20 years for a team member to accomplish. Five Grill Masters Legends were honored during the quarter, bringing the total to 25 team members, who have received this recognition. Also during the quarter, Yard House completed its first Best On Tap competition. Known for having more than 130 beers on-tap, Yard House tested its bar tenders from every restaurant, giving them the opportunity to showcase their beverage knowledge, parting expertise and service skills. Congratulations to this year's winner, Alyssa Hurley from the Yard House in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, who was named Best On Tap. Programs like these give us an opportunity to celebrate team members who play a critical role in the guest experience and who serve as torchbearers for their brand culture. One of the most significant ways our brands drive culture is through their annual leadership conferences, which provide the opportunity to get in front of every general manager and managing partner across all our restaurants to discuss the plans for the year and generate excitement among our operators. I was pleased to see the high levels of engagement and strong alignment on what our restaurant teams must do to continue creating exceptional guest experiences across each of our iconic brands. To further strengthen our brands, we are focused on highlighting what makes each one unique. That's why when it comes to marketing, any activity our brands undertake is evaluated through three filters. First, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations, which allows our teams to consistently deliver memorable guest experiences. And finally, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests, but doing so in a way that drives profitable sales growth. A great example of this activity was the Capital Grille's, Generous Poor event that took place during the quarter. This specially curated wine experience allows guests to sample award-winning wines that pair with items on the Capital Grille menu. And in the second quarter, Olive Garden is bringing back Never Ending Pasta Bowl, which brings to life its competitive advantage of Never Ending Abundant Craveable Italian food. Olive Garden's eClub members received a special invitation to begin enjoying NEPV this week. This guest favorite returns for everybody on Monday and will be offered at the same price point as last year. Turning to Ruth's Chris. Since the day, we announced the completion of the acquisition, we have been guided by three key objectives. First, we want to preserve the team member experience and the brand's unique culture. Ruth's Chris has many long-tenured team members and we are committed to ensuring this is a people focused process. The team is engaged and we have strong buying across the executive and operations leadership levels, all of which helps ensure a smooth transition. Next, we want to maintain and even strengthen the guest experience. Ruth's Chris is an incredibly strong brand and it ranks as one of the top brands across multiple metrics within Technomic\u2019s industry tracking tool. We now expect to realize more synergies than we originally anticipated and we plan to reinvest some of them in the guest and team member experience. Raj will provide more details during his remarks. And last, we want to successfully migrate Ruth's Chris under the Darden platform. The team leading the integration is wrapping up the planning stage and we're about to embark on the hardest part, the actual conversion to new systems and processes. We know that it's not easy, which is why we plan to complete it in phases over the next nine months to limit disruptions as much as possible. Looking across our entire portfolio, I am pleased with the quarter. Our strategy is working, we continue to grow share, strengthen margins and make meaningful investments in our business while returning capital to shareholders. And while I'm proud of our continued success, there is a larger purpose to what we do, and that is to nourish and delight everyone we serve. Not just within the four walls of our restaurants, but in the communities that our guests and team members call home. September is hunger action month and we are uniquely positioned to help fight hunger. This marks the 20th anniversary of our Harvest program. Since 2003, our restaurants have collected excess nutritious food that was not served to guests and prepared it for weekly donation to local non-profit partners. Over the life of the program, we have donated the equivalent of more than 113 million meals. And for the past 13 years, we have partnered with Feeding America to help fight hunger. Over that time, the Darden Foundation has donated more than $16 million to support their network of more than 200 food banks. Last week, together with our partners, Penske Truck Leasing and Lineage Logistics, we added 10 more refrigerated trucks for mobile food pantry programs at 10 local food banks. To date, we have added a total of 35 trucks across Feeding America food banks in 18 states. Our ability to make a difference in the fight against hunger would not be possible without the efforts of our 190,000 team members and their passion to nourish and delight everyone we serve. I'm grateful for everything you do to help make our company successful. Now I will turn it over to Raj.\nRaj Vennam: Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.7 billion, 11.6% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 77 company-owned Ruth's Chris Steakhouse restaurants, same restaurant sales growth of 5% and 46 legacy Darden net new restaurants. Our same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 410 basis points and same-restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 430 basis points. First quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.78, an increase of 14.1% from last year's reported net earnings per share. We generated $388 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $300 million of capital to our shareholders with $159 million in dividends and $143 million of share repurchases. As we look at pricing and inflation during the quarter, we had total pricing of approximately 6%, which was 300 basis points above total inflation of roughly 3%. Now looking at our margin analysis compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses were 130 basis points lower, driven by pricing leverage. While beef inflation continues to track in line with our expectations, most other categories are seeing slight favorability. As a result, total commodities inflation of approximately 1% was better than our expectations. Restaurant labor was 40 basis points better than last year, driven by productivity improvements. We expected these productivity improvements to start materializing in the second quarter, but we began realizing them sooner. Pricing and labor inflation were roughly equal at 6%. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points favorable as leverage from higher sales more than offset elevated repairs and maintenance expense. Marketing expenses were 20 basis points higher than last year consistent with our plan and including impacts from Ruth's Chris. All of this resulted in restaurant level EBITDA of 19%, 170 basis points higher than last year. G&A expenses were 110 basis points above last year, driven by three primary factors: first, higher incentive compensation due to significant growth in sales and EPS for the quarter and wrapping a very low incentive accrual in the first quarter of last year. Second, approximately $9 million of stock-based compensation expenses related to the immediate expensing of equity awards for retirement-eligible employees. And third, the addition of Ruth's Chris. Impairments were 30 basis points unfavorable to last year. We're wrapping on a $5 million gain from last year and we incurred $3 million of impairments related to a handful of closings anticipated for this year. Interest expense increased 30 basis points versus last year due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth's Chris acquisition. And for the quarter, adjusted earnings after tax was 7.9% of sales flat to last year. Now turning to our segments. Sales increased at Olive Garden and LongHorn driven by same-restaurant sales and traffic growth. This sales growth along with labor productivity and higher overall pricing related to inflation drove segment profit margin increases of 230 basis points at both Olive Garden and LongHorn. Fine Dining segment total sales increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants, but same-restaurant sales were negative at both Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s consistent with what we indicated on our earnings call last quarter. This resulted in lower segment profit margin for fine dining than last year. As we anticipated, the year-over-year same-restaurant sales decline in our Fine Dining segment was the result of ramping on a resurgence of demand in the first quarter last year that drove traffic retention to 107% of pre-COVID levels. Fine dining traffic retention in the first quarter of this year was 100% of pre-COVID levels more in line with the retention levels for the prior three quarters. The other business segment increased sales driven by positive same-restaurant sales and the addition of Ruth's Chris franchised and managed locations royalty revenue resulting in 140 basis points of segment profit margin growth. As a reminder, all of our franchise operating results are included in the other business segments. Now, I'd like to provide an update on Ruth's synergies. As Rick mentioned, we've identified more synergies than we had initially expected and are choosing to reinvest some of them in the guest and team member experience at Ruth's Chris. Previously, we anticipated $20 million in annualized run rate synergies. We now expect approximately $35 million of gross run rate synergies and other cost savings and we anticipate investing approximately $10 million into the business, resulting in annualized net run rate synergies of approximately $25 million. And for fiscal 2024, we now expect approximately $12 million of net synergies. Finally, as shared in the press release distributed this morning, we are reiterating our full year financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Our outlook still anticipates adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.55 to $8.85, including Ruth's Chris operating results, but excludes approximately $55 million of pre-tax transaction and integration-related costs. And with that, we'll take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Your Olive Garden and LongHorn showed impressive performance in 1Q, while fine dining saw headwinds as you previously warned. And I guess I'm curious, what led the decision to keep full year same-store sales guidance despite 1Q strong result. And are you perhaps seeing something in September that gives you pause on the outlook for the balance of the year? I know restaurant investors have been keen that industry data seems to be taking a breather? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Andrew. Thanks for the question. So let's start with the guidance, right? So as you think about our first quarter performance that was actually from a top line perspective, it was pretty consistent with our plan. We were within 10 basis points of our same restaurant plan we had. So the year from a top line is playing out the way we expected. So as far as -- and so that's really the trust behind how -- why we're not changing the guidance for the year. And now look, we're one quarter in, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. There's three quarters to go, and we had a range to begin with. And while we outperformed our expectations on the bottom line, we feel like it gives us a little bit of a head start, but it still puts \u2013 the point estimate is still within the range we provided at the beginning of the year.\nAndrew Charles: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks and congrats on strong results. I just want to follow-up with Andrew's question a little bit. There is a lot of anxiety, I think, out there regarding how the evolving macro could impact industry sales trends moving forward, specifically for casual dining as the benefits of pricing normalize. Just based on all your insights, do you believe that the current health of the consumer remains strongly intact? And can you help us understand what weapons you do have to keep traffic within your full year guidance range of flat to down 1.5% if the macro does deteriorate relative to your original expectations?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Brian. This is Rick. Overall, we think the consumers continues to be resilient, but there seems to be a little bit more selective. We are seeing a little softness versus last year with household incomes above $125,000 and that primarily affects our fine dining brands, but it does affect all of our brands. Now this could be because the increase in luxury travel, particularly international travel, which you've heard a lot of people talk about. But as I've said before, many times, there is attention to being what people want to pay and what they can afford, and they're going to continue to seek value, not always about low price. They're making trade-offs and food away from home is one of the most difficult things they can give up. So again, what does that mean for our brands? We believe that operators deliver on their brand promise and value will continue to be with consumers. And so we're going to keep doing that. We're going to deliver our promise. We're going to execute our brands and we're going to keep doing that and deliver value to our guests. And I'm confident we're well positioned for whatever we have to deal with. Thanks to the breadth of our portfolio and the outstanding team members in our restaurants who are committed to exceptional guest experiences. Our marketing programs, we told you what we're going to do with marketing in the prepared remarks. It's again at whatever we do is going to elevate brand equity. It's not going to be a deep discount and it's going to be simple to operate. And if it means that our traffic is at the lower end of our guide and then it's at the lower end of our guide. We're not going to do things that are going to impact us in the long-term just for short-term.\nBrian Bittner: Thanks for that Rick. And Raj, just my follow-up is, on the commodity costs. They were up 1% in the first quarter, which is obviously below your full year guidance of up 2.5%. And you did suggest that some non-beef items have been a bit more favorable. What's driving the reiteration of the 2.5% commodity guide? Is it just conservatism after one quarter? Is there anything offsetting the recent favorability as we move throughout the rest of the year?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Brian. So if you think about our inflation expectation for the first quarter, we were about 1 point better than we thought, mostly driven by, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, other categories. The beef is still a lot of uncertainty around beef and you saw from our coverage that we don't have a lot of coverage beyond, especially, as we get into the holidays and past. So there is some uncertainty around it. Now that favorability in the first quarter helps us a little bit. So what that might mean is that we might be a little bit lower in that guidance range we provided of approximately 2.5%. So maybe it's a little bit south of that. But there's three more quarters to go, and beef is really -- I mean, there's a lot of risk with beef, so...\nBrian Bittner: Okay. Hey, thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nEric Gonzalez: Thanks and good morning. My question is about the guidance as it relates to Olive Garden. And specifically, I'm curious how you're thinking about the second quarter, which is typically a seasonal low volume period for the industry. Historically, there's been a bit of a step down in revenue in Olive Garden from 1Q to 2Q, but last year was a little bit different with the return of the possible. So perhaps you can help us think about how to model that second quarter relative to your guidance and your own expectations, whether you see that fiscal second quarter revenue increasing or decreasing sequentially? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Look, I think it's -- I don't -- we don't expect a huge quarter-to-quarter sequential change. Obviously, we are relaunching now running possible that does help and that's part of the reason why we do it in the second quarter is with the back-to-school and there's a little bit of a lull and a slowdown in the casual dining and that's really the time frame. And basically, that's within our range. I mean, I think as we look at last year to this year, there's going to be some nuances with respect to pricing being a little bit lower this -- as we get into the second quarter than first quarter. But I don't want to contemplate exactly what it's going to look quarter-to-quarter.\nEric Gonzalez: Fair enough. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Harbour: Yeah. Thank you. Maybe just on the risk synergies, what were some of the additional things that you found? And then when you talk about reinvesting, would that primarily kind of be in staffing or are you also referring to kind of food and menu? Where would we kind of see that impact?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. So route synergies, generally, where we're getting them is between both the entire supply chain as well as in the G&A, right? So we initially started with an estimate as we go through the year, we're finding that as we are now in the process, we've been able to identify more, and it's in both places. So from an investment perspective, we have a long history of investing in the guest and team member experience across our brands. And so we're investing some of these additional synergies and cost savings in a similar manner, with investments that the routes guests and team members will notice and appreciate.\nBrian Harbour: Okay. Thank you. Raj, also just with your prior comments about kind of G&A for the year and kind of the quarterly progression. Is that still kind of valid? It sounds like maybe that piece -- some piece of stock-based comp was one-time in the first quarter, but could you just comment on kind of the G&A outlook?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. Sure. Yeah. As we've mentioned a couple of things, right. G&A was higher than we expected for the first quarter. Part of that was driven by our outperformance on the bottom line. I mentioned earlier that while sales were more in line, we did outperform on the bottom line that helped that cost a little bit more incentive comp. And then stock-based comp, that is truly a onetime. I mean that's more of a timing, but it's pulling forward some from future years, right? But as we look at the full year, G&A is likely to be a little bit higher than what we talked about last quarter. So I think last quarter, we talked about closer to $430 million. I would say, at this point, it\u2019s probably closer to $440 million on the year.\nBrian Harbour: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering, Rick, if you could talk about how you're thinking about unit growth for the next several years. And I know at one point, you were trying to push unit growth towards the high end of your annual targets. And I'm wondering, if that's still your desire and perhaps, Raj, if you could give us an update on what you're seeing on returns and build costs, that would be helpful. Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Hey, David. Thanks. In regards to development and unit growth, we do want to get to the top end of our long-term framework of 3% unit -- sales growth from new restaurants. As we've said in the past, there's still some permitting delays. We're seeing a little less on the utility connections and those kind of things, but we're still -- it's still taking a little longer to get permits. We also are being a little selective, especially where inflation and costs have made the economics of the deal is a little less attractive. And we generally like to have good margin of error with our projects. And so we've turned down a few projects that just because costs are a little higher than we wanted them to be. And we've done that in the past, and we've been able to get back to those same projects at the costs that are more reasonable for us. So we're willing to wait a little bit to get the cost back more in line. That said, we believe inflation has peaked and we are starting to receive more bids that are in line with our project budgets and some even actually below our project budgets. So that gives us some good feelings for the future. We still believe we have the opportunity to grow close to the high end of our framework and we are actively building that pipeline.\nRaj Vennam: And David, on the returns, we are -- our returns are still pretty strong. We are -- any project we approve has to be net present value accretive to us. And as Rick mentioned, we generally like to have a little bit of headroom within our margin of error as we approve projects. Maybe that buffer is not as high as it used to be. But when we look at actual performance on average, we exceed our internal hurdles by quite a bit.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. And David, I'm going to add one more thing. If you think about us saying that we'd like to see a little bit of a buffer in our net present value over our cost of capital, that's because we have all the capital we need and so we're going to be selective in projects. And the thing that's going to keep us from growing way faster than our long-term framework unit growth is having people ready to run those restaurants and that's what we focus on as well. We're focusing on developing people and we think we've got a great pipeline of people as well.\nDavid Tarantino: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Just a follow-up, this was asked before, but I'm not sure I quite got the answer. Given where food costs and route synergies are coming in, we were surprised that you're not also increasing the low end of your EPS guidance for the year -- fiscal year. What are the potential offsets to what we're seeing in terms of what looks like upside to your plan on the EPS and the EBITDA line?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, David. I think it's a fair question. But we're just one quarter in, right? So there's nine months to go. There's been mixed data on the consumer. We're trying to understand what's going to happen. And so we felt like it was too early to really come off of the range we provided. As I said earlier, our point estimate from the beginning of the year to now has moved up a little bit. I mean that's because of our performance in the first quarter, but that doesn't mean we're outside the range. So we didn't feel like we're at a place where we needed to change the guidance range. And there's -- so to your question around uncertainty, there are a few things. Primary biggest risk is obviously on the consumer, what happens with the consumer. Second is on the commodities. We're trying to understand what's going to happen, especially with beef, 22% of our basket is beef. So there's some risk there. Now the pricing in beef has remained pretty high because of the supply being down in the mid-single digits. We're starting to see some additional imports that might help on the beef front, but it's too early. So I guess all things considered at this point, we felt like it was prudent to stay with the guidance we provided.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you for that. I know you're not going to give the game plan for the company in terms of marketing in ways that you might pivot. But I'm wondering, just generally speaking, if we're seeing the industry trend worse than the flattish type trend that would be consistent with your guidance given your current [indiscernible]. If your traffic is down more than just modestly or you see it going that way. How -- can -- how would you adjust? I mean, what are the ways and Rick said, you're not going to go deep discount route, but what ways do you think you would adjust with your major brands? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Dave. You're right. We're not going to give you too much information on what we would do. But just understand that we believe that the best long-term health of our business is to keep our strategy of overall pricing below inflation, running better restaurants and not getting into a huge deep discounting to buy guests. We think that brings in the guests that just come in that are a little bit less core to our business and we're going to continue to operate our restaurants to drive one more visit from our core guests. And if that means that others start doing some heavy discounting, we\u2019re going to stick to our strategy. And even if it means that it\u2019s a short term, it impacts us a little bit in the short term because we think we\u2019ll be better off in the long term if we stay with where we\u2019re going.\nDavid Palmer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. One, just on the competition. Rick, I know you were pretty clear that you're not keen to start being more aggressive with discounting, doesn't benefit you long term. But are you seeing any changes in the broader competitive behavior? I think there are some that are concerned of an uptick in promos and discounting to drive traffic, especially with the commodity inflation easing. So contrary to your strategy, just wondering what you're seeing across the broader landscape. And then I had one follow-up.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Jeff. One thing, yeah, commodities might be easing, but labor is still pretty high. If not -- it's getting a little bit better. But even if commodities are deflationary, there's still net inflation, at least in our business, and I'm guessing in other business too. That said, we have seen a slight increase in promotional activity, but particularly with one barn grill competitor and in the family dining segment. We're really not seeing a whole lot of competitive increase in competitive activity in kind of the Olive Garden range and above other than, as I said, that one bar and grill competitor that seems to be ramping up a little bit. Well, I said, Olive Garden is usually one of the top brands in share of voice. So no matter what this competitive activity is and television activity. Olive Garden is usually one of the top few brands in share of voice, but our message is about more and more and more. Come in to Olive Garden for more, more food, more value, more refills. And that's what we're talking about. And as I said, we'll stick to our strategy. And I'd tell you, that's reinforced Never Ending Pasta Bowl. So Never Ending Pasta Bowl is about never ending craveable by an Italian food at a great value, and it's right on our plan. We're doing exactly what we planned for at the beginning of this fiscal year with Never Ending Pasta Bowl, nothing new.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got you. And then just a follow-up. I know earlier you mentioned something about seasonality. I know you're referring specifically to fine dining relative to last year. But as you think about broader casual dining historically, I get the feeling right sales slow in September post maybe a stronger summer and battling now back-to-school. But I feel like the past couple of years, there was a lot of pent-up demand post-COVID and therefore, maybe there was no seasonality. People are willing to go out even during this time frame, and therefore, less seasonality. I'm just wondering, should we now expect to return to seasonality that maybe could explain if you were to see a slowdown in coming weeks. I'm just wondering how you kind of think about that if seasonality were to return, how you decipher whether it's traditional seasonality or slow in consumer? Any thoughts there around that would be great. Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Jeff. We actually do think seasonality is getting back to historic trends. And the data we talked about for fine dining with getting back to kind of 100% of pre-COVID levels. We're seeing the same thing. I'm not saying at the 100%, but the same kind of trends back towards similar trends of pre-COVID levels now, where last year, we do think there was a little bit of pent-up demand. And so we're going to watch it. We're going to see what happens for the rest of this month and the rest of next month. But it appears like, now we\u2019re getting much closer to what the seasonal patterns were.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Joshua Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Long: Great. Thank you for taking my question. When we think about the trends you reported here in the first quarter, I understand that the strength was largely in line with what you were expecting. Curious, if you could dive into any sort of comments around pacing, geographic performance, daypart, day of week, anything there or perhaps sales channel kind of in the to-go business for Olive Garden?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Josh. I think from a geography perspective, we're seeing more strength in New England, Northeast, we're seeing some softness or at least below company average in California, Texas and Florida when we look at the entire portfolio. Now brand by brand, there's a little bit of variability. But when you look at across our portfolio, that's the areas where we're seeing in terms of regional differences. Most others are kind of in between, and so kind of closer to the company average, if you will. But definitely seeing strength in the Northeast and especially New England area overall. From a daypart perspective, we are seeing some lunch getting better at casual brands. And so that's really it. Outside of that, I don't know that there's any additional color we can provide on the sales detail.\nJoshua Long: That's helpful. And then one point of clarification, Raj, there. When we think about maybe California, Texas, Florida being a little bit softer on a relative basis, do we think about that just from a kind of base of comparison? It feels like they were probably stronger over the last couple of years. So maybe it's just a kind of point of comparison. And then maybe, Rick, when you think about just that opportunity to drive the marketing and messaging, I would totally agree about the opportunity for the balance of operational execution and value to be a big key component in the second half of the year. It doesn't sound like you need to lean in or change the messaging. Is that correct? I mean you feel good with how you're communicating that it's about going out and executing it.\nRaj Vennam: Okay. So let me -- yeah, you're right on the year over. It's really driven by a function of last year on the softness I'm talking about in those markets or the strength because last year, they were in a different place. So that's a one year -- truly a one-year thing, and then I'll let Rick comment on the marketing.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Josh. I think now that we're seeing that we think we're getting back to more seasonal patterns. We look at our traffic trends versus pre-COVID. They're fairly consistent across the last four quarters across most of our brand -- actually, in most of our segments. And so we believe what we're doing is getting us to exactly where we were before without a bunch of marketing with at maybe slightly lower traffic levels because of that marketing. And so we're going to stick to what we're doing and see if the patterns dramatically change. And if they do, we have levers to pull that aren't necessarily deep discounts. And one of them that we just pulled with Never Ending Pasta Bowl was to give our eClub members a preview of Never Ending Pasta Bowl, which again was always in our plan. It was in our plan at the beginning of this fiscal year. It's not something we're doing differently we're doing it to learn. If we give our eClub members a little bit more reason to be in the club without giving them a discount to be in the club, then maybe that\u2019s going to drive more. So we\u2019re still learning, and we\u2019re looking at digital marketing and other things that we\u2019ve done and we\u2019ve learned throughout COVID. And if we do anything, we could use those levers but not necessarily deep discounts.\nJoshua Long: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thanks, guys. Wondering if you could speak a bit more or a bit to the dining room traffic levels broadly across the portfolio or even an Olive Garden specifically. And sort of how you think about where those dine-in traffic levels are currently, where they can go relative to the to-go business? Have we normalized or is there still an opportunity to see more dine-in recovery gains on the traffic side at this point?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Dennis. Our off-premise has gone quite a bit from where we were before COVID. So from a traffic perspective, yeah, we're probably in that 80% range in terms of traffic relative to pre-COVID at our largest brand in Olive Garden. But from a sales perspective, we're probably closer to where we were before COVID. Now with that said, but part of that is, as we talked about, we made a conscious decision to pull back a lot on promotional activity, couponing and marketing dollars that we spend at Olive Garden. So we're a healthier business. And so we like where we are. From the -- but also -- it also gives us opportunity, right? There is capacity in the dining room, which provides us more opportunity, but we're going to go at it in a way that's durable. That is actually not a one-time get people in the door, but we want to build it over time. That's why we're so focused on core menu, everyday value and executing at the highest levels we can so that we can slowly build back.\nDennis Geiger: Helpful, Raj. And then just one quick one, just on the quarter itself. Anything to notable to call out either traffic or on the mix side of things at Olive Garden or LongHorn?\nRaj Vennam: Well, I would say, our traffic was actually a little bit better than we thought going into the quarter, but our mix was a little bit worse. So what we're seeing is from a check perspective at Olive Garden and LongHorn, a little bit of pullback in alcohol sales and some entree mix -- negative entree mix. But that's really what I can share at this point.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Appreciate it, Raj. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Good morning. Can you comment on the level of absolute pricing you're facing versus your local peers? And why is a prudent strategy for Darden to be increasing prices above inflation. I know that you spoke several times about how you might deviate from pricing below inflation in specific period, but why now? Is it a prudent strategy?\nRaj Vennam: So Danilo, let me start with saying where we are from a pricing standpoint. Our overall pricing in the quarter was about 6%, as we said. We expect the full year to be closer to mid-3%s maybe closer to 3% to 4%, 3.5% to 4%. That said, when you look at where we are related to pre-COVID, our pricing over that time frame is in that 17% to 18%, including this quarter that we just talked about is 18%. Where the peers are, on average are about 600 basis points to 700 basis points higher than us over that time frame, which means that we have created a gap. Now most of our pricing this quarter is a wrap from pricing actions we took last year. In fact, I think the impact from this year -- the actions this year make up less than 10% of our total pricing. So we -- the carryover from last year represents 3%. So overall, from a pricing strategy perspective, we feel like we're in a great place. We feel like we have created the gap to our competitors and that gap is not going to get any narrower. We don't expect that when we end the year that maybe quarter-to-quarter, there may be tens of basis points of delta to our peers. But when we look at it overall, we feel like we're going to be still ahead of competition. Part of that is because our inflation that we experience is better than most of our peers and we try to target our own inflation in terms of how we price. But our inflation because of our scale ends up being generally much less than especially some of the local peers you're talking about.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Extremely clear. Thank you, Raj. And one more question, if you don't mind. So can you comment on the pace of integration efforts, especially in the light of the new synergies that you have found, do you think there is a potential to accelerate the full integration? And if so, is there any timing upside to the EPS accretion in fiscal '24 and '25?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, Danilo. As we mentioned earlier, we are finished the planning process and we're about to embark on the hardest part, but it's only going to take us nine months. So think about integrating 80 owned and operated Ruth's Chris restaurants, thinking about the franchise systems, getting all of our operated restaurants on our point-of-sale system, on our payroll system and all of the other systems. We don't want to go too much faster than nine months just because that's a lot of disruption in the restaurant. So we're going to pace it at the right level. We've already -- as we've said, we've brought our synergy estimate up for this year from $5 million to $10 million, I believe, to $12 million this year about and that includes reinvesting some of the synergies that we found. So that would tell you that we got a little bit faster. But we wanted to make investments just like we do in our other brands. So if we get even faster on some of the synergies we see that the synergies are even higher than we've just analyzed then we may make more investments. And so, we'll do what is right for the long-term health of the business, but we're not going to try to integrate too fast and we're going to stay at our pace.\nDanilo Gargiulo: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your questions.\nJeffrey Farmer: Great. Thank you. Some big picture casual dining questions. So some of the NAP data, some of the other traffic source data, so that casual lining traffic growth slowed in August, has slow it into early September. You guys are obviously taking a lot of market share. But again, bigger picture from your perspective, what sort of consumer or macro factors are contributing most to that softening traffic trend for that casual dining consumer?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Jeff. I'm going to start with seasonality, as we've talked a couple of times, this is -- September is typically the low seasonal pattern. Last year, it wasn't, the same thing with August. And so I would start by saying seasonal patterns are getting back -- more back to normal when you compare all of our segments to pre-COVID levels, over the last four quarters, we've been pretty consistent. And so the other thing, as we've already mentioned, is there is -- the consumer is starting to have a little bit less confidence and they're a little bit more selective. And so we're going to continue to work on what we've worked on. But I think that pricing in the industry may have caused a little bit of this, but we've been pricing well below the industry and we feel good about where our pricing position is compared to everybody else and we're just going to execute.\nJeffrey Farmer: All right. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on pricing. So pricing 6% in 1Q. You guys are guiding to that 3.5% to 4% for the full year \u201824. But what is that -- how should we be thinking about pricing moving forward, just sort of the cadence. So it's 1% -- or 6% in 1Q. What theoretically would Darden blended pricing look like in 2Q, 3Q, et cetera?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah. I\u2019d say, we're looking at probably closer to 5% in the second quarter, 3%-ish by the time we get to third quarter and probably closer to 2% or below 2% by the time we get to fourth quarter.\nJeffrey Farmer: All right. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jon Tower with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess going a little bit authorization here, but curious to get your thoughts. California is changing or potentially changing the way that it pays its employees in the fast food side, I would argue it's going to have some implications for the broader industry in California and perhaps beyond that. So I'm curious to get your thoughts, one, on how you handle an environment where aggregate labor inflation starts taking off pretty dramatically in one state, perhaps spilling elsewhere? And then two, be curious to get your thinking around how the industry evolves either in that market or more broadly? And do you see this as an opportunity to accelerate share in that market even though costs might be moving a little bit higher? I would think that some independents in that market, in particular, might have to shut down given the cost to operate will be a little bit beyond reasonable levels?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Jon. Let me start by saying the fast act you're talking about in California. I know it impacts fast food first and that could lead to higher wages across other segments of the dining experience. Our employment proposition is great. We've got a great employment proposition. As we talk about and I think we've mentioned before, our average wages, including tips are over $22 now across the country. But when you look it in California, it's higher than that. And so I think as labor costs continue to grow, we've had that in other markets where we've seen minimum wages grow or we've seen a reduction in the tip credit, and we've been able to execute and continue to gain share there. So if this does impact restaurants, it's probably going to impact the ones that have a little less capital and a little less the ability to withstand that. Just like we've seen in other markets where wages have grown really fast. We've been able to pick up share because we're still there. So we're going to focus on what we can control, which is providing a great guest experience and trying to continue to price below inflation. And if inflation is higher, others are going to have to price more and we'll be able to gain share by taking a little less price. We're going to stick to our strategy.\nJon Tower: Got it. So the idea of taking potentially more price in that market later this year is not off the table given that inflationary pressure.\nRick Cardenas: Nothing is ever off the table, if things change dramatically on inflation. What we talked about with the pricing actions that we've already taken, most of our pricing is already built in. But that 2% that Raj said in Q4 could be higher if things change. And it\u2019s highly unlikely, it could be lower, but it could be higher if things change.\nJon Tower: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nSara Senatore: Thank you. A question on margins and then a quick one on marketing. The restaurant level margins better than we had expected. But I guess given pricing, the gap between pricing and commodities, even with labor inflation and I think the mid-high single digits maybe then in that context, the margin expansion wasn't quite as high. I guess given that pricing is going to roll-off and inflation is, I think it could shift higher. Are there any kind of dynamics that I should be thinking about with respect to that margin performance? I think you had said in the past that we should expect it to moderate, but a pretty wide gap between commodity inflation and price this quarter and offset, I think, by mix and some other factors. Is anything -- any different dynamics that we might expect to see through the quarter the quarters to come? And could you talk about whether the fine dining, whether there was an impact from Ruth's in terms of just sort of negative mix versus just with the negative comps that might have delevered.\nRaj Vennam: Yes, Sara. So let me try to make sure I answer all the aspects of that question. So let's start with the margins. So from a margin perspective, yes, you're right. If you just look at absolute pricing and commodities inflation or overall inflation and you could say, well, you didn't get the full delta between the pricing and inflation. The things we have to think about are a few things. One, there is a negative mix. First of all, let's start with the brand mix. When you have negative comps at our -- some of our high-margin brands that has a negative impact on our overall blended margin. And you saw that LongHorn and Olive Garden had 230 basis points each of segment profit margin, which is really what -- where you're seeing the most strength. The decline in fine dining, part of that is driven by incremental costs they have year-over-year. Their pricing is starting to catch up. But also, there was some negative mix, on a one-year basis, there was a lot of negative mix on alcohol. When we look at what's happening with -- at Fine Dining, there is trading down to lower-priced wines and other alcohols on a one-year basis. However, when we look at it versus where we were pre-COVID, we don't see a big fall-off. So this feels like there was -- clearly goes back to that exuberance that existed a year ago that we're wrapping on. And so part of that margin impact is from that. And then, the last piece I'd say is, some of the restaurant expenses still have high inflation, whether it's repairs and maintenance, we're running mid-single digit inflation on those lines and so that's part of that. Last piece is utilities. We had a record summer -- record heat. So that caused tremendous usage, much -- we've ever seen historically in terms of electric usage and that translated into some incremental cost to.\nSara Senatore: That's very helpful to hit all the parts. Thank you. And then just on the marketing, you said your top line was pretty much as expected, maybe traffic a little bit better. I know you took up marketing as a percentage of revenues by 20 basis points, 30 basis points. Could you just talk about kind of the returns you're seeing on that in that context of in line and maybe a bit better traffic, how you're feeling about that ratio versus going back to the lower one or edging it higher?\nRick Cardenas: Yes, Sara. Our marketing versus prior year was up 20 basis points, about half of that was just roots mix. So bringing roots into the mix. Our marketing was a little bit higher. And the other 10% was already in our plan. So the planned performance included the tenth in marketing. So we believe we're getting an ROI on that. And we've learned over during the COVID times how to -- we've been able to analyze marketing better because when you completely eliminate it and you start adding back, you can really see the impact of it versus when you have a lot of it and you add a little bit, it's harder to see. So we're able to read the marketing much better in the ROIs and marketing, and we believe there is one.\nSara Senatore: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Saleh: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to come back to the conversation around menu mix. I think you mentioned some declines in alcohol mix as some of the fine dining brands, but you also mentioned something similar at the core brands, some alcoholics and entree mix (ph) that was a little bit less than you expected. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that on what you're seeing? Is this the first time you've seen this pull back in this -- or change in consumer behavior since pre-COVID?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, Peter. I would say on the casual brands, we're only seeing it at Olive Garden and LongHorn and it's not alarming. What we're talking about is tens of basis points of negative mix. So it's not at a point where we're like, hey, we're missing check by quite a bit. But it's about -- in an environment where you have a pricing in that 6% range in the -- take an example, the last quarter, to have maybe 50 basis points of negative mix. It doesn't feel like it's a huge impact, but it was a little bit worse than we expected. But we're not reading too much into that, primarily because when we look at what's happening at Cheddar's, we're not seeing a negative mix there. So -- and the other part of it is we have introduced some menu items that are more -- at LongHorn, for an example, we have some items that are better margin, pricing difference there might be causing people to trade down, but it's not hurting our margins. So we're actually okay with that some negative entree mix we're seeing. So it's too early to draw too much into the -- to kind of read too much into this negative mix that we're seeing on the check at the casual brands. From fine dining, yeah, we truly believe it is a function of exuberance last year. We were seeing a huge positive mix last year and that's going away. I mean we've actually had that for four or five quarters until -- I think until we got through to the second quarter of last year. And so now we're starting to things normalize. And this is -- that's why when we wanted to look at it versus pre-COVID and when we look at it through that lens, we did not see any big drop off at the fine dining.\nPeter Saleh: Thanks for that. And then, Rick, I think you mentioned that labor obviously is still inflationary, but has improved. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing on the labor side? Is it just more availability of labor are starting wages lightening out or coming down? Any more detail on that front would be helpful. Thanks.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. We're seeing it much easier to hire than we have in the last few years. We've gotten much more applicants for every job than we've had before. If you think about the employment proposition that we've mentioned, it includes a minimum wage of $12 an hour, including gratuities (ph). And as we're seeing, yes, wage inflation is up, but our starting wage inflation is lower than our overall inflation. So it seems like it's getting a little bit easier to hire people, and we don't have to hire at such a high rate, just to get people in the door. We're fully staffed. Our turnover is getting coming down. And so our starting wage inflation is much lower or our entry-level wage inflation when people come to work for us is lower than our overall inflation, which is a good time.\nPeter Saleh: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nGregory Francfort: Hey, thanks. Rick, I think you made a comment earlier on the call about maybe the -- if you're seeing a little bit of softness, it's more in the over $125,000 income consumer. And I guess that's just surprising because I think a lot of the concern is more on the lower income side of things. And I'm curious what you think might be driving that?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Greg. I think a couple of things. One, if you look over the last few years, wage growth has been higher at the lower income level and at the higher income level and inflation while it impacts the lower income more, their wages had grown faster than inflation over time. And I kind of mentioned it. I think a little bit of it now is the exuberance from last year and actually this summer, there was a lot of international travel. You saw that when airlines talked about adding roots internationally, and that could have been part of the reason maybe our Florida and California markets weren't as strong because maybe people weren't traveling here, they were traveling outside the U.S. because they hadn't been able to do that for a few years. I know anecdotally, I've talked to quite a few folks that have had international travel plans in their sights for two or three years, but they were just not doing it because of COVID, and they did it this summer. So it could be because we've had a lot of that. We're not reading too much into it. That said, we're going to watch and monitor and see, and see if something dramatically changes, but we're not too concerned right now. We just wanted to make sure that you understood that the $125,000 and up is something that we're seeing a little softness in or at least we did in the first quarter.\nGregory Francfort: Got it. And maybe just one other. As you look at the mix of Ruth's franchise versus company-owned, do you think that would go higher or lower over time? Do you have a goal of that increasing or decreasing or kind of things more stable?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Greg. I want to start by saying, we're really -- our focus is integrating our current restaurants. We've got 81 company-operated restaurants into Darden. Our Ruth's Chris franchise, these are valued partners to us. If they have growth opportunities and they want to continue to grow and it makes sense, then we'll let them grow with us. But we expect to grow our own Ruth's restaurants as well. So I would anticipate that over time, the mix of Ruth's company-owned or company operated compared to franchise will go down. It doesn't necessarily mean that franchise -- number of franchises will get on, it's because we're going to open more restaurants at Ruth's. And so that's how we're going to stick to it.\nGregory Francfort: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. I know in the past, we've talked about some different traffic performance from the under 35 consumer and the over 55 consumer. And it is interesting, especially for some of your older consumers who may be on fixed incomes actually could be benefiting from the increase in interest rates, but conversely, the sub-35 consumer, based on where their incomes are, the student loan repayments might actually affect them the most. Maybe it's a little bit of a real term question, but I wonder if you're beginning to see behavior differences not just from an income cohort, but from an age cohort and how you see that influencing your business?\nRaj Vennam: Yeah, John. Actually, what we are -- we are continuing to see actually the consumers below 35 be actually continuing to grow as a mix. In fact, when we look at versus last year versus last quarter and as well as versus pre-COVID, consumers below 35 are still trending better. In fact, and then 55 plus, especially 65-plus is still below pre-COVID and actually a slight decline from last quarter to this quarter. So we -- so it feels like from a mix perspective, we're seeing more younger consumer. And we're kind of seeing something along the lines of what Rick mentioned on the income spectrum too, where our lower income makes up a bigger percentage of our guest base today than it did before COVID. But we're not seeing any cracks in that those trends because we've been tracking that for a few quarters now and it seems to be holding up pretty well. Now if is something going to change in the future, we can -- and at this point, we don't have any insight to say whether that's going to change or not.\nJohn Ivankoe: And in terms of reattracting that 55 or 65 year old, I mean because -- I mean, if I would have told you about four years ago, we would have said, gosh, that's a big change for your business, especially at Olive Garden. Is there a way to kind of reattract that consumer, I assume it wouldn't be specific to your brands that it would be broadly, but is that an opportunity to maybe re-add that subset of customers?\nRick Cardenas: Hey, John. I think about reattracting any consumer. We're trying to add one more visit from our loyal guests and we had a lot of loyal guests above 65. I do believe that they were a little bit more spooked on the COVID side and they should have been. If COVID have impacted them a little bit more. And we're going to continue to focus our efforts. And if we can do some targeted marketing to them, we've got a big e-club. We can use our eClub to talk to them and say, hey, come back to Olive Garden. But I don't think we're going to do some dramatic things because we've actually seen a pretty big increase in our younger consumer. And I think if people would have asked us five years ago to say, hey, we don't have enough younger consumers, they would have thought, wow, I can't believe how many consumers you've had on the younger side. So we actually like that consumer. We think that consumer is going to be a strong consumer for us, but we value all of our customers, including those over 65 and we'd love to see them come back more frequently.\nJohn Ivankoe: Understood. Thank you. Sorry.\nA \u2013 Rick Cardenas: Yeah. Sure. And I want to clarify something that I said to Greg, I said that our operated restaurants will be lower in mix for Ruth\u2019s and not, it\u2019s actually higher. So it should be higher in the future. Sorry about that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.\nBrian Vaccaro: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just two quick data items, if you could. Could you share what off-premise mix was for Olive Garden and LongHorn in the quarter? And I know it will be in the 10-Q, but maybe also what was traffic for each of those brands in the quarter?\nRaj Vennam: Hey, Brian. so Olive Garden was about 22%, a little over 22%. So that's about a couple of points lower than where we were a year ago. This is not one of the high quarters. And then from a LongHorn perspective, they were about 13% off-premise. From a traffic perspective, I'd say Olive Garden was low-single digit or slightly positive. It might have been 0.3%, 0.4%. LongHorn was in the 1.5% range for traffic.\nBrian Vaccaro: Okay. Thank you. And then just following up quickly on the Ruth's acquisition. If you've had a chance to dig further in the customer segmentation, could you just elaborate on the differences you see in Ruth's customer base versus other fine dining brands? And I'm curious on the reinvestments you're making there. What are some of the key areas you see an opportunity to improve the guest experience? Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Brian. On the Ruth's customer base, a lot of our customer research is based on data that we get through our POS and we haven't done the integration of POS. So I'm just using some data that we have from the past. It's a slightly different consumer than we see at Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s. And as we've mentioned before, we have very little overlap in the consumer for Ruth's Chris and the consumer for Capital Grille and Eddie V\u2019s. So that's a good thing. We're reaching a consumer for a different need state than they've had before. Ruth's is a little bit more suburban than the other brands that we've mentioned. And so we're going to continue to learn more about that consumer. In regards to the investments that we've made or that we're going to be making, as Raj said, we have a history of making investments in our team and in our food. And those are the kind of investments we're going to be making with these additional synergies more on the food side, but still some investments on the team side. I don't want to get into the exact investments that we're making now.\nBrian Vaccaro: Fair enough. Thank you.\nRick Cardenas: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jake Bartlett with Truist. Please proceed with your questions.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I'm hoping you can give us a little perspective on your expectations for the resumption of student loan payments. I imagine you've done some work on it. What do you think the impact could be on your brands and maybe even just the casual dining space in general?\nRick Cardenas: Yeah, Jake. As we've said before, the restaurant industry is impacted really more about discretionary spending. We don't expect consumer repayment of student loans is going to be a material impact to Darden over time. And recall that a lot of these have already started being made. So I think in the month of August or -- month of August, it was about $1 billion a week. And that could be because some people are just deciding to pay off their entire student loan before the interest rate starts back up. And so the expectation was it's going to be about $80 billion or so a year in student loan repayment and we're almost at that run rate now. So -- and I also know I've read and seen, and I think you've all read that a lot of these student loan payments are the folks that are above $125,000. So maybe that's part of it as well. Maybe they've started to pay off their student loan. So we want to see how this progresses over time. But as we've said, we don't think it's going to be a meaningful impact to our business on the margins, it could be an impact, but it's not going to be a meaningful impact to our business. Discretionary spending is a bigger impact.\nJake Bartlett: Okay. Great. I'm going to go with kind of an odd question, but I think it's -- I think it's something that investors are focusing more and more on and I'm not sure how valid it is or not. But I'm wondering your perspective on GLP1 drugs and the impact on restaurant demand, maybe Darden\u2019s restaurant demand. I'm not going to ask your average BMI for your customers, but any perspective there, any perspective? I know it's something that's on investors' minds, so I figured I'd ask.\nRick Cardenas: Yeah. I didn't mean to laugh. But when you talked about my BMI, I'm not going to get into that.\nJake Bartlett: I know yours as well.\nRick Cardenas: I don't know about that. Let me start by saying full-service dining occasions are driven by desire to connect with family and friends. Our -- if you think about the frequency of our full servers dining gas is a couple of times 2 times, 3 times a year for a good guess. So over the years, we have spent a lot of time designing our menus to ensure guests have a wide range of choices to suit their individual needs. And we're going to react to whatever happens, but we don't think it's going to be a meaningful impact to us because of the celebratory nature with for people, why people come out to eat. And if it suppresses appetite a little bit, they're still going to eat. So we're going to be there for them when they do.\nJake Bartlett: Great. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Parke with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Parke: Hey. Good morning. I guess can you guys just talk about the margin recovery at LongHorn kind of in face of deep inflation? And I guess, should we expect that to tail a little bit worse as we kind of move through the year?\nRaj Vennam: Hey, John. I think we -- what we talked about, if you recall, a year ago, was there was opportunity to get some margin back at LongHorn. Part of that was we had made -- LongHorn's team had made some strategic choices along the way to make investments in food quality and invest well below -- at pricing well below inflation as they were growing traffic. And LongHorn, by the way, does have significant -- actually positive traffic in the dining room relative to pre-COVID. And so we're at a place where we now can pivot a little bit back to getting some of the margin that we wanted to get and so LongHorn team has done a great job getting to some of that margin growth. And we feel like we're in a much better place from an overall business model perspective, especially given the top line momentum they have to be able to see the margins where they are. It's just -- it provides strong returns within our portfolio.\nJohn Parke: Great. Best of luck, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Strelzik: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had two quick ones for me. The first is on your commodity baskets. It looks like you have less lock than you did with the last update. Now I'm just wondering if that's typical. Is it intentional or things getting a little bit more difficult there with those conversations with suppliers. So that would be the first question. The second one, on the off-premise numbers that you gave in terms of the mix it sounds like you think that's seasonality or due to the kind of lower volume nature of the quarter. I mean -- we know that delivery also is softening up a little bit across the industry. Do you think that there's more shifting to food at home or any other dynamics that might be play there? Thanks.\nRaj Vennam: Okay. Let me first start with the coverage. So yeah, you pointed out, we have about 55% coverage for the next six months, which is actually the same as what we had a year ago, but a bit lower than what we would have had before COVID. In terms of the ability to get coverage, I would say at this point, it's still difficult to secure long-term coverage at the prices we like for beef and that's really the primary driver. If you look at our coverage, we don't have as much coverage in beef as we would have liked to at this point in time. And then the other point, as poultry, you see that we have about 65% covered, but normally, we're much more covered in that. Part of that is because we renewed -- we started a contract last year in December that actually just expires this December. So we're in the midst of trying to renegotiate that. And so that's kind of the reason why we're a little bit lower. But yeah, you\u2019re right. I mean, we would like to have a little bit more coverage. But as I mentioned, beef is still not where it is, would like it to be, especially going past the holidays, it\u2019s hard to lock out \u2013 getting into the holiday, December and pass, it\u2019s hard to lock in at prices we like. So from a dining room perspective, both LongHorn and Olive Garden had traffic growth in the quarter, right? So that means that some of the guests this off-premise question you asked, it\u2019s shifting to the dining room. So we\u2019re not concerned because, yeah, off-premise was down a couple of points that Olive Garden gotten year-over-year, but that means the dining room grew by more than 2 points. And that\u2019s -- we\u2019re happy with that. We actually prefer to have guests in the dining room.\nAndrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Kevin Kalicak for any closing comments.\nKevin Kalicak: Thank you. That concludes our call. And I'd like to remind you that we plan to release second quarter results on Friday, December 15, before the market opens with the conference call to follow. Thank you for all for participating in today's call.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Raj Vennam",
            "content": "Thank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Total sales for the first quarter were $2.7 billion, 11.6% higher than last year, driven by the addition of 77 company-owned Ruth's Chris Steakhouse restaurants, same restaurant sales growth of 5% and 46 legacy Darden net new restaurants. Our same-restaurant sales for the quarter outpaced the industry by 410 basis points and same-restaurant guest counts exceeded the industry by 430 basis points. First quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.78, an increase of 14.1% from last year's reported net earnings per share. We generated $388 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned approximately $300 million of capital to our shareholders with $159 million in dividends and $143 million of share repurchases. As we look at pricing and inflation during the quarter, we had total pricing of approximately 6%, which was 300 basis points above total inflation of roughly 3%. Now looking at our margin analysis compared to last year. Food and beverage expenses were 130 basis points lower, driven by pricing leverage. While beef inflation continues to track in line with our expectations, most other categories are seeing slight favorability. As a result, total commodities inflation of approximately 1% was better than our expectations. Restaurant labor was 40 basis points better than last year, driven by productivity improvements. We expected these productivity improvements to start materializing in the second quarter, but we began realizing them sooner. Pricing and labor inflation were roughly equal at 6%. Restaurant expenses were 10 basis points favorable as leverage from higher sales more than offset elevated repairs and maintenance expense. Marketing expenses were 20 basis points higher than last year consistent with our plan and including impacts from Ruth's Chris. All of this resulted in restaurant level EBITDA of 19%, 170 basis points higher than last year. G&A expenses were 110 basis points above last year, driven by three primary factors: first, higher incentive compensation due to significant growth in sales and EPS for the quarter and wrapping a very low incentive accrual in the first quarter of last year. Second, approximately $9 million of stock-based compensation expenses related to the immediate expensing of equity awards for retirement-eligible employees. And third, the addition of Ruth's Chris. Impairments were 30 basis points unfavorable to last year. We're wrapping on a $5 million gain from last year and we incurred $3 million of impairments related to a handful of closings anticipated for this year. Interest expense increased 30 basis points versus last year due to the financing expenses related to the Ruth's Chris acquisition. And for the quarter, adjusted earnings after tax was 7.9% of sales flat to last year. Now turning to our segments. Sales increased at Olive Garden and LongHorn driven by same-restaurant sales and traffic growth. This sales growth along with labor productivity and higher overall pricing related to inflation drove segment profit margin increases of 230 basis points at both Olive Garden and LongHorn. Fine Dining segment total sales increased with the addition of Ruth's Chris company-owned restaurants, but same-restaurant sales were negative at both Capital Grille and Eddie V's consistent with what we indicated on our earnings call last quarter. This resulted in lower segment profit margin for fine dining than last year. As we anticipated, the year-over-year same-restaurant sales decline in our Fine Dining segment was the result of ramping on a resurgence of demand in the first quarter last year that drove traffic retention to 107% of pre-COVID levels. Fine dining traffic retention in the first quarter of this year was 100% of pre-COVID levels more in line with the retention levels for the prior three quarters. The other business segment increased sales driven by positive same-restaurant sales and the addition of Ruth's Chris franchised and managed locations royalty revenue resulting in 140 basis points of segment profit margin growth. As a reminder, all of our franchise operating results are included in the other business segments. Now, I'd like to provide an update on Ruth's synergies. As Rick mentioned, we've identified more synergies than we had initially expected and are choosing to reinvest some of them in the guest and team member experience at Ruth's Chris. Previously, we anticipated $20 million in annualized run rate synergies. We now expect approximately $35 million of gross run rate synergies and other cost savings and we anticipate investing approximately $10 million into the business, resulting in annualized net run rate synergies of approximately $25 million. And for fiscal 2024, we now expect approximately $12 million of net synergies. Finally, as shared in the press release distributed this morning, we are reiterating our full year financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Our outlook still anticipates adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.55 to $8.85, including Ruth's Chris operating results, but excludes approximately $55 million of pre-tax transaction and integration-related costs. And with that, we'll take your questions. Hey, Andrew. Thanks for the question. So let's start with the guidance, right? So as you think about our first quarter performance that was actually from a top line perspective, it was pretty consistent with our plan. We were within 10 basis points of our same restaurant plan we had. So the year from a top line is playing out the way we expected. So as far as -- and so that's really the trust behind how -- why we're not changing the guidance for the year. And now look, we're one quarter in, there's a lot of uncertainty out there. There's three quarters to go, and we had a range to begin with. And while we outperformed our expectations on the bottom line, we feel like it gives us a little bit of a head start, but it still puts \u2013 the point estimate is still within the range we provided at the beginning of the year. Yeah, Brian. So if you think about our inflation expectation for the first quarter, we were about 1 point better than we thought, mostly driven by, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, other categories. The beef is still a lot of uncertainty around beef and you saw from our coverage that we don't have a lot of coverage beyond, especially, as we get into the holidays and past. So there is some uncertainty around it. Now that favorability in the first quarter helps us a little bit. So what that might mean is that we might be a little bit lower in that guidance range we provided of approximately 2.5%. So maybe it's a little bit south of that. But there's three more quarters to go, and beef is really -- I mean, there's a lot of risk with beef, so... Look, I think it's -- I don't -- we don't expect a huge quarter-to-quarter sequential change. Obviously, we are relaunching now running possible that does help and that's part of the reason why we do it in the second quarter is with the back-to-school and there's a little bit of a lull and a slowdown in the casual dining and that's really the time frame. And basically, that's within our range. I mean, I think as we look at last year to this year, there's going to be some nuances with respect to pricing being a little bit lower this -- as we get into the second quarter than first quarter. But I don't want to contemplate exactly what it's going to look quarter-to-quarter. Yeah. So route synergies, generally, where we're getting them is between both the entire supply chain as well as in the G&A, right? So we initially started with an estimate as we go through the year, we're finding that as we are now in the process, we've been able to identify more, and it's in both places. So from an investment perspective, we have a long history of investing in the guest and team member experience across our brands. And so we're investing some of these additional synergies and cost savings in a similar manner, with investments that the routes guests and team members will notice and appreciate. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. As we've mentioned a couple of things, right. G&A was higher than we expected for the first quarter. Part of that was driven by our outperformance on the bottom line. I mentioned earlier that while sales were more in line, we did outperform on the bottom line that helped that cost a little bit more incentive comp. And then stock-based comp, that is truly a onetime. I mean that's more of a timing, but it's pulling forward some from future years, right? But as we look at the full year, G&A is likely to be a little bit higher than what we talked about last quarter. So I think last quarter, we talked about closer to $430 million. I would say, at this point, it's probably closer to $440 million on the year. And David, on the returns, we are -- our returns are still pretty strong. We are -- any project we approve has to be net present value accretive to us. And as Rick mentioned, we generally like to have a little bit of headroom within our margin of error as we approve projects. Maybe that buffer is not as high as it used to be. But when we look at actual performance on average, we exceed our internal hurdles by quite a bit. Yeah, David. I think it's a fair question. But we're just one quarter in, right? So there's nine months to go. There's been mixed data on the consumer. We're trying to understand what's going to happen. And so we felt like it was too early to really come off of the range we provided. As I said earlier, our point estimate from the beginning of the year to now has moved up a little bit. I mean that's because of our performance in the first quarter, but that doesn't mean we're outside the range. So we didn't feel like we're at a place where we needed to change the guidance range. And there's -- so to your question around uncertainty, there are a few things. Primary biggest risk is obviously on the consumer, what happens with the consumer. Second is on the commodities. We're trying to understand what's going to happen, especially with beef, 22% of our basket is beef. So there's some risk there. Now the pricing in beef has remained pretty high because of the supply being down in the mid-single digits. We're starting to see some additional imports that might help on the beef front, but it's too early. So I guess all things considered at this point, we felt like it was prudent to stay with the guidance we provided. Yeah, Josh. I think from a geography perspective, we're seeing more strength in New England, Northeast, we're seeing some softness or at least below company average in California, Texas and Florida when we look at the entire portfolio. Now brand by brand, there's a little bit of variability. But when you look at across our portfolio, that's the areas where we're seeing in terms of regional differences. Most others are kind of in between, and so kind of closer to the company average, if you will. But definitely seeing strength in the Northeast and especially New England area overall. From a daypart perspective, we are seeing some lunch getting better at casual brands. And so that's really it. Outside of that, I don't know that there's any additional color we can provide on the sales detail. Okay. So let me -- yeah, you're right on the year over. It's really driven by a function of last year on the softness I'm talking about in those markets or the strength because last year, they were in a different place. So that's a one year -- truly a one-year thing, and then I'll let Rick comment on the marketing. Yeah, Dennis. Our off-premise has gone quite a bit from where we were before COVID. So from a traffic perspective, yeah, we're probably in that 80% range in terms of traffic relative to pre-COVID at our largest brand in Olive Garden. But from a sales perspective, we're probably closer to where we were before COVID. Now with that said, but part of that is, as we talked about, we made a conscious decision to pull back a lot on promotional activity, couponing and marketing dollars that we spend at Olive Garden. So we're a healthier business. And so we like where we are. From the -- but also -- it also gives us opportunity, right? There is capacity in the dining room, which provides us more opportunity, but we're going to go at it in a way that's durable. That is actually not a one-time get people in the door, but we want to build it over time. That's why we're so focused on core menu, everyday value and executing at the highest levels we can so that we can slowly build back. Well, I would say, our traffic was actually a little bit better than we thought going into the quarter, but our mix was a little bit worse. So what we're seeing is from a check perspective at Olive Garden and LongHorn, a little bit of pullback in alcohol sales and some entree mix -- negative entree mix. But that's really what I can share at this point. So Danilo, let me start with saying where we are from a pricing standpoint. Our overall pricing in the quarter was about 6%, as we said. We expect the full year to be closer to mid-3%s maybe closer to 3% to 4%, 3.5% to 4%. That said, when you look at where we are related to pre-COVID, our pricing over that time frame is in that 17% to 18%, including this quarter that we just talked about is 18%. Where the peers are, on average are about 600 basis points to 700 basis points higher than us over that time frame, which means that we have created a gap. Now most of our pricing this quarter is a wrap from pricing actions we took last year. In fact, I think the impact from this year -- the actions this year make up less than 10% of our total pricing. So we -- the carryover from last year represents 3%. So overall, from a pricing strategy perspective, we feel like we're in a great place. We feel like we have created the gap to our competitors and that gap is not going to get any narrower. We don't expect that when we end the year that maybe quarter-to-quarter, there may be tens of basis points of delta to our peers. But when we look at it overall, we feel like we're going to be still ahead of competition. Part of that is because our inflation that we experience is better than most of our peers and we try to target our own inflation in terms of how we price. But our inflation because of our scale ends up being generally much less than especially some of the local peers you're talking about. Yeah. I'd say, we're looking at probably closer to 5% in the second quarter, 3%-ish by the time we get to third quarter and probably closer to 2% or below 2% by the time we get to fourth quarter. Yes, Sara. So let me try to make sure I answer all the aspects of that question. So let's start with the margins. So from a margin perspective, yes, you're right. If you just look at absolute pricing and commodities inflation or overall inflation and you could say, well, you didn't get the full delta between the pricing and inflation. The things we have to think about are a few things. One, there is a negative mix. First of all, let's start with the brand mix. When you have negative comps at our -- some of our high-margin brands that has a negative impact on our overall blended margin. And you saw that LongHorn and Olive Garden had 230 basis points each of segment profit margin, which is really what -- where you're seeing the most strength. The decline in fine dining, part of that is driven by incremental costs they have year-over-year. Their pricing is starting to catch up. But also, there was some negative mix, on a one-year basis, there was a lot of negative mix on alcohol. When we look at what's happening with -- at Fine Dining, there is trading down to lower-priced wines and other alcohols on a one-year basis. However, when we look at it versus where we were pre-COVID, we don't see a big fall-off. So this feels like there was -- clearly goes back to that exuberance that existed a year ago that we're wrapping on. And so part of that margin impact is from that. And then, the last piece I'd say is, some of the restaurant expenses still have high inflation, whether it's repairs and maintenance, we're running mid-single digit inflation on those lines and so that's part of that. Last piece is utilities. We had a record summer -- record heat. So that caused tremendous usage, much -- we've ever seen historically in terms of electric usage and that translated into some incremental cost to. Yeah, Peter. I would say on the casual brands, we're only seeing it at Olive Garden and LongHorn and it's not alarming. What we're talking about is tens of basis points of negative mix. So it's not at a point where we're like, hey, we're missing check by quite a bit. But it's about -- in an environment where you have a pricing in that 6% range in the -- take an example, the last quarter, to have maybe 50 basis points of negative mix. It doesn't feel like it's a huge impact, but it was a little bit worse than we expected. But we're not reading too much into that, primarily because when we look at what's happening at Cheddar's, we're not seeing a negative mix there. So -- and the other part of it is we have introduced some menu items that are more -- at LongHorn, for an example, we have some items that are better margin, pricing difference there might be causing people to trade down, but it's not hurting our margins. So we're actually okay with that some negative entree mix we're seeing. So it's too early to draw too much into the -- to kind of read too much into this negative mix that we're seeing on the check at the casual brands. From fine dining, yeah, we truly believe it is a function of exuberance last year. We were seeing a huge positive mix last year and that's going away. I mean we've actually had that for four or five quarters until -- I think until we got through to the second quarter of last year. And so now we're starting to things normalize. And this is -- that's why when we wanted to look at it versus pre-COVID and when we look at it through that lens, we did not see any big drop off at the fine dining. Yeah, John. Actually, what we are -- we are continuing to see actually the consumers below 35 be actually continuing to grow as a mix. In fact, when we look at versus last year versus last quarter and as well as versus pre-COVID, consumers below 35 are still trending better. In fact, and then 55 plus, especially 65-plus is still below pre-COVID and actually a slight decline from last quarter to this quarter. So we -- so it feels like from a mix perspective, we're seeing more younger consumer. And we're kind of seeing something along the lines of what Rick mentioned on the income spectrum too, where our lower income makes up a bigger percentage of our guest base today than it did before COVID. But we're not seeing any cracks in that those trends because we've been tracking that for a few quarters now and it seems to be holding up pretty well. Now if is something going to change in the future, we can -- and at this point, we don't have any insight to say whether that's going to change or not. Hey, Brian. so Olive Garden was about 22%, a little over 22%. So that's about a couple of points lower than where we were a year ago. This is not one of the high quarters. And then from a LongHorn perspective, they were about 13% off-premise. From a traffic perspective, I'd say Olive Garden was low-single digit or slightly positive. It might have been 0.3%, 0.4%. LongHorn was in the 1.5% range for traffic. Hey, John. I think we -- what we talked about, if you recall, a year ago, was there was opportunity to get some margin back at LongHorn. Part of that was we had made -- LongHorn's team had made some strategic choices along the way to make investments in food quality and invest well below -- at pricing well below inflation as they were growing traffic. And LongHorn, by the way, does have significant -- actually positive traffic in the dining room relative to pre-COVID. And so we're at a place where we now can pivot a little bit back to getting some of the margin that we wanted to get and so LongHorn team has done a great job getting to some of that margin growth. And we feel like we're in a much better place from an overall business model perspective, especially given the top line momentum they have to be able to see the margins where they are. It's just -- it provides strong returns within our portfolio. Okay. Let me first start with the coverage. So yeah, you pointed out, we have about 55% coverage for the next six months, which is actually the same as what we had a year ago, but a bit lower than what we would have had before COVID. In terms of the ability to get coverage, I would say at this point, it's still difficult to secure long-term coverage at the prices we like for beef and that's really the primary driver. If you look at our coverage, we don't have as much coverage in beef as we would have liked to at this point in time. And then the other point, as poultry, you see that we have about 65% covered, but normally, we're much more covered in that. Part of that is because we renewed -- we started a contract last year in December that actually just expires this December. So we're in the midst of trying to renegotiate that. And so that's kind of the reason why we're a little bit lower. But yeah, you're right. I mean, we would like to have a little bit more coverage. But as I mentioned, beef is still not where it is, would like it to be, especially going past the holidays, it's hard to lock out \u2013 getting into the holiday, December and pass, it's hard to lock in at prices we like. So from a dining room perspective, both LongHorn and Olive Garden had traffic growth in the quarter, right? So that means that some of the guests this off-premise question you asked, it's shifting to the dining room. So we're not concerned because, yeah, off-premise was down a couple of points that Olive Garden gotten year-over-year, but that means the dining room grew by more than 2 points. And that's -- we're happy with that. We actually prefer to have guests in the dining room."

            "name": "Rick Cardenas",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Thanks, Kevin. We had a strong quarter as we continued to outperform the industry benchmarks for same-restaurant sales and traffic. For the quarter, total sales were $2.7 billion, an increase of 11.6% and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.78. We also opened 10 new restaurants in nine different states during the quarter. Our ability to drive profitable sales growth is a testament to the strength of our business model and adherence to our strategy. We continue to strengthen and leverage our four competitive advantages of significant scale, extensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and a results-oriented culture, while our restaurant teams remain intensely focused on executing our back-to-basics operating philosophy, anchored in food, service and atmosphere. This focus on being growing with the basics continues to drive strong guest satisfaction. In fact, our internal guest satisfaction metrics remain at or near all-time highs across all our brands. Additionally, several of our brands continue to rank number one among major casual dining brands in key measurement categories within Technomic's industry tracking tool, including LongHorn Steakhouse for food quality and taste, and Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for value. Our team members bring our brands to life each day, and we know engaged team members are vital to creating great guest experiences. That's why our brands are focused on leveraging their unique cultures to strengthen team member engagement. For example, LongHorn Steakhouse created the Grill Masters Legends program that honors Grill Masters, who have grilled more than 1 million stakes throughout their career, which typically takes more than 20 years for a team member to accomplish. Five Grill Masters Legends were honored during the quarter, bringing the total to 25 team members, who have received this recognition. Also during the quarter, Yard House completed its first Best On Tap competition. Known for having more than 130 beers on-tap, Yard House tested its bar tenders from every restaurant, giving them the opportunity to showcase their beverage knowledge, parting expertise and service skills. Congratulations to this year's winner, Alyssa Hurley from the Yard House in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, who was named Best On Tap. Programs like these give us an opportunity to celebrate team members who play a critical role in the guest experience and who serve as torchbearers for their brand culture. One of the most significant ways our brands drive culture is through their annual leadership conferences, which provide the opportunity to get in front of every general manager and managing partner across all our restaurants to discuss the plans for the year and generate excitement among our operators. I was pleased to see the high levels of engagement and strong alignment on what our restaurant teams must do to continue creating exceptional guest experiences across each of our iconic brands. To further strengthen our brands, we are focused on highlighting what makes each one unique. That's why when it comes to marketing, any activity our brands undertake is evaluated through three filters. First, it needs to elevate brand equity by bringing the brand's competitive advantages to life. Second, it should be simple to execute. We will not jeopardize all the work we have done to simplify operations, which allows our teams to consistently deliver memorable guest experiences. And finally, it will not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests, but doing so in a way that drives profitable sales growth. A great example of this activity was the Capital Grille's, Generous Poor event that took place during the quarter. This specially curated wine experience allows guests to sample award-winning wines that pair with items on the Capital Grille menu. And in the second quarter, Olive Garden is bringing back Never Ending Pasta Bowl, which brings to life its competitive advantage of Never Ending Abundant Craveable Italian food. Olive Garden's eClub members received a special invitation to begin enjoying NEPV this week. This guest favorite returns for everybody on Monday and will be offered at the same price point as last year. Turning to Ruth's Chris. Since the day, we announced the completion of the acquisition, we have been guided by three key objectives. First, we want to preserve the team member experience and the brand's unique culture. Ruth's Chris has many long-tenured team members and we are committed to ensuring this is a people focused process. The team is engaged and we have strong buying across the executive and operations leadership levels, all of which helps ensure a smooth transition. Next, we want to maintain and even strengthen the guest experience. Ruth's Chris is an incredibly strong brand and it ranks as one of the top brands across multiple metrics within Technomic's industry tracking tool. We now expect to realize more synergies than we originally anticipated and we plan to reinvest some of them in the guest and team member experience. Raj will provide more details during his remarks. And last, we want to successfully migrate Ruth's Chris under the Darden platform. The team leading the integration is wrapping up the planning stage and we're about to embark on the hardest part, the actual conversion to new systems and processes. We know that it's not easy, which is why we plan to complete it in phases over the next nine months to limit disruptions as much as possible. Looking across our entire portfolio, I am pleased with the quarter. Our strategy is working, we continue to grow share, strengthen margins and make meaningful investments in our business while returning capital to shareholders. And while I'm proud of our continued success, there is a larger purpose to what we do, and that is to nourish and delight everyone we serve. Not just within the four walls of our restaurants, but in the communities that our guests and team members call home. September is hunger action month and we are uniquely positioned to help fight hunger. This marks the 20th anniversary of our Harvest program. Since 2003, our restaurants have collected excess nutritious food that was not served to guests and prepared it for weekly donation to local non-profit partners. Over the life of the program, we have donated the equivalent of more than 113 million meals. And for the past 13 years, we have partnered with Feeding America to help fight hunger. Over that time, the Darden Foundation has donated more than $16 million to support their network of more than 200 food banks. Last week, together with our partners, Penske Truck Leasing and Lineage Logistics, we added 10 more refrigerated trucks for mobile food pantry programs at 10 local food banks. To date, we have added a total of 35 trucks across Feeding America food banks in 18 states. Our ability to make a difference in the fight against hunger would not be possible without the efforts of our 190,000 team members and their passion to nourish and delight everyone we serve. I'm grateful for everything you do to help make our company successful. Now I will turn it over to Raj. Hey, Brian. This is Rick. Overall, we think the consumers continues to be resilient, but there seems to be a little bit more selective. We are seeing a little softness versus last year with household incomes above $125,000 and that primarily affects our fine dining brands, but it does affect all of our brands. Now this could be because the increase in luxury travel, particularly international travel, which you've heard a lot of people talk about. But as I've said before, many times, there is attention to being what people want to pay and what they can afford, and they're going to continue to seek value, not always about low price. They're making trade-offs and food away from home is one of the most difficult things they can give up. So again, what does that mean for our brands? We believe that operators deliver on their brand promise and value will continue to be with consumers. And so we're going to keep doing that. We're going to deliver our promise. We're going to execute our brands and we're going to keep doing that and deliver value to our guests. And I'm confident we're well positioned for whatever we have to deal with. Thanks to the breadth of our portfolio and the outstanding team members in our restaurants who are committed to exceptional guest experiences. Our marketing programs, we told you what we're going to do with marketing in the prepared remarks. It's again at whatever we do is going to elevate brand equity. It's not going to be a deep discount and it's going to be simple to operate. And if it means that our traffic is at the lower end of our guide and then it's at the lower end of our guide. We're not going to do things that are going to impact us in the long-term just for short-term. Hey, David. Thanks. In regards to development and unit growth, we do want to get to the top end of our long-term framework of 3% unit -- sales growth from new restaurants. As we've said in the past, there's still some permitting delays. We're seeing a little less on the utility connections and those kind of things, but we're still -- it's still taking a little longer to get permits. We also are being a little selective, especially where inflation and costs have made the economics of the deal is a little less attractive. And we generally like to have good margin of error with our projects. And so we've turned down a few projects that just because costs are a little higher than we wanted them to be. And we've done that in the past, and we've been able to get back to those same projects at the costs that are more reasonable for us. So we're willing to wait a little bit to get the cost back more in line. That said, we believe inflation has peaked and we are starting to receive more bids that are in line with our project budgets and some even actually below our project budgets. So that gives us some good feelings for the future. We still believe we have the opportunity to grow close to the high end of our framework and we are actively building that pipeline. Yeah. And David, I'm going to add one more thing. If you think about us saying that we'd like to see a little bit of a buffer in our net present value over our cost of capital, that's because we have all the capital we need and so we're going to be selective in projects. And the thing that's going to keep us from growing way faster than our long-term framework unit growth is having people ready to run those restaurants and that's what we focus on as well. We're focusing on developing people and we think we've got a great pipeline of people as well. Yeah, Dave. You're right. We're not going to give you too much information on what we would do. But just understand that we believe that the best long-term health of our business is to keep our strategy of overall pricing below inflation, running better restaurants and not getting into a huge deep discounting to buy guests. We think that brings in the guests that just come in that are a little bit less core to our business and we're going to continue to operate our restaurants to drive one more visit from our core guests. And if that means that others start doing some heavy discounting, we're going to stick to our strategy. And even if it means that it's a short term, it impacts us a little bit in the short term because we think we'll be better off in the long term if we stay with where we're going. Yeah, Jeff. One thing, yeah, commodities might be easing, but labor is still pretty high. If not -- it's getting a little bit better. But even if commodities are deflationary, there's still net inflation, at least in our business, and I'm guessing in other business too. That said, we have seen a slight increase in promotional activity, but particularly with one barn grill competitor and in the family dining segment. We're really not seeing a whole lot of competitive increase in competitive activity in kind of the Olive Garden range and above other than, as I said, that one bar and grill competitor that seems to be ramping up a little bit. Well, I said, Olive Garden is usually one of the top brands in share of voice. So no matter what this competitive activity is and television activity. Olive Garden is usually one of the top few brands in share of voice, but our message is about more and more and more. Come in to Olive Garden for more, more food, more value, more refills. And that's what we're talking about. And as I said, we'll stick to our strategy. And I'd tell you, that's reinforced Never Ending Pasta Bowl. So Never Ending Pasta Bowl is about never ending craveable by an Italian food at a great value, and it's right on our plan. We're doing exactly what we planned for at the beginning of this fiscal year with Never Ending Pasta Bowl, nothing new. Yeah, Jeff. We actually do think seasonality is getting back to historic trends. And the data we talked about for fine dining with getting back to kind of 100% of pre-COVID levels. We're seeing the same thing. I'm not saying at the 100%, but the same kind of trends back towards similar trends of pre-COVID levels now, where last year, we do think there was a little bit of pent-up demand. And so we're going to watch it. We're going to see what happens for the rest of this month and the rest of next month. But it appears like, now we're getting much closer to what the seasonal patterns were. Yeah. Yeah, Josh. I think now that we're seeing that we think we're getting back to more seasonal patterns. We look at our traffic trends versus pre-COVID. They're fairly consistent across the last four quarters across most of our brand -- actually, in most of our segments. And so we believe what we're doing is getting us to exactly where we were before without a bunch of marketing with at maybe slightly lower traffic levels because of that marketing. And so we're going to stick to what we're doing and see if the patterns dramatically change. And if they do, we have levers to pull that aren't necessarily deep discounts. And one of them that we just pulled with Never Ending Pasta Bowl was to give our eClub members a preview of Never Ending Pasta Bowl, which again was always in our plan. It was in our plan at the beginning of this fiscal year. It's not something we're doing differently we're doing it to learn. If we give our eClub members a little bit more reason to be in the club without giving them a discount to be in the club, then maybe that's going to drive more. So we're still learning, and we're looking at digital marketing and other things that we've done and we've learned throughout COVID. And if we do anything, we could use those levers but not necessarily deep discounts. Hey, Danilo. As we mentioned earlier, we are finished the planning process and we're about to embark on the hardest part, but it's only going to take us nine months. So think about integrating 80 owned and operated Ruth's Chris restaurants, thinking about the franchise systems, getting all of our operated restaurants on our point-of-sale system, on our payroll system and all of the other systems. We don't want to go too much faster than nine months just because that's a lot of disruption in the restaurant. So we're going to pace it at the right level. We've already -- as we've said, we've brought our synergy estimate up for this year from $5 million to $10 million, I believe, to $12 million this year about and that includes reinvesting some of the synergies that we found. So that would tell you that we got a little bit faster. But we wanted to make investments just like we do in our other brands. So if we get even faster on some of the synergies we see that the synergies are even higher than we've just analyzed then we may make more investments. And so, we'll do what is right for the long-term health of the business, but we're not going to try to integrate too fast and we're going to stay at our pace. Yeah, Jeff. I'm going to start with seasonality, as we've talked a couple of times, this is -- September is typically the low seasonal pattern. Last year, it wasn't, the same thing with August. And so I would start by saying seasonal patterns are getting back -- more back to normal when you compare all of our segments to pre-COVID levels, over the last four quarters, we've been pretty consistent. And so the other thing, as we've already mentioned, is there is -- the consumer is starting to have a little bit less confidence and they're a little bit more selective. And so we're going to continue to work on what we've worked on. But I think that pricing in the industry may have caused a little bit of this, but we've been pricing well below the industry and we feel good about where our pricing position is compared to everybody else and we're just going to execute. Yeah, Jon. Let me start by saying the fast act you're talking about in California. I know it impacts fast food first and that could lead to higher wages across other segments of the dining experience. Our employment proposition is great. We've got a great employment proposition. As we talk about and I think we've mentioned before, our average wages, including tips are over $22 now across the country. But when you look it in California, it's higher than that. And so I think as labor costs continue to grow, we've had that in other markets where we've seen minimum wages grow or we've seen a reduction in the tip credit, and we've been able to execute and continue to gain share there. So if this does impact restaurants, it's probably going to impact the ones that have a little less capital and a little less the ability to withstand that. Just like we've seen in other markets where wages have grown really fast. We've been able to pick up share because we're still there. So we're going to focus on what we can control, which is providing a great guest experience and trying to continue to price below inflation. And if inflation is higher, others are going to have to price more and we'll be able to gain share by taking a little less price. We're going to stick to our strategy. Nothing is ever off the table, if things change dramatically on inflation. What we talked about with the pricing actions that we've already taken, most of our pricing is already built in. But that 2% that Raj said in Q4 could be higher if things change. And it's highly unlikely, it could be lower, but it could be higher if things change. Yeah. Yes, Sara. Our marketing versus prior year was up 20 basis points, about half of that was just roots mix. So bringing roots into the mix. Our marketing was a little bit higher. And the other 10% was already in our plan. So the planned performance included the tenth in marketing. So we believe we're getting an ROI on that. And we've learned over during the COVID times how to -- we've been able to analyze marketing better because when you completely eliminate it and you start adding back, you can really see the impact of it versus when you have a lot of it and you add a little bit, it's harder to see. So we're able to read the marketing much better in the ROIs and marketing, and we believe there is one. Yeah. We're seeing it much easier to hire than we have in the last few years. We've gotten much more applicants for every job than we've had before. If you think about the employment proposition that we've mentioned, it includes a minimum wage of $12 an hour, including gratuities (ph). And as we're seeing, yes, wage inflation is up, but our starting wage inflation is lower than our overall inflation. So it seems like it's getting a little bit easier to hire people, and we don't have to hire at such a high rate, just to get people in the door. We're fully staffed. Our turnover is getting coming down. And so our starting wage inflation is much lower or our entry-level wage inflation when people come to work for us is lower than our overall inflation, which is a good time. Yeah, Greg. I think a couple of things. One, if you look over the last few years, wage growth has been higher at the lower income level and at the higher income level and inflation while it impacts the lower income more, their wages had grown faster than inflation over time. And I kind of mentioned it. I think a little bit of it now is the exuberance from last year and actually this summer, there was a lot of international travel. You saw that when airlines talked about adding roots internationally, and that could have been part of the reason maybe our Florida and California markets weren't as strong because maybe people weren't traveling here, they were traveling outside the U.S. because they hadn't been able to do that for a few years. I know anecdotally, I've talked to quite a few folks that have had international travel plans in their sights for two or three years, but they were just not doing it because of COVID, and they did it this summer. So it could be because we've had a lot of that. We're not reading too much into it. That said, we're going to watch and monitor and see, and see if something dramatically changes, but we're not too concerned right now. We just wanted to make sure that you understood that the $125,000 and up is something that we're seeing a little softness in or at least we did in the first quarter. Yeah, Greg. I want to start by saying, we're really -- our focus is integrating our current restaurants. We've got 81 company-operated restaurants into Darden. Our Ruth's Chris franchise, these are valued partners to us. If they have growth opportunities and they want to continue to grow and it makes sense, then we'll let them grow with us. But we expect to grow our own Ruth's restaurants as well. So I would anticipate that over time, the mix of Ruth's company-owned or company operated compared to franchise will go down. It doesn't necessarily mean that franchise -- number of franchises will get on, it's because we're going to open more restaurants at Ruth's. And so that's how we're going to stick to it. Hey, John. I think about reattracting any consumer. We're trying to add one more visit from our loyal guests and we had a lot of loyal guests above 65. I do believe that they were a little bit more spooked on the COVID side and they should have been. If COVID have impacted them a little bit more. And we're going to continue to focus our efforts. And if we can do some targeted marketing to them, we've got a big e-club. We can use our eClub to talk to them and say, hey, come back to Olive Garden. But I don't think we're going to do some dramatic things because we've actually seen a pretty big increase in our younger consumer. And I think if people would have asked us five years ago to say, hey, we don't have enough younger consumers, they would have thought, wow, I can't believe how many consumers you've had on the younger side. So we actually like that consumer. We think that consumer is going to be a strong consumer for us, but we value all of our customers, including those over 65 and we'd love to see them come back more frequently. Yeah, Brian. On the Ruth's customer base, a lot of our customer research is based on data that we get through our POS and we haven't done the integration of POS. So I'm just using some data that we have from the past. It's a slightly different consumer than we see at Capital Grille and Eddie V's. And as we've mentioned before, we have very little overlap in the consumer for Ruth's Chris and the consumer for Capital Grille and Eddie V's. So that's a good thing. We're reaching a consumer for a different need state than they've had before. Ruth's is a little bit more suburban than the other brands that we've mentioned. And so we're going to continue to learn more about that consumer. In regards to the investments that we've made or that we're going to be making, as Raj said, we have a history of making investments in our team and in our food. And those are the kind of investments we're going to be making with these additional synergies more on the food side, but still some investments on the team side. I don't want to get into the exact investments that we're making now. Sure. Yeah, Jake. As we've said before, the restaurant industry is impacted really more about discretionary spending. We don't expect consumer repayment of student loans is going to be a material impact to Darden over time. And recall that a lot of these have already started being made. So I think in the month of August or -- month of August, it was about $1 billion a week. And that could be because some people are just deciding to pay off their entire student loan before the interest rate starts back up. And so the expectation was it's going to be about $80 billion or so a year in student loan repayment and we're almost at that run rate now. So -- and I also know I've read and seen, and I think you've all read that a lot of these student loan payments are the folks that are above $125,000. So maybe that's part of it as well. Maybe they've started to pay off their student loan. So we want to see how this progresses over time. But as we've said, we don't think it's going to be a meaningful impact to our business on the margins, it could be an impact, but it's not going to be a meaningful impact to our business. Discretionary spending is a bigger impact. Yeah. I didn't mean to laugh. But when you talked about my BMI, I'm not going to get into that. I don't know about that. Let me start by saying full-service dining occasions are driven by desire to connect with family and friends. Our -- if you think about the frequency of our full servers dining gas is a couple of times 2 times, 3 times a year for a good guess. So over the years, we have spent a lot of time designing our menus to ensure guests have a wide range of choices to suit their individual needs. And we're going to react to whatever happens, but we don't think it's going to be a meaningful impact to us because of the celebratory nature with for people, why people come out to eat. And if it suppresses appetite a little bit, they're still going to eat. So we're going to be there for them when they do."
